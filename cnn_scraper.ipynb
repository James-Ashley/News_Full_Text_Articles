      " (CNN)A federal judge dealt a death blow to the Trump campaign's effort to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's win of the presidency on Saturday, by dismissing a closely watched lawsuit that sought to invalidate millions of Pennsylvania votes.\n",
      "\"It is not in the power of this Court to violate the Constitution,\" Judge Matthew Brann of the US District Court in the Middle District of Pennsylvania wrote on Saturday in a withering decision, hours after the final round of filings in the case came in. The judge wholeheartedly rejected the Trump campaign's attempt to throw out the Pennsylvania vote, noting that Biden has won the state and results will be certified by state officials on Monday. Biden has a margin of more than 81,000 votes in the state.\n",
      "RELATED: CNN's live results from the presidential election\n",
      "\"In the United States of America, this cannot justify the disenfranchisement of a single voter, let alone all the voters of its sixth most populated state. Our people, laws, and institutions demand more,\" the judge wrote. \"At bottom, Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\"\n",
      "Though the case was always extremely unlikely to succeed, President Donald Trump's backers and legal team -- and particularly his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani -- had pinned their hopes on the federal judge in Pennsylvania giving some credibility to their suspicions of fraud and entertaining Trump's attempt to overturn the popular vote for Biden.\n",
      "But Brann, a longtime and well-known Republican in Pennsylvania, refused. \n",
      "Shortly after the decision came down, Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania congratulated Biden as the President-elect, breaking from party leaders and a vast majority of congressional Republicans who continue to back Trump's efforts to challenge the results. \n",
      "This was essentially the last major case seeking to throw out or block enough votes that could swing a key state in Trump's favor, and Brann's decision on Saturday is at least the 30th loss or withdrawal of a case from the Trump campaign and its allies since Election Day. There have only been two wins in court for Republicans, about very small numbers of votes.   \n",
      "\"Plaintiffs ask this Court to disenfranchise almost seven million voters. This Court has been unable to find any case in which a plaintiff has sought such a drastic remedy in the contest of an election, in terms of the sheer volume of votes asked to be invalidated,\" Brann wrote Saturday.\n",
      "In the case, Trump's legal team led by Giuliani had attempted to claim that the Equal Protection rights of two Pennsylvania voters were violated because the state had allowed counties to decide whether absentee ballots sent in with technical problems could be fixed by the voters. The two voters in the lawsuit said that in their counties, they were not allowed to \"cure\" their ballots, and thus had their ballots rejected, while other counties, like heavily Democratic Philadelphia County, allowed voters to \"cure\" absentee ballots. That discrepancy, they claimed, meant that Pennsylvania's election results in their entirety should be blocked by court order, which theoretically, could deprive Biden of the state's 20 Electoral College votes. \n",
      "Brann called the legal reasoning behind the Trump campaign's Equal Protection claim \"Frankenstein's Monster.\"\n",
      "\"The answer to invalidated ballots is not to invalidate millions more,\" Brann wrote.\n",
      "Brann also admonished the Trump campaign for presenting no factual proof of voter fraud or other allegations -- evidence that Giuliani and Trump's supporters have repeatedly said is in the works but has never materialized. Elections officials in multiple states as well as judges have said there was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election.\n",
      "Giuliani, who had swept into the case at the last minute ahead of a hearing on Tuesday before Brann, has been widely criticized for ignoring legal reasoning, leading a team that's made sloppy mistakes in its filings, and for pushing nonsensical and unfounded claims of conspiracy against Trump in Democratic-leaning cities. \n",
      "\"One might expect that when seeking such a startling outcome, a plaintiff would come formidably armed with compelling legal arguments and factual proof of rampant corruption, such that this Court would have no option but to regrettably grant the proposed injunctive relief despite the impact it would have on such a large group of citizens. That has not happened,\" Brann added. \"Instead, this Court has been presented with strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations, unpled in the operative complaint and unsupported by evidence.\" \n",
      "The counties in the state are scheduled to certify their election results on Monday.\n",
      "The judge said any further consideration of this issue \"would unduly delay resolution of the issues\" regarding certification, and he closed the case. His order on Saturday notes that the Trump campaign cannot try to resurface their claims in a rejiggered version of the lawsuit.\n",
      "The Trump campaign on Saturday night said they would appeal Brann's ruling, and quickly, with the intention of taking the case to the US Supreme Court.\n",
      "Toomey emerged as a rare Republican voice so far acknowledging Trump's legal avenues have come to an end. \n",
      "\"With today's decision by Judge Matthew Brann, a longtime conservative Republican whom I know to be a fair and unbiased jurist, to dismiss the Trump campaign's lawsuit, President Trump has exhausted all plausible legal options to challenge the result of the presidential race in Pennsylvania,\" the GOP senator said in a statement.\n",
      "\"These developments, together with the outcomes in the rest of the nation, confirm that Joe Biden won the 2020 election and will become the 46th President of the United States.\"\n",
      "Mike Gwin, a spokesperson for Biden, praised the decision to dismiss the lawsuit. \n",
      "\"The judge's ruling couldn't be clearer: our people, laws, and institutions demand more — and our country will not tolerate Trump's attempt to reverse the results of an election that he decisively lost,\" Gwin said in a statement. \n",
      "Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro also praised the decision in a statement Saturday night. \"These claims were meritless from the start and for an audience of one. The will of the people will prevail. These baseless lawsuits need to end,\" he said.\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)ICE agents raid a big-box store, racing down the aisles to apprehend an employee. A DACA recipient who\\'s a doctor frets over her future. And a family separated by deportation struggles to connect on the phone. \\nThese scenes on TV shows aren\\'t just quick plot twists ripped from the headlines in the age-old tradition of primetime television. They\\'re part of a deeper effort behind the scenes to shape new immigrant characters and storylines.  \\nAnd an advocacy group known as Define American is leading the charge.  \\nTheir hope: That changing the conversations in Hollywood\\'s writers\\' rooms will pave the way for immigration policy changes in Washington, too.  \\n\"This is long-term work,\" says Jose Antonio Vargas, Define American\\'s founder. \"This is not like, \\'How do we pass a bill next month?\\' This is, \\'How do we create a culture in which we see immigrants as people deserving of dignity?\\' These policies don\\'t make sense if we don\\'t see immigrants as people.\" \\nVargas knows the power of TV to shape stories and change minds. After revealing he was an undocumented immigrant in a 2011 New York Times magazine piece, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist became a high-profile advocate and filmmaker whose documentaries appeared on MTV and CNN.\\nWhen he first arrived in the United States from the Philippines in the 1990s, Vargas says that he -- like many immigrants -- got to know his new home by watching TV. \\n\"When we get to this country, our most effective teacher is the television screen. ... The way that I talk is because of all the TV and all the popular culture that I consumed,\" he says. \"For me, the most effective way of becoming American was being exposed to the media.\" \\nNow the organization he founded is flipping that idea on its head.  \\nSo far, Vargas says, Define American has consulted on 75 film and TV projects across 22 networks.\\nThe organization says stories it\\'s shaped have appeared on NBC\\'s \"Superstore,\" ABC\\'s \"Grey\\'s Anatomy,\" OWN\\'s \"Queen Sugar\" and CW\\'s \"Roswell, New Mexico.\" And they hope the list will grow. \\nJust as \"Frasier,\" \"The Golden Girls\" and \"Will \\u200b& Grace\" helped him learn about American slang and society, Vargas says a new generation of TV shows can be a bridge, too — this time helping Americans better understand immigrants\\' stories.\\nThe view from inside the writers\\' room \\nThe first time she spoke with writers from \"Superstore,\" Elizabeth Grizzle Voorhees felt like she had to break some difficult news. \\nA season into the NBC sitcom, which portrays life for workers inside a big-box store, the writers had taken the plot \\u200barc of one prominent character in a direction they hadn\\'t anticipated when the show began: Mateo, who\\'s gay, fiercely competitive and proud of his Filipino heritage, discovered he was undocumented.\\nAnd the show\\'s writers were trying to sort out what to do next.  \\n\"They had a ton of questions,\" says Voorhees, a former reality TV showrunner who\\'s now Define American\\'s \\u200bchief strategy officer. Their top concern: \"How do we get him citizenship?\" \\nThat day, she says, Define American\\'s team explained that the writers\\' top question may be impossible to answer for Mateo, just as it is for millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States.   \\n\"That it might not be possible to resolve that storyline within a season, within a few episodes, or even within multiple seasons,\" Voorhees says.  \\nIt was a message the writers took to heart, according to Justin Spitzer, the show\\'s creator and then-showrunner.  \\n\"I wouldn\\'t want to tell a story where say, Mateo does find this funny way that totally works and makes him a citizen. And none of that is true. I don\\'t think it\\'s good for society that we\\'re spreading a wrong message,\" says Spitzer, now an executive producer of the show.  \\n\"I think as a viewer, if I\\'m watching something and even one time, I see them say something is possible that I know is impossible, that show has largely lost me.\" \\nInstead, he says, Define American\\'s guidance -- along with insights from immigration lawyers and even someone who worked at ICE -- helped the writers shape stories rooted in reality. \\nDefine American would bring panels of undocumented immigrants into the writers\\' room, he says, sparking ideas for entire episodes with each conversation.  \\n\"It became this amazing resource for us. ... Organizations like this are great. They can answer questions, but by just sitting around and talking, we can come up with stories we never even dreamed of before,\" he says.  \\nOne example: an episode in the show\\'s second season when Mateo, desperate for a solution to his immigration woes, tries to get people in the store to assault him so he can be eligible for a visa for crime victims. \\n\\u200bThe sixth season of \"Superstore\" is set to premiere on NBC later this month. Mateo still isn\\'t a citizen. \\nAwareness is growing\\nToday\\'s TV landscape is dotted with immigrant storylines.  \\n\"The Transplant\" on NBC features a Syrian doctor who flees his war-torn country and starts over as a medical resident. Shows streaming on Netflix like \"Never Have I Ever\" and \"Kim\\'s Convenience\" portray immigrant parents with comedy and heart. \"One Day at a Time,\" scheduled to start airing this month on CBS, features Rita Moreno as the immigrant matriarch of a Cuban-American family. On Cinemax, \"Warrior\" tells tales of Chinese immigrant life in 19th-century San Francisco. \\nPopular shows that recently ended their run, like \"Orange is the New Black\" or \"Jane the Virgin,\" were lauded for the immigrant storylines they incorporated into their final seasons. \\nAnd these days, conversations about race and representation once relegated to obscurity are playing a far more prominent role. Lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee recently grilled experts about diversity in Hollywood.\\n\"There is greater awareness than we\\'ve probably ever seen before. ... People are interested in telling diverse stories. They\\'re interested in telling stories that haven\\'t been told before that really can hit home,\" Voorhees says. \\nBut shows with more nuanced portrayals of immigrants like \"Superstore,\" \"One Day at a Time\" or \"Warrior\" still aren\\'t the norm, says Nancy Wang Yuen, a sociologist and author of \"Reel Inequality: Hollywood Actors and Racism.\"   \\n\"We\\'re not telling good immigrant stories. ... There\\'s groups that we are just not talking about because of our stereotypes of who the undocumented immigrants are,\" she says. \\nHow immigrants on TV differ from reality \\nThat\\'s something Define American\\'s leaders say they\\'ve found in their research as well. \\nIn a study released last month with the Norman Lear Center\\'s \\u200bMedia Impact Project at the University of Southern California, researchers found notable gaps between reality and the ways immigrant stories are portrayed in TV shows.  \\nTheir analysis of 129 immigrant characters in 59 scripted shows from the 2018-2019 TV season found that half the immigrant characters on TV were Latinx, a figure roughly in line with reality. But they also found that proportionally, Middle Eastern immigrants were over-represented on television, making up around 10% of the immigrant characters on TV while comprising just 4% of the US immigrant population. About 12% of immigrants on TV are Asian and Pacific Islander immigrants, but that group is estimated to make up about 26% of the US immigrant population.\\nAnd that season, the study found there were no undocumented Black immigrants on television, even though it\\'s estimated there are around 600,000 living in the United States. \\n\"The storyline right now, in the last couple years, in the minds of Hollywood -- and I think the larger United States -- is that undocumented immigrants equals Latinx,\" Yuen says. \"The reality is there are also Asian and African undocumented migrants who are also vulnerable and need advocacy.\"  \\nCorrecting imbalances like these, Vargas says, is something Define American tries to do in its work. \\n\"We need different stories,\" Vargas says, \"so that we can get to a point where the narrative has been created that this is an issue that impacts all races and ethnicities.\" \\nAnd that, he says, could have an impact far beyond the screen where any show is streaming. \\nWhy the shows we see matter\\nDo the shows we watch on TV influence what we do in real life? \\nFor Vargas and others at Define American, that\\'s a key question. \\nAnd they say a recent survey they conducted as part of their study revealed promising findings. \\n\"What about people who have no contact with immigrants whatsoever?\" Sarah Lowe, Define American\\'s head of research asked at a recent event presenting the study to writers in Hollywood. \"Our findings show that your work can actually make a difference to those people, too.  \\n\"Just like the impact that \\'Will & Grace\\' had with the LGBT movement, for regular viewers of \\'Superstore,\\' Mateo feels like their friend. They feel like they know him, even if they don\\'t know any other immigrants in their daily life.\" \\nAnd the study found that the \"Superstore\" viewers who felt that sense of friendship with Mateo, but had little or no real-life contact with immigrants, were more likely to support an increase in immigrants coming to the U.S.\\nFor Vargas, Define American\\'s recent analysis of the \"Superstore\" character\\'s impact sends an important message. \\n\"The images we see in media are often immigrants crying, immigrants sad, immigrants tragic, as if we have this veil of tragedy all around us, when in reality, the study showed, when you actually present an immigrant in a three-dimensional way as a person, people are moved to action, to tell another friend, to post something on social media,\" he says. \\nAnd that\\'s a big reason Define American will keep pushing behind the scenes. \\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\\'re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\\n (CNN)The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg Friday brought an outpouring of tributes for a freedom fighter whose determination and skill led to landmark changes in the law. It also immediately prompted a partisan battle over her replacement that is likely to supercharge the November election, already considered the most consequential in decades.  \\n\"Having repeatedly beaten cancer, Ginsburg had come to almost seem invincible,\" wrote law professor Mary Ziegler. \"She was a larger than life figure who became a hero to many young women ... Even before joining the Supreme Court, she convinced an all-male Supreme Court that laws enforcing sex stereotypes violated the Constitution -- and demonstrated how those laws harmed men as well as women. Ginsburg helped to make sense of how discrimination against pregnant workers could be pernicious. On the court, Ginsburg offered the clearest and most cogent defense of abortion rights.\" \\nWhen Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, Senate Republicans refused to even hold hearings for the nominee -- Judge Merrick Garland -- submitted by President Barack Obama, insisting that the choice should be deferred until after the presidential election. (\"It\\'s called delay, delay, delay,\" then-candidate Trump counseled Sen. Mitch McConnell from a debate stage.) \\nNow Republicans, led by McConnell, are blowing up their own precedent and saying they would vote on a Trump nominee for Ginsburg\\'s seat in the remaining months of Trump\\'s term. (They are unlikely to be deterred by Ginsburg\\'s hope which she expressed to her granddaughter: \"My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.\")\\n\"Filling the seat in the next 46 days -- or, if Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden wins in November, before January 20, 2021 during the lame-duck portion of Trump\\'s term -- would take American democracy to the breaking point,\" wrote Joshua A. Douglas, who teaches law at the University of Kentucky, the school where McConnell got his law degree. \\n\"Both sides would dig in their heels. The nominee, whoever he or she is, will face mud-slinging and partisan attacks that would make the extremely vitriolic confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh look tame in comparison. At least half of Americans would never view a new justice under these circumstances as legitimate. Ever.\" \\nMcConnell and the Republicans could rethink their stance and wait, Douglas said.  \"Or they can push forward to grab power at all costs, knowing that doing so will damage democracy even further. Senator McConnell: how do you truly wish to be remembered?\" \\nTwo hours and a million miles away\\nIn the American version of the mockumentary series \"The Office,\" the needy, dim lead character Michael Scott, branch manager of Dunder Mifflin\\'s Scranton, Pennsylvania office, displays a fascination with the glitz of New York City. \\nAs played by Steve Carell, Scott is the archetype of cluelessness: \"Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked, but it\\'s not like this compulsive need to be liked, like my need to be praised.\" \\nThe city, two hours away from Scranton by car, is where he goes clubbing, tries (and fails) to impress executives at the fictional paper company\\'s headquarters and crashes corporate parties to gorge on leftover sushi.  \\nIn real life, the distance between Scranton and New York City is suddenly an issue in the race for the White House. Speaking at CNN\\'s drive-in town hall Thursday in that rust-belt city which is his birthplace, Joe Biden framed the campaign as \"between Scranton and Park Avenue.\" Clearly, he would like voters to see the contest as a choice between the authentic son of working-class Pennsylvania and Donald Trump, the privileged son of a multi-millionaire. \\nTrump won the state four years ago by less than a percentage point. And it\\'s expected to be crucial again this year. \"Right now, Pennsylvania looks like the single most important state of the 2020 election,\" wrote Nathaniel Rakich in FiveThirty Eight.\\nTrump also faced voters in Pennsylvania, in this case for a town hall Tuesday at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. College professor Ellesia A. Blaque told him of her lifelong struggle with the disease sarcoidosis and asked how he planned to protect people with pre-existing conditions. \"Rather than allowing me to finish my question -- as I had to respectfully demand him to do  --  or answering my question directly and honestly, the leader of the free world made me feel like an inanimate object,\" Blaque wrote for CNN Opinion. \"He rambled and repeated the same claim that a new health care plan -- better than the Affordable Care Act -- was on its way.\" \\nMore than three-and-a-half years into the administration, there is no new health care plan, and Trump\\'s team is backing a court case that aims to kill Obamacare, which does provide insurance for people with preexisting conditions, wrote John Avlon. \\n\"Trump and his administration just can\\'t stop talking about his nonexistent health care plan. It\\'s going to be great, \\'everybody\\'s going to be taken care of\\'... there will be insurance for everybody ... no one will lose coverage ... \\'there will be no cuts\\' to Medicaid ... and \\'no one will be worse off financially.\\' Those are just some of the repeated promises President Trump and his administration have made about his phantom plan. And like some two-bit con man, he keeps saying it is just about to be unveiled, just a few weeks around the corner ... just you wait.\" \\nIt didn\\'t go well\\nThe town hall format didn\\'t \"go well\" for Trump, wrote conservative commentator Scott Jennings: \"The President had a few decent moments\" but is better off \"in a pugilistic debate with an opponent than he is in addressing individual voters.\" Trump \"often drifts into difficult-to-follow tangents\" and \"tried to have a compassionate moment with the immigrant who recently became an American citizen, but he didn\\'t understand her mom had died of breast cancer and not coronavirus.\"\\nTo Frida Ghitis, Trump \"looked like a fast-talking salesman hawking an inferior product.\" She argued, \"The most obvious conclusion one can reach watching Trump lie about his own record and about what Biden proposes, is that Trump simply does not believe he has a superior plan to offer voters.\" \\nTrump\\'s lukewarm reception in Philadelphia contrasted with the acclaim he receives at his rallies. But that comes at a price for his audience, noted Dean Obeidallah. \"Trump held a rally in Nevada that violated the state\\'s rules on limiting events to 50 people, ignored the state\\'s mask mandate and jammed people on top of each other ... Trump is not just exposing his supporters at the rally to the virus. He\\'s also sending an alarming message to the nation that social distancing mandates can be ignored. This is beyond irresponsible, it borders on sinister given that Trump fully understands how easily transmittable and fatal this virus could be.\" \\nPrepared and angry\\nIn Scranton, \"Biden was prepared and he was angry,\" wrote Democratic strategist Jess McIntosh. \"It was a tautly restrained outrage as he described the failings of President Donald Trump, and he seemed to hold back tears multiple times as he fielded questions from Americans experiencing overwhelming fear and loss amid the deadly coronavirus pandemic.\" \\nBiden demonstrated authenticity and empathy, wrote Alice Stewart, a Republican commentator. That will help him with voters, she argued, but he made mistakes that could cost him in the upcoming debates. Biden retreated from an earlier comment that as president he would impose a national mask mandate and suggested that he would phase out fracking, \"thus transitioning countless Pennsylvania fracking workers out of jobs, with no clear sense of how they could find new ones.\" \\n\"The real test comes when both candidates take to the first debate stage on September 29th,\" Stewart wrote. \"No amount of on-stage social distancing can diminish the impact of that face-to-face contrast of candidates.\"\\nIn a column for the Financial Times, Janan Ganesh laid out an intriguing argument that Biden\\'s flat affect could be an advantage. \"The US has had two consecutive presidents with messianic followings, and it is worse off for the 12-year surge of emotion. No democracy is riper for a period of tepid leadership ... The problem, in other words, is not Mr. Biden\\'s failure to kindle passion in people. It is our psychic need for such a person in the first place. His election might reacquaint the US with politics as it should be and has been: a machine for the arbitration of conflicting claims, and not as the basis of one\\'s whole identity.\"\\nAll the President\\'s Men\\nMichael Caputo, the chief spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, is taking a two-month leave of absence after he shared false conspiracy theories that scientists in the administration are plotting against Trump and that Biden will refuse to concede if Trump wins. \"And when Donald Trump refuses to stand down at the inauguration, the shooting will begin,\" Caputo said in a live video hosted on his Facebook page. \\nThese are not the first inflammatory remarks Caputo has made, noted Michael D\\'Antonio, who called him \"a person perfectly suited for the Trump administration\" and said, \"others in the administration show a similar flair for chaos, ignoring the norms of their offices...\" \\nTrump\\'s attorney general, William Barr, also came under scrutiny this week for controversial comments. Speaking at a Hillsdale College event, Barr said, \"you know, putting a national lockdown, stay at home orders, is like house arrest. Other than slavery, which was a different kind of restraint, this is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history.\"\\nMany were stunned by the remark. Brandon Tensley wrote, \"That Barr painted a few months of being told -- or as it was in many cases, asked -- to stay home during a global pandemic as being even remotely in the same category as the practice of enslavement is ridiculous.\" As he noted, \"For hundreds of years, enslaved Africans were beaten, tortured, raped and treated as property.\"\\nBarr\\'s comments on the election have drawn equally strong criticism. \"By repeating false and misleading statements about the potential for voter fraud and post-election violence, Attorney General William Barr has stepped out of his role as the nation\\'s chief law enforcement officer and marred the 2020 elections,\" wrote election law expert Richard L. Hasen.  \"This parroting of President Donald Trump\\'s unsupported rhetoric is irresponsible and dangerous, turning the job of the Department of Justice as the protector of voting rights on its head.\"\\nMeanwhile, Barr\\'s Justice Department launched a criminal investigation into John Bolton\\'s publication of a book harshly critical of the President. Elie Honig called it \"equal parts futile and dangerous ... the move appears to signal a pernicious effort to use the Justice Department\\'s might to punish perceived political enemies of President Donald Trump.\"\\nFor more on politics:\\nDan Berschinski: I lost my legs fighting for America.

Sutter. \\n\"Fires are tearing across the West. Five tropical storms are spinning in the Atlantic; that\\'s happened only once before. Siberia hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit this year. Death Valley, 130. A report from the World Meteorological Organization said that the five-year period from 2016 to 2020 is expected to be the hottest on record ... We\\'ve warmed the planet about 1.1 Celsius since the Industrial Revolution. We\\'re already living with the dystopian results.\" \\nThe nation\\'s 75-year long relationship with science is undergoing a divorce, wrote Naomi Oreskes, professor of the history of science at Harvard University.\\nThe bargain, struck in 1945, was that \"America would support science\" by funding research \"and in return science would support America, through technical innovation that would better our material conditions and information that would enable us to face life\\'s challenges and solve them.\" But, as news spread of the appointment of a climate science denier to help run NOAA, the agency that provides guidance on climate, that deal is off, Oreskes wrote. \\n\"This administration has repeatedly placed people who have questioned or rejected science in positions of authority throughout the federal service. Vice President Pence rejects evolutionary theory and suggested that smoking doesn\\'t kill, and the President himself, as is well known, has claimed that climate change is a hoax.\"\\nFor an example of what science can achieve, read Sara Seager\\'s account of the work her team did on a sign of potential life on Venus. \\nCollege reopenings\\nCovid-19 is spreading rapidly on reopened college campuses, and there have been at least 88,000 cases, according to a New York Times tally. Dr. Kent Sepkowitz, an infectious disease expert, wrote, \"we find ourselves in a self-inflicted debacle with equally grim options for moving forward and a disengaged federal government. Leaving infected students in colleges will only amplify the infection numbers and...threaten to overwhelm a town; but sending them home also promises a disastrous, if different, ripple of cases and chaos.\"\\n\"In allowing their students to return, leaders, who are the heads of universities where Covid-19 spikes have happened, have failed miserably,\" he argued. \\nThe reopenings happened for two reasons, wrote Lincoln Mitchell. \"Colleges and universities needed to make sure students enrolled for the fall in order to get revenue from housing, food and related fees. That meant they had to persuade families that college would be safe and relatively normal when the new academic year started.\" And in red states, there was political pressure for state universities to align with Republicans\\' push for reopening. \\nLast month the Big Ten conference suspended the football season as a result of the pandemic, noted Christine Brennan in USA Today. Then \"Trump, desperate to win votes in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, told the conference to play football,\" she wrote. \"Originally, the league stood its ground. Rutgers president Jonathan Holloway aptly called it \\'cheap politics.\\' But wouldn\\'t you know, the university presidents ended up following right along, giving Trump exactly what he wanted.\" Wednesday became \"the darkest day in Big Ten sports history, the day the vaunted conference caved. It choked. It got scared.\" \\nDon\\'t miss\\nKelly Hammond: I watched \\'Mulan\\' so you don\\'t have to\\nAllison Hope: A monstrous allegation against ICE can\\'t be ignored\\nJeffrey Sachs: Red and blue states took different paths.

Living through her family\\'s fourth straight fire season in the Bay area, she had already experienced a couple of red flag warnings and so was ready to leave at any moment. When daytime darkness set in a week ago Wednesday, she packed the contents of her refrigerator into a cooler and the family set out for a cabin friends rent out on the eastern side of the Sierra Mountains. But the mountain range was \"completely obscured by falling ash.\"\\n\"My husband and I looked at each other. We could not bring ourselves to drive home. We bought some hot dogs at a forlorn-looking stand in South Lake Tahoe. And then we floored it, further east.\"\\nThe smoke cleared \"somewhere just outside Fallon, Nevada. Emerging outside it was a bit like being in that scene where Dorothy arrives in Oz, and the world flips back to color. I marveled at the reddish sand, at the delicate sage, at the wide cobalt blue of the sky.\"\\nAnd then they kept driving.

(CNN)Gen Z and Millennial organizers are teaming up to build a coalition of progressive young Americans who want to defeat President Donald Trump, protect the ballot box and mobilize on youth issues.\\nThe organizers with Dream Defenders, March For Our Lives, Sunrise Movement and United We Dream Action say that, with just under five weeks until Election Day, the \"Count On Us\" coalition aims to provide young people organizing for racial justice, climate justice, immigrant rights and against guns with a \"political home.\"\\nCollectively, Dream Defenders, March For Our Lives, Sunrise and United We Dream have a combined network of hundreds of thousands of young people. Between now and November 3, Count On Us plans to mobilize their member networks through direct voter contact including phone banks, text banks, social media campaigns and in-person actions.\\nCount On Us will officially launch with an organizing call on Monday and the coalition has built a central landing page, where those who want to join the coalition can pledge.\\nRecognizing the intersectionality of the issues young voters care about as well as the scope of each individual movement involved, organizers say they are joining forces to harness their collective power and make their mark on the 2020 election and beyond. \\n\"It\\'s pretty unique for organizations as large and decentralized as ours to have this really strong tactic going into the election,\" Zina Precht-Rodriguez, the 24-year-old deputy creative director for Sunrise Movement, told CNN.\\nThe alliance also seeks give a place to Gen Z and Millennials who want to get involved but don\\'t know where to start.\\nWhile the organizations involved have worked together at times over the past four years, the launch of Count On Us marks the first time these groups are joining hands as a united front, the organizers said.\\nOrganizers are mobilizing their networks just weeks ahead of Election Day. \\nTrump has suggested that he will not accept the results of the 2020 election on a number of occasions, including during this week\\'s presidential debate. He has also sought to sow doubts about the legitimacy of the 2020 election and refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.\\nWhen asked if he would urge his supporters to stay calm around the time of the election, Trump said at Tuesday\\'s debate, \"I am urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully.\" Also during the debate, Trump refused to say whether he would concede should he lose the election.\\nIn light of Trump\\'s statements, Count On Us is prepared to mobilize what they\\'re calling their \"army of young people.\" They won\\'t poll watch, Precht-Rodriguez said, but will demand that every vote is counted and will be prepared to take action, including taking to the streets.\\n\"If Trump strikes a blow at our democracy, our generation will strike back,\" Count On Us says.\\nStill, Count On Us organizers will continue their fight regardless of who wins in November, organizers told CNN. \\nBiden struggled to gain youth support during the Democratic primary, including from the organizations in the Count On Us coalition. But young people are willing to back Biden in order to defeat Trump, organizers say.\\nHowever, if Biden is elected, Count On Us believes there is still room to push his administration to the left on the issues they care most about.\\nAnd organizers believe that by joining together, they can make more of a difference than they could alone. \\n\"We have reached our most defining moment in electoral politics where our collective ability to push forward the flagship agendas of our generation will be determined not just by how we vote going into November, but how we mobilize the morning after Election Day,\" Precht-Rodriguez said. \"This joint organizing platform will be the universal youth organizing tool of the foreseeable future through the election.\"\\nFor its part, Sunrise Movement, the national youth-led climate justice organization that gained attention for its work in championing the Green New Deal and helped a number of progressive candidates win primary elections this election cycle, is already in talks with the Biden campaign and has worked to push Biden on the issue of climate.\\nAccording to Daud Mumin, 19-year-old student board member with March For Our Lives and an organizer with March For Our Lives\\' Utah chapter, the high youth voter turnout in the 2018 midterms was an \"inspiration\" of the March For Our Lives movement. Since then, \"this idea that the youth are calling BS and enough is enough, inspired so many movements to stand up, be bold and active,\" Mumin told CNN. \\nDream Defenders and United We Dream Action have also worked to mobilize young people in recent years.  \\nDream Defenders, a racial justice organization, was founded in 2012 following the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin and serves as a hub for Black and Brown youth organizers in Florida. \\nAnd United We Dream Action PAC is the electoral arm of United We Dream, a youth-led immigrant network focused on policy solutions for immigrant communities. Cristina Jiménez, the 36-year-old founder of United We Dream, said the organization has grown since its start in 2008, and in that time has fought against the immigration policies of the Trump administration and advocated for an Obama-era program that shields undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children.\\nJiménez, an Ecuadorian immigrant herself, recently gained citizenship and will vote for the first time in the 2020 election. \\n\\n'},\n",

A gfs.bern poll found 63% of respondents opposed the SVP proposal and 35% supported it, suggesting voters want stability at a time of economic uncertainty amid the coronavirus pandemic.\\nNevertheless, the SVP has appealed to those who see their culture at risk from immigration, which by the middle of the century could swell the population to 10 million from 8.6 million now.\\nThe party says jobs are at risk as young foreigners supplant older Swiss, housing gets scarcer and dearer, schools and transport become overcrowded and construction swallows up the landscape.\\n\"Migrants change our culture. Public squares, trains and streets become more unsafe. In addition, practically half of all welfare recipients are foreigners,\" its campaign website says.\\nOpponents warn the plan would rob business of skilled workers -- especially in health care, or for drugmakers like Roche and Novartis -- and torpedo accords that enhance Swiss access to the crucial EU single market.         \\nExpat kickers\\nThe foreign influx is apparent at soccer club FC Uster near Zurich, where kids from immigrant families make up 60% of 13- and 14-year-old players, said club official Ali Özcan, whose own parents migrated from Turkey.\\nOf the 60%, a fifth are from EU and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries.\\n\"Without immigrants, Swiss soccer in general -- professional or amateur, youth or women -- would not be able to exist,\" he told Reuters, citing arrivals from the Balkans, Africa, and Middle East.\\nHe said European expatriates tended to prioritize children\\'s intellectual development and often planned to return home after Swiss stays.\\nBetween the start of free movement in 2002 and 2019, the population rose by 1.3 million.

       "  'body': 'Washington (CNN)Customs and Border Protection encountered more than 458,000 people in fiscal year 2020, marking a sharp decline from 2019 but not straying far from previous years despite the Trump administration\\'s increasingly aggressive immigration enforcement posture.\\nThe number of encounters -- meaning people illegally crossing the border or presenting at a port of entry -- at the US-Mexico border has been viewed as a metric of this administration\\'s immigration policies.\\nThe Trump administration has relied on deterring migrants from coming to the southern border through controversial policies like the \"zero tolerance\" policy that led to the separation of thousands of families and returning asylum seekers to Mexico while they await immigration court proceedings in the US. \\nThe administration has also put measures in place that allow for the swift removal of migrants encountered at the border, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.  \\nYet despite these measures, hundreds of thousands of migrants, many of them families and children, journeyed to the southern border last year and continue to come though there\\'s been a shift in demographic makeup. Single adult males from Mexico accounted for 56% of migrants encountered this year, according to CBP. \\nActing CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan defended the administration\\'s actions during a Wednesday news conference, crediting them for helping reduce the flow of children and families, which made up the majority of apprehensions last year. \\n\"This administration has been overwhelmingly successful at shutting down many of the loopholes being exploited, which Congress has refused to address again and again,\" Morgan said. \"Make no mistake: We\\'re in a better position right now because of this administration\\'s immigration policies and initiatives.\" \\nAccording to newly released data, Border Patrol arrested 400,651 people who crossed the border illegally between last October, the start of the fiscal year, to September, a drop from fiscal year 2019, when 851,508 people were arrested at the US-Mexico border. But this year\\'s Border Patrol stats are slightly higher from fiscal year 2018, when 396,579 people were arrested and just under fiscal year 2017\\'s 303,916. \\nMorgan has previously dismissed the gradual uptick in recent months, arguing that as a result of a public health law, implemented in light of the coronavirus pandemic, the administration is able to swiftly remove migrants who are apprehended -- a move that\\'s been challenged in court and criticized by immigrant advocates and lawmakers.\\nUnder those pandemic-related restrictions, however, the number of people repeatedly trying to enter the US has crept to 37% between March, when the public health order was implemented, and September. In comparison, the recidivism rate, as it\\'s known, was 7% last year.\\n\"Our recidivism has gone up dramatically, but it\\'s very geographically specific,\" said Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott during Wednesday\\'s news conference. \"We\\'re returning people very, very quickly, but our ability and willingness, if you will, to prosecute people, to have a consequence to the illegal activity of crossing the border, has been reduced.\"\\nUnder the public health order, the administration is removing 90% of those encountered in less than two hours, Morgan said Wednesday. He credited the order with helping drive down arrests, but public health experts have slammed the administration\\'s use of the law, arguing that there\\'s \"no public health rationale for denying admission to individuals based on legal status.\"\\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Kate Schmier is a writer and editor whose fiction and nonfiction have been featured by NPR, Lilith Magazine, Alma, and others. She holds an MFA in writing from Sarah Lawrence College. The views expressed here are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.\\n (CNN)When my husband Uri was finally sworn in as a US citizen in August, our announcement to loved ones was met with both excitement and trepidation. \"I hope our country changes so that we can one day deserve a citizen like him,\" one friend responded. \"I wish we were in a better position to welcome him,\" said another. \\nI understood their reservations: Uri has become an American amidst a pandemic that threatens our nation\\'s future, an administration that has repeatedly shown its hostility to immigrants, and a precipitous deterioration of our country\\'s global image. A recent Pew Research Center survey showed that international public opinion of the US is at a historic low.\\nEach day seems to bring fresh warnings that our democracy is in peril. And yet, when Uri took his oath of allegiance -- wearing a mask and a face shield in a sweltering Manhattan courthouse -- I found myself celebrating. Near the end of Uri\\'s ceremony, the judge reminded everyone in the courtroom that we are a nation of immigrants and thanked them for choosing the United States. I am forever grateful that Uri made this choice -- and that so many others have, too. \\nThroughout our history, immigrants\\' bravery, ingenuity and determination have enabled our country to progress towards its highest ideals and survive its darkest hours. By removing roadblocks for new citizens, especially around voting, we can mobilize individuals who could set our nation on a path to renewal.\\nI\\'m thrilled that Uri now has the chance to make his voice heard -- and relieved by what his naturalization means for our family. For the majority of our 11 years together, I felt a looming sense of uncertainty and impermanence. Uri, a jazz saxophonist from Israel, told me soon after we met that there were no guarantees he would be able to stay.\\nSecuring his artist\\'s visa -- officially titled \"Alien of Extraordinary Ability\" -- required massive amounts of paperwork, significant legal fees and many months of waiting and restricted travel. At one point, a snag in the application process kept him from leaving the country for almost two years. Even after the issue was resolved, I was on edge whenever he toured internationally. Every year, when his visa was up for renewal, I held my breath -- afraid that this time, the bureaucrats reviewing his papers would decide to separate us.\\nOur marriage did not put an end to the uncertainty or to my anxiety. As a US-born citizen, I was able to sponsor Uri\\'s green card application. Almost a year after our wedding, we were summoned to the New York Field Office of US Citizenship and Immigration Services for the grueling green card interview -- in which a couple must answer an immigration officer\\'s scrutinizing questions to prove their relationship isn\\'t a fraud. \\nWe were counting on Uri\\'s lawyer to ensure it went smoothly, but he showed up nearly an hour late for our scheduled meeting. I wonder if the lawyer cared what his tardiness that morning might have cost us.\\nI thought of these uneasy moments when Uri finally got the call. The one telling him that, after 17 years in this country, he could stay for good. By that point, he had already passed his citizenship exam, but the last step -- the oath ceremony -- had been delayed since March due to Covid-19. In August, he and about 40 other immigrants from Ghana, Germany, China, and elsewhere were sworn in, standing six feet apart, by a judge who joined virtually.\\nFamily members weren\\'t allowed to attend, but Uri texted me a photo of himself holding his naturalization certificate in front of the New York County Supreme Court Building. For the first time, I was able to envision our long-term future in America. \\nThe judge who administered Uri\\'s citizenship oath said something that helped me understand the broader significance of the moment: \"This country is not perfect, but we have the power to change it.\" It reminded me of new Americans\\' potential to propel our nation forward. A recent report found that in many battleground states, the number of new Americans who are now eligible to vote is larger than the margin of victory in the 2016 elections -- suggesting that newly naturalized citizens could strongly influence the outcome in November. \\nThis is cause for optimism and hope, but time is running out. Voter registration deadlines are this week for more than a dozen states, passed last weekend in two others, and are fast approaching elsewhere. US Citizenship and Immigration Services has an urgent responsibility to expedite the naturalization process for pending cases.\\nWhile naturalizations tend to increase in an election year, hundreds of thousands may be disenfranchised due to the agency\\'s backlog of delayed oath ceremonies, civics tests and interviews. And despite President Donald Trump\\'s photo op with new citizens during the Republican National Convention, his new executive orders have further restricted immigration. \\nWe must also remove barriers that prevent far too many naturalized citizens from fully participating in our democracy. Historically, immigrant voters have had lower turnout rates in presidential general elections than US-born voters. In 2016, according to Pew Research Center, 62% of US-born eligible voters cast a vote -- compared with 54% of foreign-born voters.\\nOne major obstacle is a linguistic one: While Uri was fortunate to come to this country with English proficiency, the Pew report found that nearly four-in-ten immigrant eligible voters say they speak English \"less than very well,\" which hinders civic engagement. Limited education and access to technology also create disenfranchisement, particularly in marginalized communities. Multi-pronged, multi-language outreach efforts targeting new citizens should become an even more significant part of \"get out the vote\" tactics, especially in swing states.\\nThe power to change our country is not just about voting. Indeed, the United States has always relied on immigrants for new ideas and perspectives that drive innovation in the arts, sciences, and industry. I\\'ve seen this play out in my own life -- from my ancestors who fled the pogroms of Eastern Europe and built thriving businesses in the Rust Belt to Uri\\'s community of talented musicians from across the globe.\\nI recall one memorable night, early in our relationship, when I accompanied Uri to a percussionist friend\\'s birthday party. In a crowded, dimly lit basement apartment in Harlem, immigrant musicians sang \"Happy Birthday\" in at least 10 different languages. I remember thinking this was the America I wanted to live in -- one in which people from disparate backgrounds could come together for a common purpose. By empowering newcomers, we have the opportunity to make this vision a reality and save our nation\\'s future.\\n\\n'},\n",

They are the magic,\" Cassidy said. \"To see their faces all lit up when they know that they can use a power drill, it gives me a high.

I grew up not having any self-confidence in myself. I had some, but not a lot, and I didn\\'t want any little girl to grow up feeling that way.\"\\nThe Trinidadian was not exposed to the trades until high school. \\n\"I literally got kicked out of typing class because I struggled with typing and was put into the technical drawing class,\" Cassidy said with a laugh. So that was my precursor for plumbing without even knowing it.\"\\nBut when her great-grandmother passed, she couldn\\'t afford to attend a university. So, she opted for a free education and applied to trade school.\\n\"I chose plumbing like this—I said \\'plumbing, you get wet, and electrical, you get shocked.

       "  'body': ' (CNN)During a recent visit to Miami\\'s Eighth Street, or Calle Ocho as locals call it, it wasn\\'t hard to overhear older Cuban Americans talking politics at neighborhood haunts. Seated with friends at Café Versailles, an iconic restaurant on the main thoroughfare of the Little Havana neighborhood, Cuban-born María Eneida Castellanos was clear about her choice for the next US president.\\n\"I\\'m a trompeta,\" Castellanos said, using the Spanish word for trumpet. It\\'s common lingo among local Hispanic voters who plan to cast their ballot for US President Donald Trump in the November 3 election. \"That\\'s why we\\'re here,\" Castellanos added, referring to her life in the US. \"I\\'m Cuban. We\\'re Cuban,\" she said. But in the local community, \"We\\'re American.\"\\nThere\\'s a reason Castellanos moved to the US from her native Cuba decades ago. She believes the US can protect her from the pitfalls of Cuba\\'s troubled economic and political past—and that Trump\\'s stance on issues like crime and trade will help. \\nOther first-generation Cuban Americans share this sentiment. \"I come from a socialist country where people live very badly because of socialism.\" said Dayalis Gallardo, a Cuban-born immigrant walking along Calle Ocho. \"That\\'s my biggest fear and that\\'s why I would never vote for [former vice president Joe] Biden.\"\\nRoughly 32 million Hispanics are expected to be eligible to vote in this year\\'s US presidential election. That will make them the largest minority group in US presidential election history. But while Hispanic voters tend to skew more Democratic than Republican, there are signs that Trump is gaining ground over Biden, his Democratic rival, among Hispanic voters in key states like Florida.\\nTrump has a lot to gain from the Cuban American vote in Florida, where the group makes up about a third of the state\\'s Hispanic vote, they turn out to vote in higher numbers, and they lean more Republican than Hispanics nationally. That\\'s partly to do with the geopolitical forces that drove many Cuban Americans to flee to the US decades ago, an experience that shaped their worldview. But there are also signs that Trump may capture more of these voters this year. His hard stance on relations with Cuba and Venezuela\\'s embattled socialist leader Nicolás Maduro appeals to voters who still bristle at memories of Fidel Castro\\'s communist regime.\\nCuban Americans who fled from Castro and communism tend to care more about Trump\\'s stance on economic and social issues than, for instance, his derogatory comments about immigrants, says Eduardo Gamarra, a professor of international relations at Florida International University. This is also the case for more recent arrivals like Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, who suffered under authoritarian and socialist regimes. \\nFor Alejandro Delgado, a Cuban-American voter who landed in south Florida after fleeing the Castro regime, the issue driving his vote is not the economy, Covid-19, or even immigration. It\\'s the perception that Biden\\'s vision amounts to communism. \"We fled communism in Cuba. We don\\'t want to deal with that here,\" Delgado said. \"If we want to save ourselves from socialism and communism, we have to vote for Trump.\"\\nMemories of lawlessness and corruption in their home countries make Trump\\'s \"law and order\" message appealing to voters concerned about about US protests over police brutality and racial injustice. \"Cubans, Venezuelans, and other Latin Americans, including Colombians, have come to believe that Biden is going to destroy the police\" and \"create another Cuba or Venezuela,\" says Gamarra.\\nIn his research on Latin American demographics, Gamarra says he\\'s found that \"when you give people the choice of law and order and more freedom, people always vote for law and order.\"  Republicans have linked the idea of disorder on the streets to communism, he adds. These voters feel that \"if Biden wins, the country will turn communist.\"\\nA hard line on Cuba and Venezuela \\nThe same logic applies to Trump\\'s harder line toward the Cuban and Venezuelan governments. His tightening restrictions on the two regimes appeal to Cuban-American voters wary of political turmoil.\\nTrump\\'s latest round of sanctions on Cuba, announced in September, ban US citizens from buying Cuban cigars and rum and staying in government-owned hotels on the communist-run island. But in light of pandemic-related travel restrictions and a ban on most Americans traveling to Cuba, they may have little immediate effect.\\nThe harder line \"hasn\\'t had an impact on Cuba, and the same [is true of] Venezuela,\" Gamarra says.\\nThe Trump administration has also expanded sanctions against the government of Maduro, who secured another six-year term as Venezuela\\'s president last year, in a process widely viewed as a sham. Trump has been vocal in his support of Venezuelans against Maduro\\'s rule.\\n\"The tragedy in Venezuela is a reminder that socialism and communism bring misery and heartache everywhere they\\'re tried,\"  Trump said at a Hispanic summit in March, adding later that \"America stands with the suffering people of Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua and their righteous struggle for liberty.\"\\nIn reality, US policy toward Venezuela has changed little since the George W. Bush administration, Gamarra says. And that isn\\'t likely to change after the election. \"If Biden wins, or if Trump wins, there won\\'t be a significant change in the US Venezuela policy,\" Gamarra adds.\\nWhat Trump\\'s policies have done is stoke anti-American rhetoric from the Cuban and Venezuelan regimes, which may help his efforts to woo Hispanic voters. In September, Venezuela\\'s Maduro, who has blamed the US government for domestic problems like rampant inflation and food shortages, told a group of government loyalists that Trump\\'s latest round of US sanctions \"chop off [most] financing to our country\" and deprive it of \"the oxygen it requires to obtain food, medicine, supplies, [replacement] parts, and essential raw materials that are essential for economic activity.\" \\nThe conspiracy factor\\nAlarming messages circulating on WhatsApp and Facebook play into these fears among Hispanic voters who fled communist or socialist rule.  \\nWhile the origins of these messages aren\\'t known, there are concerns that they could have more sway with voters than paid ads on traditional media, since they circulate among trusted friends and relatives.\\n\"Kennedy betrayed us in Bay of Pigs [Invasion in Cuba]. Are you still going to vote Democrat?\" a billboard asks voters in Miami. \"Trump: anti-science and anti-Dreamers,\" says a picture that has been circulating on Facebook. \"Under Trump, we drink chlorine. Under Biden, we will drink cafecito,\" reads an image posted on Twitter. \\n\"We come from political cultures where conspiracies have always been normal things,\" Bolivian-born professor Gamarra says. Cuba\\'s Castro, Chile\\'s Augusto Pinochet, and Guatemala\\'s Jacobo Arbenz are just a few examples of Latin American leaders whose power hinged on conspiracies. \\nThose memories of hazy information in politics breed a sense that \"there\\'s truth in every intrigue,\" says Gamarra. But they could cut both ways with skittish Hispanic voters. In conversations along Miami\\'s Calle Ocho, Emilio Álvarez was one of few who identified as undecided, but leans Democrat. The Cuban-American immigrant said he was bothered by Trump\\'s loose relationship to truth.\\nIt\\'s hard to believe that Trump has respect for the country\\'s highest office, said Álvarez, when he \"says things that don\\'t have anything to do with facts.\"\\nWritten and reported by Rafael Romo in Atlanta.

       "  'body': 'Lake Charles, Louisiana (CNN)As Hurricane Delta approaches, residents of a precarious mobile home neighborhood in southwest Lake Charles, Louisiana, packed their bags and evacuated the city following a mandatory order. Delta is scheduled to hit this area late Friday afternoon as a Category 3 hurricane, with sustained winds of around 115 miles per hour.\\nJust six weeks ago, Category 4 Hurricane Laura ripped through this Lake Charles neighborhood. In southwestern Louisiana, some 10,000 homes were damaged, according to Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards.\\nMarianne Rivera, a leader in the Hispanic community, says that \"FEMA helped us a lot, and the Red Cross has been on the ground trying to help those who lost their homes to (Hurricane Laura) find hotels, funds, and food.\"\\nBut the streets are still littered with debris -- remains of metal, wood with rusty nails and furniture, completely destroyed artifacts and household items. Several mobile homes, CNN could observe, are still without power or water. Some of them have lost their roof or walls, while others have completely collapsed. Appliances and mattresses lay strewn across the lawn.\\nIn 2019, the Lake Charles Hispanic community accounted for 3.7% of the local population, according to the Government Census Bureau. However, it is only a rough estimate, and according to Marianne Rivera, in recent years there has been an influx of immigrants from Central America.\\nIn this community, situated just minutes away from the regional airport, many of the residents are painters, construction workers, or carpenters. They told CNN the pandemic has heavily impacted their work opportunities, and various residents told us they could barely make ends meet.\\nLuís Guzman is from Honduras and has lived in the United States for a year and a half painting homes. He lives with his sister, Maria Guzman and her two sons. They are headed West to Houston to protect themselves, leaving their belongings behind. \"We have to follow the rules they are sharing in the news. What God does no one can contradict, we have to evacuate.\"\\nDown the road, Daniel García and his partner were packing up their car as well. García moved to Lake Charles just five days ago from San Antonio, Texas, where he hasn\\'t been able to work since June. Meanwhile in Louisiana, damaged homes need repairing and García heard they pay around $18 an hour to make drywall. \\nThese hopes of employment, however, have been crushed by the evacuation order in place in Lake Charles. García says \"he doesn\\'t feel safe,\" so he and his roommates are headed for Aspen, Colorado, hoping to turn this difficult situation into an opportunity to get away.\\nDelta is forecast to make landfall along the Gulf Coast as a Category 3 hurricane beginning on Friday afternoon and lasting late into the evening, and it could follow a very similar path to Hurricane Laura\\'s. \\nAs many of the local residents pack their cars and head to Houston, Texas, Imar Sandoval, an immigrant, says that he is not going anywhere and will stay at home. \"Nothing is going to happen to me,\" he says very sure of himself. Their main concern is that all the debris still left on the side of the road will cause further damage.\\nIt has been a difficult year for the low-income Hispanic community in Lake Charles. Many are evacuating hoping this experience won\\'t be the same as Hurricane Laura; that they will be able return to more than scraps of what used to be their home.\\nCNN\\'s anchor and senior correspondent Jose Manuel Rodriguez contributed to this report. \\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump\\'s refusal to accept a new plan for a virtual second presidential debate reflects how such an event would likely limit his capacity to dominate the stage and trample the rules in a bid to launch a comeback against Democrat Joe Biden.\\nThe decision by the Commission on Presidential Debates to hold a remote encounter next week follows Trump\\'s diagnosis with Covid-19 after the White House became a raging hotspot and is an ironic consequence of the President\\'s failure to protect himself and those around him amid a pandemic that has killed more than 210,000 Americans.\\nThe apparent loss of the next face-to-face encounter with Biden likely makes it even more difficult for the President to use the second debate to engineer a turnaround in a race that increasingly appears to be trending in the direction of the former vice president who is widening his lead in the polls.\\n\"I heard that the Commission a little while ago changed the debate style and that is not acceptable to us,\" Trump said in an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business.\\n\"I beat him easily in the first debate ... I\\'m not going to do a virtual debate. I\\'m not going to waste my time on a virtual debate -- that\\'s not what debating is all about, you sit behind a computer and do a debate -- it\\'s ridiculous. And then they cut you off whenever they want.\"\\nThe last part of that sentence hints at Trump\\'s biggest objection to the new format -- he would be less able to impose his personality on the showdown. In the first debate last week, the President constantly interrupted his opponent and the moderator Chris Wallace. Although his behavior appears to have alienated many viewers, he seems convinced that his characteristic rule breaking helped him win the debate.\\nFor the Biden campaign, which is up by double digits in the most recent national polls, the new arrangement removes another risky moment as the days remaining in the campaign dwindle and as more Americans cast early and absentee ballots. It also gives the former vice president\\'s team an opening to say that the change in the format of the debate is all Trump\\'s fault given his casual attitude to social distancing.\\nTrump\\'s campaign manager Bill Stepien blasted the decision on the debate and said Trump would do a rally instead.\\n\"For the swamp creatures at the Presidential Debate Commission to now rush to Joe Biden\\'s defense by unilaterally canceling an in-person debate is pathetic. That\\'s not what debates are about or how they\\'re done,\" Stepien said in a statement.\\nThursday\\'s decision by the Commission, in retrospect, makes it even more significant that the single vice presidential debate on Wednesday night between Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Kamala Harris of California did not appear to measurably change the shape of the race.\\nPence did his best to recast the reality of Donald Trump\\'s presidency, but Sen. Kamala Harris, the Democratic pick for his job, refused to let him spin away the nation\\'s current dire plight amid the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\"The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country,\" the California senator said in her first answer in Salt Lake City, pinning Pence with the deaths of more than 210,000 Americans from Covid-19.\\n\"They knew what was happening, and they didn\\'t tell you,\" Harris said. \"They knew and they covered it up. ... The President said you\\'re on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask, you\\'re on the other side of his ledger if you don\\'t. And in spite of all of that, today they still don\\'t have a plan.\"\\nHarris -- from a multi-racial, immigrant family from the liberal West Coast -- and Pence -- the white, male conservative, evangelical product of the heartland -- were an apt representation of the two Americas disputing the election and whose divergent paths and belief systems are at the root of the country\\'s current political estrangement. \\nWhile both Pence and Harris refused to say whether they had discussed the ticklish topic of succession with their septuagenarian ticket-toppers, given their assured performances at the debate, it would not be a stretch to envision either of them in the Oval Office.\\nThe debate might actually have been the most normal moment of a campaign warped by a once-in-a-century pandemic, virtual conventions, darkened rallies and constant eruptions by a volcanic commander-in-chief. \\nIt unfolded against a backdrop of more than 7.5 million coronavirus infections, millions of Americans out of work and with many schools kids and students stuck at home in unsatisfactory online lessons. \\nAnd in a moment that summed up the White House\\'s repeated flouting of public health recommendations, second lady Karen Pence removed her face mask as she stood on stage with her husband following the event in an apparent infringement of agreed-upon rules. Harris\\' husband, Douglas Emhoff, kept his mask on when he went on stage to congratulate his wife.\\nBack in Washington, aides who wanted to talk to a sickened President who disdains masks and social distancing had to don face-coverings and surgical gowns.\\nTrue to form, Trump couldn\\'t let Pence have his one night in the spotlight all to himself, releasing a video hours before his running mate went on stage that proclaimed his own Covid-19 infection was a \"blessing from God\" while again downplaying the disease and over-hyping the availability of therapies and coming vaccines.\\nHis intervention encapsulated Pence\\'s burden: trying to impose a sheen of success on a presidency that while wildly popular with the conservative base is seen by a majority of voters as unmoored amid a clutch of crises over public health, the economy and race less than four weeks from Election Day.\\n\\'Excuse me, Mr. Vice President, I\\'m speaking\\'\\n \\nBoth Pence and Harris did what conventional, polished politicians do -- they landed blows, probed one another\\'s weaknesses and artfully dodged the questions for which they did not have a politically safe answer. It was largely a civil affair after last week\\'s meltdown in front of millions of viewers by an over-torqued Trump. \\nHarris several times was forced to stifle Pence, who frequently spoke past his time, with the words, \"Excuse me, Mr. Vice President, I\\'m speaking\" -- a retort weighted by the gender and racial dimensions given her historic status vying to become the first Black and South Asian American female vice president, and her nomination has already made history. But the interruptions went both ways, and there was no need to drown out Pence, as smooth and priestly as ever, with \"the shut up man!\" admonition employed by Democratic nominee Joe Biden last week.\\nPence, who as the head of the coronavirus task force shares blame for the chaotic response to the crisis, tried as he often does to project optimism about the pandemic. But the fact he\\'s been doing so for months tended to undercut his effectiveness. In a brazen moment, he accused Harris of politicizing hoped-for vaccines and disrespecting the sacrifices of Americans during a dark time.\\n\"Stop playing politics with people\\'s lives,\" Pence warned Harris in an ironic assault since Trump has consistently put his own political needs ahead of a fact-based approach to an emergency that has devastated normal life.\\nThe vice president fell back on familiar and fact-twisting arguments that Trump had saved millions of lives, misrepresenting his China travel ban and hyping the prospect of vaccines that experts say may get approved this year but will not be available to most Americans until well into 2021. Often, Pence delivered the same misinformation as the President about the pandemic, even if his courtly manner did not make the transgressions seem so flagrant.\\nHarris repeatedly brought the argument back to an indictment of the Trump-Pence response to the virus. The two plexiglass screens between the candidates were a constant reminder of the issue that the vice president could not escape.\\nBoth candidates can walk away satisfied\\n \\nMore Americans said Harris did the best job in the vice presidential debate Wednesday night, according to a CNN Instant Poll of registered voters who watched. About 6-in-10 (59%) said Harris won, while 38% said Pence had the better night -- but the results aren\\'t likely to change the trajectory of the race.\\nPence accomplished what he came to do -- defending Trump -- and was most effective in cross-examining Harris on whether Democrats would try to increase the size of the Supreme Court bench to subvert Trump\\'s conservative majority. He was also strong on the economy. He took aim at Biden when Harris attacked the President\\'s trade wars, calling the top Democrat on the ticket a \"cheerleader for Communist China through several decades.\"\\nHarris didn\\'t do much to clear up Biden\\'s climate change policy as Republicans accuse him of embracing the liberal Green New Deal approach they claim will kill the energy industry and jobs. And the California senator demanded the White House let voters decide on the destiny of the Supreme Court, pushing back against Trump\\'s nomination of conservative favorite Judge Amy Coney Barrett to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\\nHarris also made hay over The New York Times report about Trump\\'s repeated failure to pay federal taxes and contribution of only $750 in 2016 and 2017 -- demanding to know to whom the commander in chief owed $400 million. Pence repeated the President\\'s denials and claimed -- not that convincingly -- that his boss had paid \"millions of dollars\" in taxes. \\nIn a worrying sign, in an election that could tear at constitutional norms, Pence joined his boss in refusing to guarantee a peaceful transfer of power. And he parroted conservative media talking points pushing back against the truth that Trump declined to disavow white supremacists during last week\\'s fiery first debate with Biden.\\nCrucially for Democrats, Harris made no errors likely to slow Biden\\'s momentum -- as their campaign piles up double digit leads in national polls. She showed empathy for the bereaved amid the pandemic and for the millions who have lost their jobs. She only slipped into her more familiar prosecutorial mode once in the evening -- on the issue of criminal justice -- a key Trump theme.\\nConservatives likely thought Pence did great and find the prospect of a Harris vice presidency horrifying. The same is undoubtedly true the other way around. Liberals could find much to embrace in Harris\\' performance while viewing Pence as on a different ideological planet.\\nBut given that Trump\\'s campaign desperately needs a reset, and a ray of hope going into the final three weeks of the campaign with the convalescing President on the sidelines, it was ultimately probably a more satisfactory night for the Democratic campaign. And while they often provide entertaining moments, vice presidential debates don\\'t decide elections, a truism that is even more appropriate this year with the most tumultuous presidency in generations is on the ballot.\\nUltimately, in years to come, history might remember the night not for the jousting of two capable performers but for the single fly that settled on Pence\\'s white hair at one point, spawning scores of instant social media memes.\\n\\n'},\n",

View more opinion articles on CNN.\\n (CNN)Donald Trump\\'s town hall with ABC News did not go well, although I give him credit for agreeing to a road game in a hostile gym. The President had a few decent moments in Philadelphia Tuesday, but the event showed he is simply better in a pugilistic debate with an opponent than he is in addressing individual voters in a \"townhall\" format.\\n \\nNot that the negative interactions were all his fault. This was billed as a conversation with \"uncommitted\" voters, which is, charitably, baloney. Most  of the questions were hostile, and several of the questioners quite clearly have no intention whatsoever of voting for Trump. \\nIt actually speaks to a larger question about the American electorate -- is there really anyone uncommitted at this point? There is no ambivalence about Trump. You love him or you hate him. And some people who love him are going to vote against him, because they are exhausted. And some people who hate him are going to vote for him because they see his opposition as unhinged and ridiculous.\\n \\nTrump also had to fight off relentless badgering from ABC\\'s chief anchor George Stephanopoulos. This is Stephanopoulos\\' job, I guess, and Trump often says things that are so ridiculous that he invites the badgering. But this format was supposed to be about Trump and the voters and it was frequently about Trump and the anchor. This show should\\'ve been unmoderated.\\n \\nIf there are any undecided voters out there, they probably exist in the suburbs or more broadly in America\\'s middle class. These are people who value their job and understand the economy in a very personal way. And a good number of them voted for Trump in 2016, migrated away from the GOP in 2018, and are trying to figure out what to do now. To bring them back, Trump should view these kinds of events -- including the upcoming debates with Democratic nominee Joe Biden -- through a narrow lens, aiming his answers squarely at that group.\\n \\nTrump did that a few times tonight, talking about the undeniable economic success he was having before the pandemic and public safety issues. But the President often drifts into difficult-to-follow tangents that wouldn\\'t be appealing to that group, underscoring the challenges he has with college educated suburban voters. He tried to have a compassionate moment with the immigrant who recently became an American citizen, but he didn\\'t understand her mom had died of breast cancer and not coronavirus.\\n \\nOn the issues, Trump probably had his best political moment when talking about bringing the troops home from the Middle East. And he definitively denied the anonymously sourced story in The Atlantic that claimed he said awful things about American soldiers wounded or killed in battle. He also had a nice retort that will appeal to his kind of voters when he said: \"It\\'s a big battlefield and I have a lot of forces against me. Sometimes you don\\'t have time to be totally, as you would say presidential -- you have to get things done.\" This message will drive the elites crazy and thrill those who hate the elites immensely.\\n \\nOverall, I am not sure this format was helpful to Trump. I understand why he did it -- his campaign was asking for additional debates earlier in the process, after all -- but given that the questions and moderator were overly hostile, Trump wasn\\'t able to find much traction.\\n \\nHe\\'ll get another chance on September 29 at the first debate against Biden in a format that should set up better for him. Trump needs a good national performance as millions of voters are receiving their ballots soon, and the pressure on him in two weeks will be enormous.\\n\\n'},\n",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\\n (CNN)On Monday, with the US on the verge of reaching the solemn number of 200,000 dead from Covid-19, Donald Trump appeared on Fox News where the topic of the virus was raised. Did Trump express sympathy for the heartbreaking losses caused to families across the nation from this deadly pandemic? Nope, instead he patted himself on the back for doing what he called \"a phenomenal job\" in handling Covid-19, giving himself an \"A+.\" The only criticism Trump would offer was regarding the public relations for the virus, saying in that area, \"I give myself a D.\" He blamed the low grade on \"fake news.\" \\nOn Wednesday, the number of Americans who have perished from this virus reached 200,000, and they all deserve a better response from the President. They are not a PR crisis to be managed — they were someone\\'s loved one. They were beloved mothers and fathers, sons and daughters. They were grandparents who taught their grandchildren about life, teachers who made students smarter, coaches who pushed their players to be better, deli owners who remained open so neighborhoods would have food during lockdowns. They were doctors, nurses, police officers and others who worked while many of us were able to stay safe in our homes. They were the apple of someone\\'s eye, a soul mate, a reason for living. The people who died were not only like us, they often were the best of us. \\nI knew three people who died from the virus, which is not surprising since I live in New York City, which at one point was the epicenter of this deadly pandemic. One of the three was Hal Willner, the son of Holocaust survivors who was a funny, offbeat music producer — responsible for the music you heard in Saturday Night Live sketches. Willner was a former co-worker from my days on the production staff of SNL. \\nAnother was a childhood friend from Paramus, New Jersey, named James \"Jimmie\" LaBarbiera, who died in April of the virus. Jimmie wasn\\'t a PR crisis that Trump mismanaged, he was the father of two teenage sons, someone who always had a smile on his face and fanatically cheered for the New York Mets.\\nThe stories of those taken by Covid could fill books — and should. Kimberley Chavez Lopez Byrd, a beloved teacher in Arizona who, despite following safety protocols at her school, contracted the virus and died. Abdelfattah Abdrabbo, a Palestinian immigrant who came to America 45 years ago in pursuit of the American dream, achieving that by opening a small import/export store in Detroit along with raising six children who went on to become a doctor and a teacher, among other professions. Hockey coach Tyler Amburgey from the Dallas, Texas, area died in August, at 29, leaving behind his wife and young daughter. \\nOthers offered us hope, like the Rev. Vickey Gibbs of Houston, Texas, a tireless activist for social and racial justice, and many entertained us through the years like singer-songwriter John Prine to 60\\'s singer Trini Lopez. \\nSome have heartbreakingly lost their children to Covid, despite Trump falsely claiming in August that children are \"almost immune\" to Covid-19. \\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children\\'s Hospital Association, 500,000 US children have been diagnosed with the virus.\\nThen there are those who risked their lives to protect us such as the more than 100 police officers taken by the virus, according to data from the Officer Down Memorial Page, a non-profit organization that tracks law enforcement fatalities in the line of duty. In fact, more police officers have died from the virus than from any other cause while being on the job. Tragically, a database created by Kaiser Health News and The Guardian found that at least 900 frontline health care workers died from this virus. As the study found, many of these deaths were preventable if there had been better preparation by the federal government in terms of protective equipment and testing resources. \\nDespite the deaths that spanned this nation, the effect has not been equal as the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on people of color. Black Americans have died at a rate 2.4 times higher than Whites, while Hispanics and Native Americans are dying at about 1.5 times the rate of Whites, according to the COVID Tracking Project. \\nReading the stories of those lost to Covid-19 will move most to tears, as it did to CNN\\'s Brianna Keilar on Monday while reporting on a North Carolina couple married for over 50 years who died in the hospital just minutes apart while holding hands. \\nWhen you hear the statistics about Covid-19 deaths, please think of the human story behind each name. Think of the 200,000 plus families mourning the loss of a beloved relative, the young children left without a father or mother, the family dinner table missing a place setting, the unfinished lives and dreams left unfulfilled. \\nThese people are not statistics nor are they a mishandled public relations crisis. They are our fellow Americans who deserve to be remembered and cherished.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)Immigrants in US custody faced widespread failures in medical care, including some issues that resulted in death, according to a new congressional investigation released Thursday. \\nAt US Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities operated by for-profit contractors, detainees \"often do not receive critical treatment or face delays,\" the inquiry found. Additionally, the review found that many of the for-profit facilities lack sufficient medical staff and failed to provide necessary care for chronic medical conditions.\\nIn some cases, there were delays in emergency care, staffing shortages and poor sanitation, according to the investigation led by House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney of New York and subcommitee chairman Jamie Raskin of Maryland. \\nLast summer, the House Oversight committee announced it was investigating the Trump administration\\'s \"rapidly increasing\" use of for-profit contractors to detain immigrants after reports of health and safety violations.\\nFor its investigation, the committee requested documents from ICE and two for-profit contractors, CoreCivic and GEO Group. The two companies operate facilities with more than 80% of all people in ICE detention. Committee staff also inspected 22 Department of Homeland Security facilities in six states, including ICE detention centers, as well as Customs and Border Protection facilities. \\nIssues of inadequate care at ICE facilities have been an ongoing issue. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security inspector general found expired food and dilapidated bathrooms during unannounced visits to four immigrant detention facilities in 2018.\\nThe findings of the new investigation come a week after a whistleblower who previously worked at an ICE facility in Georgia detailed a high rate of hysterectomies and alleged medical neglect in a complaint filed to the DHS inspector general.\\nKen Cuccinelli, the DHS senior official performing the duties of the deputy secretary, called the allegations \"shocking\" on Thursday, saying he had dispatched a team from outside of ICE to investigate. \\nDuring the course of the congressional investigation, detainees reported that when facility personnel did not deem medical issues to be emergencies, they did not take them seriously. \"Individuals suffering from migraine headaches, hernias, and high blood pressure reported that their conditions went untreated,\" the report reads. \\nFor example, a detainee in Texas reportedly remained in medical quarantine for nine days with facial swelling before he was diagnosed with mumps. He permanently lost hearing in one ear.\\nICE Director of Public Affairs Stacey Daniels told CNN in a statement that the agency is \"fully committed to the health and safety of those in our care and will review the committee\\'s report.\"\\n\"However, it is clear this one-sided review of our facilities was done to tarnish our agency\\'s reputation, as opposed to actually reviewing the care detainees receive while in our custody. Improvements to civil detention are based on concrete recommendations from the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) and an aggressive inspections program, which includes formal facility inspections, independent third-party compliance reviews, daily on-site compliance reviews and targeted site visits,\" Daniels added.  \\nThe committee detailed the deaths of several detainees in custody. In 2018, Huy Chi Tran, 47, died of a sudden cardiac arrest after eight days in detention. He was placed in solitary confinement at CoreCivic\\'s Eloy Detention Center in Arizona. According to the report, a guard failed to monitor him and then falsified logs. \\nCoreCivic does not provide medical or mental health services at Eloy Detention Center, according to Amanda Gilchrist, the company\\'s director of public affairs. ICE is \"solely responsible for contracting, staffing and oversight of any medical and mental health services provided at Eloy,\" she said. \\n\"CoreCivic is committed to the safety and health of every individual in our care. We don\\'t provide the health care in the majority of our immigration facilities. In most cases, comprehensive medical, mental health and dental care is provided for by the ICE Health Services Corps,\" said CoreCivic Director of Public Affairs Amanda Gilchrist in a statement. \\n\"Where we do provide care, our clinics are staffed with licensed, credentialed doctors, nurses and mental health professionals who contractually meet the highest standards of care,\" she added in part. \\nGEO Group spokesperson Christopher V. Ferreira said in a statement, \"We strongly reject these baseless allegations, which are part of another politically driven report that ignores more than three decades of providing high-quality services to those in our care.\"\\nFerreira said the GEO Group\\'s Adelanto ICE Processing Center -- one of the facilities in the report -- \"provides safe and humane residential care and high quality 24/7 medical services.\" \\nIn May 2017 after being detained for nine days at the California facility, Vicente Caceres-Maradiaga, 46, died of an enlarged heart and liver. At least five other immigrants have died at Adelanto since 2012, according to the investigation. \\n\"Internal documents obtained by the Committee show that the issues that led to Mr. Caceres-Maradiaga\\'s death were systemic at Adelanto,\" the report reads. \\nAccording to GEO Group, there are approximately 79 health services professionals at the center. In 2019, the health services team provided more than 54,000 medical encounters, Ferreira said.\\n\"For more than thirty years, we have provided high-quality services to the federal government under both Democrat and Republican administrations and we have always complied with the Performance-Based National Detention Standards, which were first established under President Barack Obama\\'s administration. Furthermore, the Center is highly rated by independent accreditation entities, including the American Correctional Association and the National Commission on Correctional Health Care,\" he added.\\nThe ongoing coronavirus pandemic has \"compounded\" the problems in the facilities, according to the report, which found that detainees face deficient sanitation practices and poor handling of infectious diseases.\\nAt least four detainees have died after contracting the coronavirus in ICE custody and more than 6,000 detainees and ICE staff have contracted the virus as of September 23.\\nThis story has been updated with additional details from the report and reaction. \\n\\n'},\n",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion on CNN.\\n (CNN)I used to think the pressure going into Tuesday\\'s presidential debate would be squarely on Joe Biden.\\n \\nWith President Donald Trump and his amen corner at Fox News and various portals of the right so persistently attacking Biden\\'s stamina and mental acuity, I anticipated that this could be the most crucial test for the former vice president.\\n \\nWhile that still is true, Trump and his apparatchiks have so lowered the bar with their cartoon caricatures of Biden that they have done him an enormous favor. Biden doesn\\'t need a perfect performance Tuesday night. He just needs a reasonably coherent and energetic one. \\n \\nTrump, on the other hand, enters this debate as an embattled incumbent, nine points behind in a race in which Americans already have begun voting. The clock is ticking, and this debate is the President\\'s best -- if not his last -- chance to change the structure of a race that has been locked in against him throughout the year.\\n \\nIn belittling Biden, Trump has complicated his own debate prospects by promoting a presumption that he will mop the floor with \"Sleepy Joe.\" For the President, a close battle won\\'t do. He needs a knockout.\\n \\nWithout question, the stakes are high for both men, but the pressure to deliver weighs more heavily on Trump.\\n \\nThere are two approaches the President can take to shake up the race. One is out of character. The other is familiar.\\n \\nThe first would be to turn in a modulated and thoughtful performance that would cause the relatively small number of voters still up for grabs to look at him anew. \\n \\nTrump will certainly try to change minds by stressing -- and, most likely, greatly inflating -- his accomplishments. While Biden leads in most categories, Trump retains a polling edge on who is best equipped to lead the economy. He might try to burnish this advantage.\\n \\nBut Trump\\'s approval rating has been mired in the low- to mid-40s throughout his presidency, and his mishandling of the raging pandemic that has claimed more than 200,000 American lives hangs from his neck like the anchor from USS John S. McCain. \\n \\nVoters were more willing before the virus to credit Trump with a strong economy and forgive his daily tweetstorms and squabbles. Now the cost of the President\\'s character flaws has been made clear by his chaotic response to a virus he would sooner deny than confront.\\n \\nAnd the idea that for 90 minutes Trump can contain his instincts to strike out wildly seems wildly improbable.\\n \\nSo assume that Trump\\'s mission Tuesday night will be more to sow doubt about Biden than to remove doubts about himself. \\n \\nDon\\'t expect a lot of new material. Trump is basically a worn-out stand-up act. The lines are familiar.\\n \\nHe will try to bait the former vice president by calling him soft on China, and an aged and addled tool of a mob-coddling, police-hating, immigrant-loving left. Though he is the incumbent, Trump will try to portray himself as a force for change and Biden as an exemplar of a failed status quo in Washington.\\n \\nHe may try to goad and unsettle Biden by talking about the business dealings of his son Hunter. (It\\'s noteworthy that a report issued by GOP-led Senate committees last week, for the obvious purpose of helping Trump, failed to support charges of corruption against Joe Biden.)\\n \\nFor Biden, the considerable challenge will be to avoid chasing Trump down every rabbit hole or the urge to correct every falsehood.\\n \\nInstead, he should want to force Trump to respond and defend.\\n \\nThe case against the incumbent is well known and widely accepted. Biden simply needs to hammer it and offer a vision of a better path forward.\\n \\nExpect him to return again and again to the President\\'s mishandling of Covid-19 and efforts to scuttle the Affordable Care Act, with its protections for people with pre-existing conditions. This will take on added meaning after Trump\\'s nomination to the Supreme Court of Amy Coney Barrett, who has expressed skepticism about the constitutionality of the ACA and may become a vote to dismantle it in a case currently before the court.\\n \\nHaving lost ground with college-educated white voters, Trump\\'s hope for victory is to crank up his base among non-college whites who delivered overwhelming margins for him over Hillary Clinton in 2016. But Biden, an Irish-Catholic man from working-class Scranton, Pennsylvania, has proven himself a culturally inconvenient target and polls suggest he could capture a significantly higher portion of that vote than did Clinton. \\n \\nIn recent weeks, Biden has intensified a class-based argument against Trump. \"I view this campaign as a campaign between Scranton and Park Avenue,\" Biden said at a recent CNN Town Hall. Expect more of that in the debate, with a populist critique of Trump\\'s record and an emphasis on economic plans Biden says will boost working-class Americans.\\n \\nIn a perfect world, Biden would, at times, turn Trump\\'s negative energy against him and, rather than engaging, address the country: \"This is exactly what we\\'ve seen for the past four years, and we have paid a terrible price for it. The question you have to ask yourselves is, do you believe the next four would be different or better? That he will change? That he will grow?\"\\n \\nHe may come armed with kiss-off lines in response to Trump\\'s attacks, similar to one a smiling Ronald Reagan deployed against President Jimmy Carter in their one 1980 debate: \"There you go again.\"\\n \\nBut, as we saw in his last primary debate against Bernie Sanders, Biden\\'s debate engine can run hot and, challenged by Trump, he may not want to give the President any quarter.\\n \\nIf what results is a verbal brawl from start to finish, that might suit Biden just fine.\\n \\nElevated moments in contrast to Trump could pay big dividends and win critical acclaim. But feisty exchanges from the start to finish would definitively answer questions about energy and stamina and remove what is perhaps the only barrier left for Biden to clear.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'New York (CNN Business)Jennifer Lorincz loved her job as a sales manager for a fabric company, even though it meant traveling across six states from New York to Indiana. But in August, she joined what has become the fastest growing part of the labor market — workers who have permanently lost their job.\\nThere are now 4.5 million such people looking for work. That includes 742,000 who have had temporary jobs come to an end, and 3.8 million who have lost permanent jobs. The number of permanent job losers among the unemployed has more than doubled in the last six months, the fastest pace of increase on record.\\nIt had already been a tough five months for Lorincz before she lost the job she had for three years. Her employer cut her pay in March as business ground to a halt in the pandemic. Then in May, she was brought back at full pay after the company got federal money to help keep its workers on payroll.\\nBut that money ran out after eight weeks, and she was laid off again. Her employer told her they planned to bring her back at the start of September, but two weeks before, she found out her job was gone for good.\\n\"I absolutely thought I was going back to work September 1,\" she said. For Lorincz, like millions of others, a temporary layoff became permanent. She\\'s not hopeful about finding anything new anytime soon. \\n\"It\\'s been a devastating experience,\" she said. \\nThe good news for the labor market is millions of workers who were laid off have returned to work in the past five months, enough to lift the total number of US jobs every month since the spike of job losses that occurred in April. \\nBut as Lorincz\\'s case shows, not all of those on temporary layoff can count on being called back to work. So the overall gain in jobs from the recall of workers on temporary layoff is masking a growing number of permanent job losses, causing lasting damage to job market.\\nPermanent job losses rising rapidly, and will keep climbing\\nThe number of unemployed who have lost a permanent job, or had a temporary job has come to an end, has soared in the past seven months, from 1.9 million in February, to 4.5 million in September.\\nThat means the percentage rise over a six-month period has been the fastest on record going back more than 50 years. The doubling of those permanent job losses in such a short time frame has never happened before, not even during the Great Recession. \\nAnd permanent job losses are poised to keep climbing. \\nAmerican  (AAL)and United Airline  (UAL)cut 32,000 jobs on Thursday alone. Disney (DIS) has announced plans to permanently cut 28,000 workers who has been on temporary furlough before now at its US theme parks. JCPenney (JCP) plans to cut 15,000 jobs as its closes 149 stores ahead of the holiday shopping season as part of its plan to emerge from bankruptcy. On Sunday, Cineworld, the owner of Regal Cinemas, said it may have to close more than 500 US theaters indefinitely. \\nNone of those permanent job losses are reflected in the most recent numbers from the Labor Department.\\nLorincz, said she had been out of work before, when a startup she worked for went out of business. But she never been a scared about being able to find something new.\\n\"I\\'m picking up odd jobs here and there, I\\'m Door Dashing, and doing everything to cover expenses,\" she said. \"I don\\'t know what I\\'d be doing if I was trying to support a family. I\\'m without insurance during a pandemic, which is terrifying.\"\\nThe number of unemployed who are out of work due to the end of temporary jobs has also been rising rapidly over the last seven months, increasing by nearly 100,000. Many of those workers were used to moving from one job to another and now haven\\'t been able to find the next job as normal.\\nJustin Doan, 29, has worked as a tour manager, production manager and audio engineer in the live music industry since finishing college. He\\'s made good money in the job he always dreamed of having. But he hasn\\'t worked at all since March 13, when the tour he was on abruptly shut down.\\n\"Everything is halted. We didn\\'t realize at the time that it would be shut for this long,\" he said. \"The thought was we would reschedule in May. That never happened.\"\\nLooking at changing careers\\nDoan has been burning through his savings, and said he is now worried that live music won\\'t be returning until late next year. That might mean he has to change careers. But he said this is a very difficult time to think about such a huge shift.  \\n\"There are millions of people out there who are also unemployed,\" he said. \"Many may have more experience on paper than I have.\" \\nMost of those who now permanently out of work have lost long-term jobs, many that they held for much of their career. \\nJuan Jose Martinez Camacho, 59, has been a cook for 30 years, since he was asked to fill in one day when he was working as a dishwasher in a restaurant. \\nHe has worked as a cook at the Crowne Plaza in Redondo Beach, California, for 22 years. When he was laid off on March 23, he was thinking it would be only two or three months before things got back to normal. But late last month he was notified he had permanently lost the job, which paid $22 an hour. He has been looking for other cooking jobs without any luck.\\n\"It hurts me to think that if things don\\'t get better I might have to do other types of work,\" said Martinez-Camacho, a Mexican immigrant who spoke through a translator. \"It\\'s what I love to do.\"\\nAnn, a designer of luggage and backpacks, who asked to use a pseudonym because of the terms of her severance agreement, is also worried about not being able to find a new job in her field. Travel demand has cratered, which means few people are in need of luggage. And with millions of students shifting to remote learning, there\\'s a dearth in demand for backpacks. \\nShe lost her job in August via a Zoom meeting. \\nAnn said she was also lost a job during the Great Recession, but she is far more worried this time.\\n\"Honestly I don\\'t know what I\\'m going to do,\" she said. \"This is much scarier. In terms of looking for jobs — you can\\'t even meet with people face to face. It\\'s horrifying.\"\\nAnn said she\\'s also nervous about losing a job this time because she\\'s 53, 11 years older than the last time she was out of work. \\n\"It\\'s just a very competitive landscape,\" she said. And while her husband is still working, \"this is no longer a one-income economy. You have to have two incomes.\"\\n-— CNN\\'s Tami Luhby contributed to this story.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Allison Hope is a writer whose work has been featured by The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, Slate and elsewhere. The views expressed here are the author\\'s. Read more opinion on CNN.\\n (CNN)In 1961, famed civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer\\'s uterus was removed by a White doctor without her consent while she was undergoing surgery to remove a tumor. Sterilization of Black women was so common at the time that the practice was dubbed a \"Mississippi appendectomy.\"\\nIn 2018, a county hospital in Los Angeles apologized for 200 sterilizations of women in the 1960s and 1970s who delivered babies and who, because of language and cultural barriers, may not have understood what was happening or have given consent. According to Alexandra Minna Stern, a professor at the University of Michigan, eugenics sterilization laws on the books in many states until the 1970s resulted in about 60,000 people being sterilized in procedures that \"we would qualify today as being compulsory, forced, involuntary, and under the justifications that the people who were being sterilized were unfit to reproduce.\" \\nThese stories are not from \"The Handmaid\\'s Tale.\" They really happened. And according to a former health care worker at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility, these historical events have sprung back horrifically into the present. This whistleblower alleges that unnecessary sterilization procedures, some without consent, are happening the United States of America in the year 2020.     \\nDawn Wooten, a licensed practical care nurse who worked at ICE-run Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla, Georgia, blew the whistle, stating in a complaint to the Department of Homeland Security inspector general that while some patients may have needed surgery, \"everybody\\'s uterus cannot be that bad.\" Wooten\\'s complaint also alleges that the facility failed to take necessary steps to prevent the spread of Covid- 19.   \\nThe complaint doesn\\'t disclose the name of the doctor or say when or how many women were allegedly coerced into receiving the procedure. ICE said it doesn\\'t comment on matters presented to the inspector general.   \\n\"ICE takes all allegations seriously and defers to the (Office of the Inspector General) regarding any potential investigation and/or results. That said, in general, anonymous, unproven allegations, made without any fact-checkable specifics, should be treated with the appropriate skepticism they deserve,\" the agency said. \\nDr. Ada Rivera, medical director of the ICE Health Service Corps, cited agency data that since 2018, only two individuals at the detention center have been referred to certified, credentialed medical professionals for hysterectomies at gynecological and obstetric health care facilities. Rivera said in a statement, \"Based on their evaluations, these specialists recommended hysterectomies. These recommendations were reviewed by the facility clinical authority and approved.\"   \\nWooten\\'s allegations are similar to others that have surfaced at ICE facilities, according to lawyers, court documents and other whistleblowers. Some of these allegations include a lack of social distancing, transfers of detainees despite heightened risk of virus transmission and spread, and attempts to treat Covid-19 symptoms with over-the-counter cold medication. \\nHouse Homeland Security Committee chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi was emphatic: \"The allegations put forth in this whistleblower complaint point to an alarming pattern of unsafe conditions and a lack of oversight at privately-run ICE facilities,\" he said in a statement, calling the allegations of hysterectomies being performed on women without consent \"incredibly disturbing.\"   \\nIf these allegations are true, we are financing both medical neglect during a global pandemic and paying for so-called medical professionals to perform potentially unnecessary and non-consensual invasive surgeries that remove a woman\\'s ability to reproduce. Democratic leaders have called for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct an immediate and thorough investigation, but as it stands, a veil of protection and secrecy around DHS and federally-run ICE facilities practices remains. It desperately needs to be lifted.    \\n\"When I met all these women who had had surgeries, I thought this was like an experimental concentration camp. It was like they\\'re experimenting with our bodies,\" said one immigrant who spoke anonymously with Project South, a social justice organization. \\nAccording to the complaint filed by Wooten, who is represented by the Government Accountability Project and Project South, she spoke with multiple detained women who didn\\'t fully understand why they had had the procedures performed on them.  \\nWooten described one patient who said that while \"she was not all the way out under anesthesia\" that she heard the doctor say to a nurse that he removed the wrong ovary during surgery. Because her remaining ovary still had a cyst, it had to be removed as well \"and she wound up with a total hysterectomy,\" Wooten alleged in her complaint. \"She still wanted children.\"  \\nStill, we should harbor no fantasies about the United States. We must recognize that the shocking story of women allegedly subjected to unauthorized surgery by a prison gynecologist is not as much of an aberration as any of us might hope. The United States of America has a long, documented history of using human bodies — especially the bodies of Black, brown and indigenous women — as science experiments. We must not turn away from that history as we look to the future to demand accountability and transparency from DHS. \\nIn fact, eugenics sterilization laws were on the books in more than half of the states at the turn of the 20th century, which resulted in the forced mass sterilization of tens of thousands of so-called \"feeble-minded\" and \"mentally defective\" Americans. These laws later served as a case study for Nazi Germany. There are many things Americans want to be known for globally; brutal human rights violations — or at least more than we must reckon with already, given our history — are hopefully not among them. \\nHow do we lay our heads on our pillows each night with these allegations burning inside of us? And if we try to take comfort in the thought that we are somehow safe, that horrible things will surely only ever happen to other people, people not like us, then we haven\\'t tuned into history closely enough. Any government willing and able to take the uteruses, the civil rights, the dignity away from one human, is a government that already has the tools, the practices and the runway to do it to anyone else. And those who run the government, including the President — ultimately responsible for the actions of agencies like ICE — need to be held accountable. \\nThere is only one festering, tweeting part of America\\'s body that needs to be removed, and there is an opportunity to do so this November.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': \"Jeffrey D. Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN. \\n (CNN)America has been coming apart at the seams, with Democrats and Republicans increasingly unable of communicating with one another. Red states and blue states, as decided in the 2016 election, have confronted each other in incomprehension, and are leading very different lives with very different economic conditions. Reuniting America requires a forward-looking path of sustainable development that benefits all regions, including the states that have been hard hit by the long-term decline in manufacturing jobs. \\n \\nThe geographical divide pitting the blue ocean coasts against the red interior is partly culture, to be sure. Social liberals are heavily concentrated on the coasts, while social conservatives, especially White Evangelical Protestants, are heavily concentrated in the South and Midwest. Yet the blue-red divide has a crucial socioeconomic dimension as well.   \\n \\nThough Democrats had been considered the party of the working class since the New Deal, they carried the richest counties and lost in many of the poorest in 2016. Understanding that fact is key not only for the Democrats to retake the White House but for the country as a whole to reunite in a common purpose. As candidate, Joe Biden seems to be conveying the right messages. \\n \\nDemocrats have become the party of social progressives, African Americans and other minorities, environmentalists, and younger voters, as well as the party of those with bachelor's degrees or higher. Republicans, meanwhile, became the party of social conservatives, especially Evangelicals, and increasingly of White working-class and older voters. \\n \\nRapid technological changes have pulled blue and red states apart economically, notably most advanced in the blue states. Democratic Party strongholds on the two coasts are heavily oriented towards the high-tech service sectors, while staunch Republican Party regions in the interior are heavily concentrated in the goods sectors, such as manufacturing and fossil fuels. \\n \\nThe economies driving blue states are based heavily on professional sectors that draw on a workforce with bachelor's degrees or higher. Meanwhile, the goods-producing sectors of red states, including agriculture and forestry, mining, construction, and manufacturing, draw on a workforce with much lower rates of college completion.\\n \\nWhen comparing election outcomes with data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, Clinton carried 17 of the 20 states with relatively large service sectors, while Trump carried 27 of the 30 states with relatively large goods sectors. The 15 states with the highest proportion of employment in mining, logging, construction, and manufacturing all went for Trump, while 9 of the 10 states with the lowest proportion of workers in goods-producing sectors went for Clinton. Clinton carried the states with high-tech services. All 15 states with the highest proportion of adults with advanced degrees (post-Bachelor's) went for Clinton, while 24 of the 25 states with the lowest proportion of advanced degrees went for Trump. \\n \\nThirteen of the 15 richest states (ranked by median household income) voted for Clinton, while 22 of the poorest 25 states voted for Trump. These high incomes reflect the earnings of the high-tech professional sectors.\\n \\nIn 1979, employment in manufacturing peaked at 19 million jobs, but declined to around 12 million by the time of the 2016 election. By 2016, many industrial workers felt that the Democrats were no longer representing their interests.\\n \\nTrump swooped in on these states during his first campaign to wrest many of them from Democrats, charging them with ignoring their job plight. He claimed that the jobs had been lost to China, Mexico, and immigrants, and that he would restore the jobs through protectionism and anti-immigrant policies. These arguments were grossly exaggerated and ignored the forces of automation, which has led to an increase in output of goods despite fewer workers, thanks to robotics and other technological advances. \\n \\nVoters in red states that both produce and use fossil fuels more heavily have been wary of plans to decarbonize the economy. Trump prevailed with an aggressive though utterly false and blatantly racist narrative. He told red-state voters that China and Mexico had stolen their jobs and that he would return them. He blamed immigrants for many of the red-state ills. He promised to resurrect the red-states' fossil-fuel industries. \\n \\nIn fact, Trump's remedies have been so much hocus-pocus. The number of those employed in manufacturing in 2019 remained well below 2008 numbers. The number of manufacturing jobs in August 2020 was 247,000 less than at the start of his term in January 2017. He did not and could not bring jobs back from China since most of the job decline in industry reflected automation not trade, and since even jobs squeezed out of China by US tariffs will simply shift jobs to Vietnam or other low-income but highly productive countries.\\n \\nMoreover, Trump has not and could not resurrect the coal, oil and gas industries. His promises to do so are recklessly blind to the world's shift away from fossil fuels and towards green energy due both to the climate crisis and also to falling costs of renewables. Jobs in mining and oil and gas extraction are down by 30,000 since Trump took office and will fall further as America's declining and money-losing fossil-fuel production is replaced by wind and solar power. The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production stock index is down 51.5% over the past year, while the Clean Energy S&P is up 50.7% over the same period. \\n \\nTrump did not and could not create decent red-state jobs by clamping down on immigration, since immigrants were never the cause of red-state job woes to begin with.\\n \\nHe also promised a boom in construction jobs building new infrastructure across the US, but he failed to do so, as he lacked any serious vision of what the country needs.        \\n \\nDemocrats now have the opportunity to reunite the nation by creating jobs across all regions.  They should offer an industrial plan to build the next generation of electric vehicles, smart grids, advanced batteries, and green fuels (such as hydrogen produced with renewable energy) -- all of which would create new jobs throughout the industrial heartland. \\n \\nThe Democrats can win over the natural-resource states by playing to their great strengths: massive low-cost renewable energy (especially wind and solar power) and new mining resources for advanced batteries, electric vehicles, wind turbines, and other parts of the new industrial economy. \\n \\nThe Democrats should also lead on the long-delayed modernization of infrastructure: interstate transmission lines to carry renewable energy; buildings retrofitted for electrification and energy efficiency; charging stations and other facilities for electric vehicles; transmission pipelines for hydrogen and other green fuels; and a 5G network for advanced digital services. \\nIn sum, the path to sustainable investment is the path to a reunified America, with all parts of the nation contributing to the nation's recovery. \\n\\n\"},\n",

       "  'body': '\\nIn a small town in northern Germany, the local yacht club isn\\'t what it used to be. Many of the members -- mostly middle-aged men -- have been sucked into the conspiracy theories of the QAnon movement: that the coronavirus is a hoax perpetrated by secret elites and that President Donald Trump will save the world from the machinations of the \"deep state.\"\\nThey\\'ve also embraced other themes that circulate among QAnon followers in Germany: displaying the flag of the pre-war German Reich, which is popular among neo-Nazis, and the false belief that German Chancellor Angela Merkel used to be a spy for the East German security service and will soon be arrested. \\nThese conspiracy theories and many more, which have spread across social media rapidly this year, led Facebook to take drastic action to curb the impact of QAnon on its platforms. On Tuesday the social media giant announced it would \"remove any Facebook Pages, Groups and Instagram accounts representing QAnon, even if they contain no violent content.\"\\nFacebook said it is \"removing content accordingly, but this work will take time and need to continue in the coming days and weeks.\"\\nAs part of a wide-ranging investigation into the dramatic growth of QAnon accounts outside the United States, CNN recently sent Facebook details of dozens of groups and pages that embraced QAnon conspiracy theories. Facebook said it would investigate them and had begun removing some pages.   \\nAmong the pages that may be removed in the coming weeks are several of the German yacht club\\'s members, which CNN is not publicizing, and which had devolved into a cocktail of QAnon falsehoods.\\nThe son of one member, who asked not to be named to protect his family from further media attention, said his father had begun by believing the coronavirus pandemic was a plot and might \"spiral down into even weirder conspiracy theories.\"\\nHe told CNN that, at one point, yacht club members raised the flag of the neo-Nazi Reichsburger movement. Reichsburger followers deny the Holocaust happened and have picked up on a number of QAnon themes. They joined a Berlin protest against lockdowns in August, which was also attended by some of the yacht club\\'s members.  \\nQAnon goes global\\nQAnon began life as a uniquely American phenomenon. In October 2017, an anonymous user describing themselves as Q (which is a level of US security clearance) posted on the message board 4chan. These messages, often cryptic riddles, would become known as \"Q drops.\" They featured conspiracy theories about the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election and much else. \\nTheir popularity has grown ever since. \\nCNN has explored hundreds of social media accounts in tracking the explosive growth of QAnon internationally, a virtual cult that has created a dilemma for platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Among those examined were nearly 180 Facebook groups and pages that espoused QAnon themes, all of them from outside the US and the majority in Europe or Latin America. Within Europe, Germany, Italy, France and the United Kingdom had the highest engagement with QAnon.  \\nCombined, the QAnon-related Facebook pages and groups reviewed by CNN logged a total of at least 12.8 million interactions between the beginning of the year and the last week of September. \\nAlmost all that activity happened since March, when the coronavirus pandemic spread quickly across Europe.  \\nFacebook began tackling QAnon in August, when it embarked on a process of removing accounts that discussed potential violence. \\nIt said Tuesday: \"We removed over 1,500 Pages and Groups for QAnon containing discussions of potential violence and over 6,500 Pages and Groups tied to more than 300 Militarized Social Movements. But we believe these efforts need to be strengthened when addressing QAnon.\"\\nAmong the falsehoods published and discussed in these groups and on these pages are claims that secret cabals are involved in widespread trafficking and torture of children, that 5G mobile phone masts cause cancer and that political elites are using the pandemic to monitor and control people. \\nFor example, in Britain a Facebook group dedicated to stopping the rollout of 5G had almost 60,000 members before the social network deleted the account in April. \\nThese disparate themes swirl together with anti-Semitic tropes and fascist insignia. Besides the Reichsflag, the flag of the 1930s British Union of Fascists appeared at one London event that attracted QAnon followers. Many QAnon followers and far-right groups are united in the belief that an end-of-times confrontation between forces of evil and good is at hand.\\u202f\\nThe pandemic boost\\nCNN\\'s tracking of QAnon engagement through CrowdTangle -- a Facebook tool that shows likes and shares for content across social media -- showed a remarkable increase as the coronavirus pandemic took hold across both Europe and Latin America. \\nThis echoes research by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. It found that from October 2017 to June 2020, 69,475,451 million tweets, 487,310 Facebook posts and 281,554 Instagram posts mentioned QAnon-related hashtags and phrases. And it said: \"a clear trend exists showing a notable increase in conversation volumes coinciding with periods when lockdowns were issued in response to the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020.\" \\nIn July, internet trust tool NewsGuard identified \"448,760 followers or members\" of European QAnon groups in social media it analyzed. That\\'s an indication of the scale of Facebook\\'s task in removing QAnon content.\\nMatthias Poehlmann, a cult specialist with a German evangelical church, said people \"search for conspiracy theories that are supposed to offer clarity about the secret plan of the \\'deep state\\' because the coronavirus pandemic has caused a feeling in many of a loss of control.\"\\n\"Many also believe that they are being left behind, that they don\\'t have a say in political decisions. And as is usually the case with conspiracy theories, they also react to a longing for simple answers,\" Poehlmann said.\\nA survey by polling group Kieskompas of 8,000 adults in the Netherlands in August found that 10% believed one or more coronavirus-related conspiracy theories and nearly 6% thought a Covid-19 vaccine would include an implant so their movements can be tracked. \\nIn Germany dozens of small Telegram groups of self-described \"Corona rebels\" have sprung up. The number of followers of Qlobal Change -- one of the main QAnon Telegram channels in Germany -- rose from 20,000 before the coronavirus crisis to more than 120,000 in September, according to research by Josef Holnburger, a data scientist at the University of Hamburg. \\nIt is a splintered, chaotic landscape.\\u202fQAnon has no structure, no leadership. It is bound together by a few hashtags -- such as #SaveTheChildren and #Wherewegoonewegoall, also known as #WWG1WGA\\u202f \\n\"Everyone can contribute to this story with his or her own conspiracy theory ... it is almost like a building kit where you can link one conspiracy theory to the next,\" Poehlmann said.\\nThe rabbit hole\\nViktor\\u202f -- who didn\\'t want to use his real name because he\\'s concerned about harassment -- was an early convert to the conspiracy theories that gave birth to QAnon. A Russian in his mid-twenties living in Germany, he stumbled across what became known as PizzaGate, which baselessly claimed that a Washington, DC pizzeria was a hub for child trafficking masterminded by Hillary Clinton. \\n\"I don\\'t know how I got hooked,\" he told CNN from Munich, where he is a software developer. The PizzaGate conspiracy led him down one rabbit hole after another, feeding an antipathy towards feminist, liberal and LGBTQ activists, he said.\\nViktor says that as he became more embroiled with QAnon so he became angrier \\u202f-- \"ready to explode ... it poisons day-to-day life to the point you can no longer maintain healthy relationships.\"\\n\"Conspiracy replaces your personality. It\\'s like a parasite on top of you, you talk about conspiracy, not building personal connections,\" he told CNN. \\nAn American woman living in Ireland who asked not to be named for fear of further disrupting her family, contacted CNN about her 38-year-old son, who lives in the UK and became absorbed in QAnon theories. She had turned to a Reddit message board called QAnon Casualties for support.\\n\"My son is a brilliant man who has become an idiot,\" she told CNN, adding that he cut her off from her grandchildren. When she contracted Covid-19, he dismissed it as a cold.\\nShe thinks the \"lockdown and work from home\" fed into his behavior. \"It does feel like they\\'ve been abducted somehow. It\\'s a cult.\"\\nAnti-Semitic traffic\\nNever far away from QAnon pages are anti-Semitic conspiracies and tropes. Billionaire philanthropist George Soros and the Rothschild dynasty are frequent targets. QAnon followers sometimes refer to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a fake document from the early 20th century purporting to be a record of secret meetings in which Jews plotted to control the world. \\nIn the UK, the Community Security Trust, a charity that tackles anti-Semitism, says conspiracy theories featured in 218 anti-Semitic incidents recorded between January and July of this year. One-hundred and seventy spoke of Jewish power and influence in global politics, a common theme among QAnon followers. \\nDave Rich, director of policy at the Trust, told CNN: \"The anti-Semitism isn\\'t necessarily explicit in a lot of these sort of Q discourses, and it isn\\'t necessarily what drives it, but all the tropes are there if you want to see them.\"\\nRuben Gerczikow, vice president of the European Union of Jewish Students, said he has noticed that online \"sometimes people are referring that I am part of this global conspiracy.\"\\n\"I am the perfect enemy basically,\" he told CNN. Gerczikow said his organization had warned the Jewish community in Germany to stay away from protests against lockdown restrictions. \\nTaking to the streets\\nAs lockdowns have eased, these tropes and many other QAnon theories have appeared on the streets -- especially in Germany, Italy and the UK -- in a different and more disturbing guise.  \\nNearly 40,000 people attended a Berlin rally at the end of August to protest against lockdown and mask mandates but also the \"deep\\u202fstate.\" The event was notable for the number of far-right groups that joined in (like the Reichsburger) and for its adulation of President Trump.\\nIn a video message, Austrian far-right activist Martin Sellner told the protesters they could mobilize a \"broad, patriotic mass\" to fight the \"grand strategy\" of global elites. Members of the Reichsburger tried to force their way into the German parliament, a symbolic act meant to recall the Nazis\\' burning of the Reichstag.\\nPoehlmann says the Berlin protest was \"the call for the strong man who is fighting and working against the establishment. Trump is idolized as the savior, more or less, who is leading the battle against the deep state.\"\\nThe rally made waves online. One German QAnon-related page, \"Freiheit ist das Recht, anderen zu sagen, was sie nicht hören wollen\" (\"Freedom is the right to tell others what they don\\'t want to hear\"), amassed 1.3 million views of Facebook Lives around the protest. And a banner asking Trump to \"make Germany great again\" was liked more than 16,400 times on Instagram. \\nLast weekend, another rally took place in Konstanz, southern Germany, attended by several thousand people.\\nOne of the speakers at the event, Traugott Ickeroth, told CNN: \"I read the Q drops regularly, this Q is very intelligent and it seems that he knows the future, he\\'s very exact.\" \\nAnother QAnon sympathizer at the rally, who did not want to give his name, said he was \"not the typical\" Q follower. \"There are some good things they\\'re posting, many things that came out as true, but I wouldn\\'t say I\\'m a blind Q follower,\" he told CNN. \"Many things have been right that they\\'ve said ... several things they\\'ve predicted came true.\"\\nSome observers believe fringe far-right groups are grafting themselves onto QAnon groups to give themselves a greater profile. \\nThe Jewish Students Union in Germany says the anti-lockdown protests have become an \"oasis of well-being\" for neo-Nazis, anti-Semites and other far-right groups. According to Josef\\u202f Holnburger at the University of Hamburg, Reichsburger\\'s following grew from 10,000 to about 100,000 subscribers across online platforms in the first four months of 2020 alone.\\nIn Italy, the far-right\\u202f Forza Nuova has latched onto QAnon\\'s momentum, working with the cult\\'s followers to organize a protest in Rome in August. Some figures in the right-wing party Lega, like Patrizia Rametta in Sicily, have embraced QAnon ideas and revived the Protocols of Zion conspiracy.\\nBut it\\'s not solely the right that has propagated themes popular among QAnon followers. Sara Cunial, an independent member of the Italian parliament who used to represent the populist Five Star Movement, claimed in the Italian parliament in May that philanthropist Bill Gates was behind a vaccination drive aimed at \"absolute domination over human beings reduced to guinea pigs and slaves.\"\\u202f \\nVideos supporting her gained almost 1,730,000 views on YouTube in only two days, and three of them received nearly 600,000 interactions on Facebook, according to the Atlantic Council\\'s Digital Forensic Research Lab. The hashtag #IoStoConSaraCunial (\"I Stand\\u202fWith\\u202fSara\\u202fCunial\") gained 5 million impressions on Twitter within 48 hours.\\nFacebook later noted on the video of Cunial speaking that \"independent fact-checkers say that this information has no basis in fact.\"\\nReal consequences\\nSome might dismiss the QAnon phenomenon as the online paranoia of a tiny minority, but it\\'s had and still has real-world consequences. In December 2016, a 28-year old man from North Carolina fired three shots at the DC pizza restaurant supposedly at the heart of the PizzaGate conspiracy. \\nQAnon has since lured in thousands of people genuinely concerned about the real rise in abuse and pedophilia reported by child protection agencies, an increase they associate with the impact of the pandemic. \\nIn the UK the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children told CNN that the issue of sexual abuse of children is an \"incredibly emotive issue\" and whipping it up can lead to vigilante action.\\n\"We can\\'t protect children by fueling a moral panic,\" said NSPCC\\'s Andy Burrows. \\nBurrows told CNN that social media platforms \"have been exploited and built services without an understanding of how they could lead to mischief increasing.\"\\nA film called \"UK\\'s Hidden Shadows\" claiming child abuse by secret elites in Britain has surpassed 500,000 YouTube views.\\nSeveral groups that combat child abuse say it has disrupted their work. KidSafe, an international charity devoted to keeping children safe, said QAnon \"associate their message of hate and bigotry with well-known, well-regarded organizations.\" \\n\"That strategy threatens to diminish our identities, tarnish our reputations and harm our good works,\" KidSafe said. \\nFew QAnon accounts or groups explicitly call for violence, though plenty abuse and harass journalists who report on the phenomenon.\\nHowever, some who become obsessed with conspiracy theories are prone to violence. In a 2019 internal memo, the FBI said that involvement with QAnon could \"occasionally induce both groups and individual extremists\" to \"carry out criminal or violent acts.\"\\nIn February this year Tobias Rathjen shot dead nine people at two shisha bars in immigrant areas of the German city of Hanau before killing himself. The 43-year-old extremist left behind a rambling screed that combined racism with a lot of the themes circulated by QAnon, but he didn\\'t specifically mention\\u202fQAnon.\\u202f\\nOne reason that QAnon is so hard to track is its diffusion across so many online platforms. \\nGraphika, which analyzes social media networks and how they evolve, told CNN that it had migrated to mainstream platforms quickly after starting out at the fringe on Gab, 4chan and 8chan, unfiltered websites that are popular with extremist groups. QAnon followings now populate all the main platforms: Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and\\u202fReddit.\\u202f  \\nThe major social media platforms have begun taking action against QAnon. Twitter said it had removed some 7,000 QAnon-associated accounts in July.\\nOn September 30, Facebook announced it was \"prohibiting anyone on our platform from running ads that praise, support or represent militarized social movements and QAnon.\"\\nEven so, the tech companies are struggling to keep up with the proliferation of conspiracy theories and incitement pushed by QAnon followers in multiple languages around the world.\\nIt\\'s obviously a tough call to delete or restrict accounts that appear to campaign against child trafficking. But Facebook has decided that because QAnon followers use hashtags like #savethechildren, it would \"direct people to credible child safety resources when they search for certain child safety hashtags.\" \\nThousands of QAnon followers have migrated to the less-regulated space of Telegram.\\nOliver\\u202fJanich -- a self-described German libertarian who lives in the Philippines -- has been promoting QAnon for nearly three years. In one video he asked: \"Who is Q? Trump\\'s secret agent?\" He began this year with 40,000 subscribers on Telegram. By late September, he had 140,000.\\nA former television journalist, Eva Herman, who has become an icon of QAnon in Germany, had 141,000 members on her Telegram channel at the end of September. She has promoted several themes popular among QAnon followers. A YouTube discussion in May between Herman and the German singer Xavier Naidoo, who also embraced QAnon theories, garnered nearly 1 million views.\\nQAnon followers often create back-up accounts to avoid being shut down. \"Instead of having one big group that the platforms might be able to delete, they spread out and formed local groups,\" Holnburger said. \\nMiro Dittrich, who tracks far-right extremism at the Berlin-based Amadeu-Antonio-Foundation, likens QAnon to a mushroom. \"The roots of a mushroom grow and grow. And whenever there\\'s a crisis, the blooming of mushrooms gets activated.\"\\nCompounding the problem is the lack of obvious avenues for\\u202f QAnon followers to \"detox\" or for people to seek advice on coping with family members seduced by QAnon. Christoph Grotepass at Sekten-Info NRW, a counseling service in Germany, told CNN that \"roughly a quarter to a third of the inquiries regarding conspiracy narratives explicitly refer to QAnon.\" Inquiries from relatives concerned about conspiracy narratives \"have already more than doubled compared to the whole last year,\" Grotepass added.\\nViktor \\u202f-- the Russian living in Germany -- endured a long struggle to escape QAnon. But when he did, he went back to Reddit and volunteered to help.\\u202f\\n\"I want to contribute to other people about my experience to help them, I hope it\\'s like a vaccine,\" he said. \\nBut combating QAnon is a formidable task. Facebook said Tuesday that even as it had removed some content supporting violence, \"we\\'ve seen other QAnon content tied to different forms of real world harm, including recent claims that the [US] west coast wildfires were started by certain groups.\"\\n\"Additionally, QAnon messaging changes very quickly and we see networks of supporters build an audience with one message and then quickly pivot to another,\" Facebook added.\\nThat echoes CNN\\'s investigation: as an online phenomenon QAnon mutates with incredible speed across a range of seemingly unconnected themes -- all of them potent falsehoods. \\nHow CNN reported this story \\nFor this story, CNN created a data set of public Facebook groups and pages that publish QAnon theories across the globe. We excluded US QAnon sites because we sought to focus on QAnon\\'s presence beyond the United States.\\nWe based our data on a list of pages and groups compiled by Marc-André Argentino, a PhD candidate at Concordia University and an associate fellow at the Global Network on Extremism & Technology who has researched QAnon. CNN spoke with Argentino to discuss his methodology for vetting QAnon Facebook pages and groups and expanded his dataset to show a more comprehensive set of QAnon sites based on the set of rules outlined below. \\nTo expand Argentino\\'s data, we searched on Facebook and on CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned platform that tracks public engagement with social media sites, for groups and pages with names that included \"QAnon\" or alternate spellings (such as \"CueAnon\"), or with a clear connection to the conspiracy theory.\\nWe categorized pages and groups by geographical origin using the information listed in the page or group\\'s \"About\" section and links on the Facebook page/group. If that was  missing, we looked at the page or group administrator\\'s listed location and the most prevalent language used on the page/group. When the information on origin was entirely missing or conflicting, we excluded those pages and groups. We also included pages and groups surfaced by CrowdTangle\\'s suggestion tool and included ones with QAnon in their names or with at least three pieces of QAnon-related content. \\nTo estimate the growth and the number of interactions with each page we used CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned platform that tracks public engagement with social media sites. We chose to view the data over a range from December 29, 2020 to September 20, 2020. Our engagement figures may include automated activity from fraudulent accounts, which we were unable to identify and exclude. It is unclear how prevalent it is on Facebook.\\nOur data may not be exhaustive as Facebook has continued to remove pages and groups from its platform that demonstrate support for QAnon. Meanwhile, new groups and pages are continuously being set up. We also could not include private groups in our searches and our searches may not have captured every QAnon-related page or group. This dataset therefore provides a snapshot of large QAnon groups and pages from across the world without necessarily reflecting the full picture.\\nCNN\\'s Frederik Pleitgen and Claudia Otto contributed to this report.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)An Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainee claims that three agents attempted to deport him despite an order preventing his removal and allegedly beat him when he refused to board the plane, according to a lawsuit filed Friday. \\nBakhodir Madjitov, a 39-year-old Muslim man from Uzbekistan, alleges that three ICE agents attempted to force him on a flight to his home country on June 10, 2019 at John F. Kennedy Airport despite having a stay of removal from the Third Circuit on his asylum case. Madjitov\\'s wife and three children are US citizens and live in Connecticut.  \\nWhen reached for comment, ICE spokesperson Bryan D. Cox said the agency doesn\\'t comment on pending litigation but noted that the \"absence of comment should in no way be construed as to suggest that ICE thinks any particular lawsuit has merit.\"\\nMadjitov\\'s attorneys are asking for compensatory and punitive damages from each ICE agent and the United States, as well as any other relief the court deems just and equitable, according to the lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of New York by the Council on American-Islamic Relations New York chapter and the New Haven Legal Assistance  Immigrant Rights Clinic.\\nWhen the agents took him to the airport, Madjitov informed each of the three agents of the stay, which his wife had confirmed with the court earlier in the day, the lawsuit states. When two of the agents checked, they allegedly said they couldn\\'t find any order from the court, the lawsuit continues, and Madjitov asked them to check again. The agents left the room and came back, one agent said he had called the court and confirmed there was nothing preventing his deportation, according to the lawsuit.\\nWhen Madjitov refused to board the flight by standing still and repeatedly asking them to honor the stay, officers allegedly threatened him, saying they would tase him and force him on the plane, according to the lawsuit. When he still refused, the agents allegedly pushed him against a wall and one agent tased him twice in the back, the lawsuit states. The lawsuit then claims that the agents pushed him to the ground and handcuffed him.\\nThe agents then allegedly picked up Madjitov and forced him to go back to the van they brought him in, even though he was crying from the pain of the altercation, according to the lawsuit. Local police officers asked the ICE agents if Madjitov was OK and if he needed medical attention. ICE agents then offered to call an ambulance to take Madjitov to a hospital, the lawsuit says. Madjitov agreed and was transported to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, the lawsuit continued.\\nWhile at the hospital, two of the ICE agents allegedly interfered in Madjitov\\'s care and would interrupt when he tried to explain his injuries, the lawsuit says. At one point, one of the agents grabbed his discharge papers before he could see them, the lawsuit continued, and the doctor edited and reprinted the paperwork. According to Madjitov, some of the sections of his discharge paperwork contradict what he told medical officials and didn\\'t include some of his injuries. \\nCNN has reached out to Jamaica Hospital for comment on the accusations, but the hospital is not listed as a defendant on the lawsuit.\\nThe lawsuit also claims that ICE agents wouldn\\'t allow Madjitov to go to the bathroom until they were leaving the hospital and refused to uncuff him so he could properly wash his hands and face before prayer. \\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)Chief Justice John Roberts faces a new period of Supreme Court turmoil that could define him and his legacy like nothing he confronted in the past 15 years, when he sided with liberals on Obamacare, clashed with President Donald Trump, and presided over an historic impeachment trial.  \\nThe new Supreme Court session that begins on Monday will determine, among a raft of contentious cases, the future of the Affordable Care Act and insurance coverage for more than 20 million people.\\nMore urgently, election-related cases are hurtling toward the court and the chances the justices would become ensnarled in a presidential dispute after November 3 appear high. Some version of the 2000 Bush v. Gore case could play out in a ballot controversy between Republican Trump and Democratic former vice president Joe Biden.\\nAt the same time, Senate Republicans want to move swiftly to confirm Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, now a federal appeals court judge based in Indiana. The replacement of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on September 18, with hard-core conservative Barrett is likely to destabilize the fragile control Roberts had exercised as the justice at the ideological middle of the bench. \\nThe 65-year-old Roberts would soon be negotiating with a solid majority of five justices on his right. The new court makeup would increase the chances of lopsided decisions that belie Roberts\\' assertion of an impartial judiciary.\\nWith little relief from the coronavirus, which has now infected President Trump, the public will witness how a sudden 6-3, conservative-liberal split affects the constitutionality of Obamacare, scheduled for oral arguments one week after the election. Also pending are emergency filings related to abortion rights and how undocumented immigrants will be counted in the 2020 census.\\nAll told, the next few months could redefine the Roberts court in the American eye and shape public expectations of the justices in the years to come.\\n\"If the Supreme Court gets involved in the election,\" said Yale law professor Cristina Rodriguez, \"that could have long term repercussions for the court, and I think Roberts will be very aware of that.\"\\nRodriguez recalled the late Justice John Paul Stevens\\' admonition, in dissent, during the dispute between George W. Bush and Al Gore that, \"Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year\\'s Presidential election, the identity of the loser is perfectly clear. It is the Nation\\'s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.\"\\nAdded Rodriguez, comparing 2000 and today: \"This election is much higher stakes.\" \\nLess room to maneuver in the middle\\nIn the last term, Roberts, a 2005 appointee of President Bush, exerted unprecedented control. He steered the majority in disputes over abortion rights, immigration and subpoenas for Trump\\'s financial documents.\\nRoberts, at the time a crucial fifth vote for the right-wing, also deterred his colleagues from taking up new appeals that could lead to expansion of Second Amendment individual gun rights. \\nBut the expected addition of sixth conservative Barrett means five solid conservatives to Roberts\\' right, for a likelier majority, for example, to curtail firearm regulations. Barrett would join fellow conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Remaining liberals are Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\\nRoberts will have less maneuvering room at the center, to be sure, but he will still be able to assign the opinions when he is in the majority on a case. He can keep the opinion for himself or give it to another justice, perhaps as a point of leverage with colleagues relishing the opportunity to write opinions for the court in important cases. \\nHe cast the key fifth vote in 2012 to uphold the Obamacare law that provided insurance coverage for millions more Americans, expanded Medicaid and guaranteed free mammograms, cholesterol checks and birth control. The law also prevents insurers from denying coverage to people based on pre-existing conditions such as cancer and diabetes. \\nThe current case, brought by Texas and other Republican-led states and backed by the Trump administration, attempts to invalidate the entire law. They assert that the act\\'s individual insurance mandate, tied to a tax that Congress zeroed-out in 2017, is now unconstitutional and that the entire law must fall with it. \\n \\nRoberts has faced ongoing fury from Trump and some Republicans for his earlier health care votes, in 2012 and a separate 2015 dispute. He infuriated the same crowd last term when he cast the decisive vote, with the four liberals (including Ginsburg) to preserve an Obama-era program that protects young immigrants who came to the US without proper papers.\\nA year earlier, he voted with the same four liberals to block a citizenship question on the 2020 census. In a new census fight, the Trump administration has appealed to the high court to let it exclude undocumented immigrants from being counted for the re-allocation of congressional seats in the 50 states next year. \\nRoberts, to be clear, is no liberal. He has been a generally reliable conservative, most notably on issues of voting rights, racial remedies and campaign finance. But more than anyone in the conservative bloc, he has worked to minimize partisan divisions.\\nTrump, who has long condemned Roberts for his 2012 Obamacare vote, has continued to rail against his rulings. After the decision rejecting Trump\\'s attempt to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, often called the \"Dreamers\" program, Trump said on Twitter June 18: \"Do you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn\\'t like me?\"\\nThe leaders of the executive and judicial branches tangled most visibly in November 2018.\\nAfter Trump derided a federal district court judge who ruled against the administration as \"an Obama judge,\" Roberts put out a statement that said: \"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\"\\nTrump fired back, \"Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have \\'Obama judges,\\' and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country.\"\\nBush v. Gore redux?\\nThe ultimate Trump-related challenge could come with litigation related to the presidential election, perhaps over how to tally certain absentee ballots or state leeway for meeting federal deadlines to turn over final electoral college counts to Congress.  \\nSpeaking of the presidential contest last month, Trump said, \"I think this will end up at the Supreme Court. And I think it\\'s very important that we have nine justices.\" He has signaled he believes the addition of Barrett, who would be his third high court appointee, would help his side -- if it came to that.\\nRoberts, as an attorney in private practice in 2000, assisted former Texas Gov. Bush\\'s legal team in the election controversy against then Vice President Gore. The Supreme Court\\'s 5-4 decision on December 12 ended Florida recounts and ensured Bush won the White House.\\nRoberts would be aware of how much the 36-day ordeal divided the country, and that today\\'s political atmosphere is more fraught. If such an election battle were to reach the justices, it would be even more likely to undermine the integrity of the high court.\\n\"If the court ends up playing a decisive role, it\\'s virtually inevitable that the losing side will view the court as a partisan player,\" said New York University law professor Richard Pildes, a CNN election law analyst. \"This is a very delicate moment for the court and Chief Justice Roberts.\"\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)President Donald Trump\\'s increasingly naked race-baiting heading into the final stretch of the 2020 campaign suggests he shares the consensus explanation for his grip on White working-class voters: it\\'s about their racial resentments, not their economic anxieties.  \\nBut what if one drives the other -- that is, what if racial resentments actually make the economic problems of blue-collar Whites worse? That\\'s the provocative thesis of a new book on the American economy. And if it\\'s right, Trump\\'s jagged-edged strategy this fall may prove more costly than either supporters or opponents realize. \\nFor the last six months, coronavirus has obscured the core political debate about the 21st century economy. But that debate -- over the inability to deliver broadly-shared prosperity even in good times -- has not disappeared. \\nThe causes of the problem have grown familiar. Technological change, globalization, and the mobility of capital have combined to lift the incomes of skilled, well-educated workers, while devaluing, eliminating or shipping overseas jobs that once afforded middle-class living standards for those without college degrees. \\nThe declining power of labor unions and declining value of the minimum wage exacerbated that working-class erosion. The emergence of China as an economic competitor -- with a bipartisan boost from Washington -- accelerated and deepened its impact. It all has produced an economy that produces fewer middle-class livelihoods and widening inequality of income even as it reliably generates corporate profits. \\nLess familiar is the factor described by Jim Tankersley in his just-published book \"The Riches of This Land.\" Drawing on decades of economic research, the New York Times correspondent argues discrimination against non-Whites and women historically throttled America\\'s capitalist engine by constricting the supply of talented labor -- and is doing it again now. \\nThe academic term for those costs is \"friction,\" which chafes at the efficiency of the economic marketplace. Among the examples Tankersley cites: in 1960, White men represented 95% of America\\'s doctors and lawyers, but not 95% of those best able to work as doctors and lawyers. The exclusion of those with greater ability degraded the output of both professions. \\nIn the decade that followed, expanded opportunities the civil rights and women\\'s movements yielded led to economic as well as social benefits. Annual growth during the 1960s averaged 4.5%, a level the US economy hasn\\'t seen in a single year over the last two decades. \\nThe tight labor market increased wages faster than inflation, lifting all groups. Large numbers of White and Black men alike rose into the middle class; over time, the pay gap between men and women narrowed. Researchers from Stanford and the University of Chicago last year found that 40% of expanded output per worker since 1960 stemmed from opening the labor force to new talent. \\nTankersley laments that progress proved halting. The separate economic forces punishing less-educated workers fueled a divisive political blame game variously targeting affirmative action programs, welfare recipients, immigrants, international trade deals, big business, and presidents of both parties.  \\n\"Mass incarceration\" policies in response to rising crime rates heightened obstacles for Black men. In 2017, a study by economists at Vanderbilt and the University of Tennessee found the likelihood of young Black men climbing the economic ladder lagged behind that of young White men by as much as it did just after the Civil War.  \\nRecent efforts to limit immigration in the name of shielding those already here carry obvious economic costs; the nation needs more taxpaying workers to finance retirement benefits for aging Baby Boomers. But the political evidence suggests those tensions will worsen as Whites alarmed by cultural change watch themselves become a minority of the population. \\nThe first Black president found that out. Backlash to Barack Obama\\'s breakthrough 2008 election helped cost his party control of Congress -- and cost Obama the chance to win \"human capital\" investments to boost working-class prospects for all races. Joe Biden now seeks a more expansive version of that agenda.   \\nTrump\\'s agenda hasn\\'t changed much for the \"forgotten\" blue-collar Whites he publicly champions. Tax cuts and deregulation mostly benefitted the affluent. Trade tariffs and immigration policies didn\\'t stop the manufacturing sector from falling into recession in 2019 -- before coronavirus sent the entire economy into recession this year. \\n\"The United States would be a very different country today if the shared prosperity of the postwar era, the upward talent flow that lifted everyone, had endured for another half-century,\" Tankersley concludes. He hasn\\'t abandoned hope for a more harmonious and prosperous era.\\nThe Trump White House has not been blind to the costs of discrimination. Marianne Wanamaker, the University of Tennessee economist who documented the lack of economic mobility for generations of young Black men, joined his Council of Economic Advisers soon after publishing that research. \\nThere\\'s no sign it left a mark on Trump. After excoriating Latino immigrants four years ago, he has made Black Lives Matter protestors against police violence his foil for \"law and order\" appeals to working-class Whites.\\nThe President now warns that desegregation regulations menace American suburbs, rails against racial sensitivity training, and defends symbols of the Confederacy -- and he says systemic racism does not exist.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden have taken very different positions on a range of policy issues. Hear from Trump and Biden in their own words how they would tackle the problems facing the United States. \\nCovid-19\\nBiden\\'s plan to address the pandemic includes offering free testing to all Americans. It calls for hiring 100,000 people for national contact-tracing, as well as increasing drive-thru testing sites. He is also urging Trump to use the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of protective equipment for health care workers, testing supplies and other items. Biden\\'s plan includes steps designed to help businesses and schools reopen, including financial support for retaining and rehiring workers, building a best-practices clearinghouse for schools and guaranteeing paid leave for anyone with coronavirus or who is caring for someone with the virus. The former vice president also said he would call Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, shortly after being declared the winner of the general election to ask him to remain a member of the White House coronavirus task force. Biden has said he would mandate that everyone wear a mask in public.\\nIn January, as the coronavirus outbreak began, the White House formed a task force that included Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the US Government Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared the coronavirus a public health emergency in the United States. In February, the US began implementing stringent travel restrictions in an effort to contain the outbreak, which included temporarily denying entry to foreign nationals who had visited China in the 14 days prior to their arrival in the US. Public health officials in Trump\\'s administration have urged Americans to practice social distancing and wear masks to slow the spread of the virus, but Trump himself has been reluctant to wear a mask in public. The President said that he didn\\'t believe making masks mandatory across the country was necessary, but said in July that he is \"all for masks\" and that he \"thinks masks are good.\" Trump has repeatedly downplayed the need for increased testing, and told supporters at a June rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that Covid-19 testing was \"a double-edged sword.\" \"When you do testing to that extent, you\\'re going to find more people,\" he said during the rally. \"You\\'re going to find more cases. So I said to my people, \\'Slow the testing down, please.\\' \"\\nHealth Care\\nBiden\\'s health care plan would greatly expand Obamacare\\'s subsidies to make the private insurance policies available on the exchanges more affordable. The plan would also create a new \"public option\" similar to Medicare that people could buy into. \"We\\'re going to add to it a public option. And the public option says whether you are having employer-based insurance or private insurance, or you\\'re in the exchange, you can join up for a Medicaid-Medicare-like provision in the law and not dump 300 million people on Medicare all of a sudden,\" he said in July 2019. Biden added that those covered by employer-based health insurance plans could also choose the public plan if they prefer it. \"You can sign up and get this other plan,\" he said. \"But if you like (your private insurance), you\\'re able to keep it.\"\\nTrump on September 24 laid out what he called his \"vision\" for health care in America, but the two executive orders Trump said he was going to sign fall far short of a comprehensive proposal. Trump said he was signing an executive order to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, even as Trump and Republican lawmakers attempt to try to tear down the Affordable Care Act that already protects them.\\xa0The second executive order directs Congress to pass legislation to address surprise medical billing by the end of the year, and if lawmakers don\\'t achieve this, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar will seek to do so via executive or regulatory action. Trump campaigned against the Affordable Care Act on the runup to his presidency. While the Republican-controlled Congress failed to repeal the law, Trump has taken a number of executive actions to undermine it, including making it easier for Americans to access alternative policies that have fewer protections and benefits. The administration is also seeking to invalidate the landmark health care law through the courts. Trump has promised to reduce drug prices and unveiled a blueprint to do so in 2018. Bucking long-standing Republican beliefs, the President is pushing to allow drug importation, particularly from Canada, and to tie the price of drugs in the US to their cost in other developed nations. However, several of his efforts have been stymied, including requiring drug makers to include their list prices in TV ads, which was nixed by a federal judge in summer 2019. In an effort to lower health care costs overall, the administration also issued a rule requiring hospitals to post the rates they negotiate privately with health insurers, starting in 2021. A coalition of major hospital groups took legal action to block the requirement.\\nThe Economy \\nBoosting the middle class is one of the main pillars of Biden\\'s campaign. He has said the country needs to build an economy that \"rewards work, not just wealth.\" Biden wants to repeal the tax cuts enacted by the Trump administration and is pushing for a $15 minimum hourly wage, eliminating noncompete agreements for workers and expanding access to affordable education, including free community college. Biden\\'s plan to address the coronavirus pandemic also includes steps designed to help businesses and schools reopen, including financial support for retaining and rehiring workers, building a best-practices clearinghouse for schools and guaranteeing paid leave for anyone with coronavirus or who is caring for someone with the virus. In an interview with CNN in July 2019, Biden said he would raise the top individual income tax rate to 39.5% and raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. Biden has detailed a moderate proposal to use government purchasing to spur manufacturing in sectors including clean energy, infrastructure and health care. He has also proposed new tax credits for those who care for children, seniors and disabled people. Biden said he would build tens of thousands of new child-care facilities as part of a plan to bolster what his campaign called the \"caregiving economy.\" Biden\\'s climate plan also aims to spur the creation of millions of new jobs and focuses on infrastructure. His climate plan is part of a series of economic plans aimed at jump-starting an economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic. \\nCongress passed and Trump signed the largest emergency aid package in US history on March 27 in response to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The roughly $2 trillion CARES Act stimulus package included, among a myriad of other items, direct financial assistance to Americans. A large part of the stimulus package is the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program, which provides forgivable loans to small businesses if at least 75% of the money goes toward payroll expenses. During an interview with Politico on April 25, Biden argued that another stimulus package was needed and should be \"a hell of a lot bigger\" than the CARES Act. On March 18, Trump signed into law a coronavirus relief package. The package included provisions for free testing for Covid-19 and paid emergency leave for certain people impacted by the coronavirus, with payments capped at $511 a day. It also increased Medicaid funding, certain tax credits, and expanded food assistance. There are many critics of these programs and packages and a good deal of evidence that some of the funds did not go to those Americans and small businesses most in need. Trump\\'s major economic policy achievement in office was the 2017 tax cut, which drastically reduced rates for individuals and businesses -- but led to a rise in the federal budget deficit to nearly $1 trillion in fiscal year 2019, undermining a campaign promise to not just shrink deficits but eliminate the national debt altogether by the end of a second term.\\nPolice Reform\\nBiden has said he does not support calls to \"defund the police,\" which picked up steam after the police killings of George Floyd in Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky, as well as others. But he does support some of the principles the phrase\\'s advocates champion. Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates has said that Biden supports \"the urgent need for reform -- including funding for public schools, summer programs, and mental health and substance abuse treatment separate from funding for policing -- so that officers can focus on the job of policing.\" Biden\\'s campaign has said he backs proposals to increase spending on social programs separate from local police budgets, but he also wants more funding for police reforms such as body cameras and training on community policing approaches. Biden has called for an additional $300 million in funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services program, which would allow more officers to be hired and would pay for training on community policing approaches.\\nTrump has declared himself \"your President of law and order\" amid nationwide protests over systemic racism and police brutality in America. He has lambasted efforts to defund police departments and has said police were owed respect for their work. In June, he signed an order to enact modest reforms in a move to confront the outcry over police brutality, including a tracking program that will encourage localities to submit information on officers who have been fired or found in court to have used excessive force. The Justice Department will also direct federal grants toward police departments that are credentialed for having use of force and de-escalation policies and banning the use of chokeholds, except when lethal force is authorized. Working with federal health officials, the department will increase training on programs that pair social workers with police to answer mental health and homelessness calls. The Justice Department\\'s political leadership under the Trump administration has endorsed a policing policy that prioritized stamping out a national uptick in violent crime and boosting the morale of street cops, who the Trump administration claimed had been antagonized under the Obama era.\\nGun Violence \\nBiden has said he will push to ban so-called assault weapons if elected. In a New York Times op-ed, Biden -- who helped lead the effort to ban assault weapons in the 1990s -- wrote that the United States has a \"huge problem with guns,\" and that assault weapons, which he defined as \"military-style firearms designed to fire rapidly,\" are a threat to US national security. He also told CNN\\'s Anderson Cooper that he would push for a federal gun buyback program in an attempt to take more weapons off the streets. He supports universal background checks, and said assault weapons \"should be illegal. Period.\" In the first Democratic presidential debate, Biden called for \"smart guns\" -- requiring manufacturers to include biometric measures that would block firearms from being used by those whose fingerprints aren\\'t registered for that specific gun. He has also focused further on gun manufacturers. \"Our enemy is the gun manufacturers, not the NRA. The gun manufacturers,\" he said at the debate.\\nIn the wake of mass shootings throughout his presidency, Trump has vowed action on gun violence, including expanding background checks. But he has been vague on the details, and has repeatedly pointed to mental health and hate as the underlying issues. After the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Trump order the Department of Justice to ban bump stocks, attachments that effectively make semi-automatic rifles fire continuously. The ban became effective in March 2019. The President has backed \"red flag\" gun laws on the state level, which enable those who have seen warning signs to seek court orders to intervene and prevent someone who is in crisis from temporarily having access to firearms.\\nImmigration \\nBiden supports a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. He has also called on Congress to immediately grant citizenship to some undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children. At the first Democratic presidential debate in June, Biden said that undocumented immigrants with no criminal records \"should not be the focus of deportation.\" In an interview with CNN in July 2019, Biden said he opposes decriminalizing crossing the border without documentation, something other candidates in the field have supported. \"I think people should have to get in line, but if people are coming because they\\'re actually seeking asylum, they should have a chance to make their case,\" Biden said. \\nDuring his 2016 campaign, Trump proposed the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border, and has made it a tenet of his immigration policy as President. After taking office, he issued an executive order suspending the entry of people from a number of Muslim-majority countries for 90 days; the order went through several iterations in court before it was upheld. The administration\\'s \"zero tolerance\" policy in 2018 -- criminal prosecutions of adults who illegally crossed the border -- resulted in thousands of family separations at the border as parents were detained. Under a court order, the government must identify and reunify certain separated children. The President has proposed a merit-based immigration system, establishing a points-based system for green card holders and restricting sponsorship to spouses and minor children. Trump also officially ended Obama-era protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought into the country as children, a decision that has now been taken to the Supreme Court.\\nEducation \\nBiden has proposed an education plan that would increase funding for schools in low-income areas, help teachers pay off student loans and double the number of health professionals working in schools. A core element involves tripling federal Title I funding for schools that serve low-income areas, closing what his campaign called a $23 billion funding gap between majority white and nonwhite school districts. In October 2019, Biden unveiled a plan that would cut student loan debt obligations, waiving $10,000 per year -- for up to five years -- for those in public service work, like teachers or members of the military. He would also guarantee that those earning less than $25,000 owe nothing on their undergraduate federal student loans, while everyone else\\'s payments would be capped at 5% of their discretionary income above $25,000 -- halving the current 10% cap. His plans heavily emphasize executive action. Biden said at an American Federation of Teachers forum in Houston in May 2019 that \"the bulk of\" his education proposals can become law even if Republicans maintain control of the Senate after the 2020 elections.\\nTrump, as President, has vowed to fix student loan debt. As directed by an executive order, the Department of Education published new data in November 2019 about graduates\\' income and debt levels aimed at helping students make more informed borrowing decisions before choosing colleges. The White House has also made loan forgiveness automatic for veterans with disabilities and urged Congress to include place a cap on student loan borrowing. By contrast, it has repeatedly proposed ending a student loan forgiveness program for public workers, but Congress has rejected those efforts. The administration has pushed for a school choice tax credit known as \"Education Freedom Scholarships,\" which students could use to attend public or private schools, including charters, outside of their districts. It has rescinded a number of Obama-era policies, including those that promoted racial diversity in schools and protections for transgender students in public schools that let them use bathrooms and other facilities corresponding to their gender identities. It has also rolled back two rules that were intended to hold for-profit colleges accountable.\\nForeign Relations \\nA central argument of Biden\\'s campaign for president is that the former Vice President has extensive foreign policy experience from his eight years serving in the White House and from traveling the globe as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In June, Biden pledged to undo President Donald Trump\\'s foreign policy moves in a speech in which the former vice president laid out how he would seek to restore pre-Trump international norms and \"place America back at the head of the table.\" The centerpiece of Biden\\'s effort to return to international cooperation is a summit that Biden said he would call among the world\\'s democracies, non-governmental organizations and corporations -- particularly tech and social media companies -- to seek a common agenda to protect their shared values. Such a summit would push companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter -- where Russian trolls reached American voters during the 2016 election -- to combat challenges such as surveillance, censorship and the spread of hate speech. While in the Senate, Biden voted to authorize the war in Iraq in 2002. Like other Democrats who voted yes, Biden has spent the years since apologizing for it as the conflict became increasingly unpopular with the American public and Democratic voters.\\nTrump has made a series of unpredictable moves on trade, including the imposition of tariffs against allies like the European Union. Trump has also engaged in a two-year trade war with China, imposing an escalating series of retaliatory tariffs that have hit American farmers, importers and manufacturers. He announced plans to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Negotiations and Agreement, an Obama-era trade deal among a number of countries, soon after taking office in 2017. Preferring bilateral deals, he signed a new trade pact with Japan in 2019 -- but it was no better for American ranchers and farmers than the Trans-Pacific Partnership would have been. His administration also renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement, the trade pact with Canada and Mexico. The countries have since agreed to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, but it is pending ratification by the US Congress.\\nClimate Crisis\\nBiden in July 2020 proposed spending $2 trillion over four years on clean energy projects and ending carbon emissions from power plants by 2035. In a speech detailing the plan, Biden called the threat posed by climate change a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to jolt new life into our economy.\" The plan marks a clear shift by Biden toward progressives\\' goals of urgently reducing fossil fuel consumption to combat climate change. Biden\\'s new proposal is more ambitious than the 10-year, $1.7 trillion plan he\\'d offered during the Democratic primary, which included the goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. His proposed 100% clean electricity standard by 2035 is modeled after a proposal initially offered by Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and later embraced by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The same aim was included in a series of recommendations recently negotiated by a task force made up of members appointed by Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and co-chaired by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a chief proponent of the Green New Deal.\\nTrump\\'s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord -- a landmark 2015 deal on global warming targets -- was a major blow to the global response to the climate crisis. The decision sent a message to the rest of the world that the US -- which can legally leave the agreement as early as 2020 -- would not be leading the global fight against climate change. Trump\\'s EPA chief has said that while he believes in climate change, it is not a top priority. The administration shrunk two of Utah\\'s national monuments. It has also pushed to open Alaska\\'s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration, as well as waters along the East and Pacific coasts. Under the Trump administration, the EPA announced it would no longer require oil and gas companies to install monitors to detect methane leaks from new wells, tanks and pipelines.\\nCNN\\'s Eric Bradner contributed to this report. \\n'},\n",

The Trump administration has criticized TPS, arguing that repeated extensions of the status are contrary to its purpose and moved to terminate protections for certain countries. \\nIn a 2-1 ruling Monday, a panel of the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals found that, under the TPS statute, the Department of Homeland Security secretary \"possesses full and unreviewable discretion as to whether to consider intervening events in making a TPS determination.\" \\nUS Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Dan Hetlage said in a statement the agency is \"reviewing the decision and will announce updates as they are available.\"\\nTPS holders and their US citizen children had challenged the planned move to end the protections, arguing in part that the decision was motivated by racism.

       "  'body': 'This is the first in a three-part series on swing states in the 2020 election. Next week: The Southwest. October 20: The Rust Belt.\\n (CNN)For longtime Republicans in the Southeast states, the region\\'s political evolution has started to resemble a movie running in reverse.\\nAfter Democrats dominated the region for the first century after the Civil War, Republicans mostly established their initial inroads in states such as Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia during the 1970s and 1980s in the growing suburbs of the region\\'s metropolitan centers. Now the recoil of voters in those same suburbs against President Donald Trump\\'s definition of the GOP is fueling a Democratic resurgence across states that Republicans have dominated for decades. Like a film spooling backward, Republicans are retreating along the same suburban pathways they had followed to establish their first durable beachheads in the region.\\nYour big questions about voting and the 2020 election, answered\\nApart from Virginia, which now shades reliably blue, Republicans still hold the upper hand in the states across the Southeast. But while the GOP advantage remains lopsided in the Deep South states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, Democrats this year are showing clear signs of revival in North Carolina, Georgia and even South Carolina, while Florida appears headed for yet another of its trademark razor-thin results in the presidential race.\\nAcross the region, the Democratic recovery is being propelled by two common forces: a growing minority population and a shift toward Democrats among college-educated voters of all races, particularly in the burgeoning suburbs of the region\\'s major metropolitan centers, from Northern Virginia and Charlotte and Raleigh in North Carolina to Charleston in South Carolina along with Atlanta and Orlando. Even Louisiana and Alabama, though still much more solidly Republican overall, haven\\'t been immune from these dynamics, with Democrats recently electing Gov. John Bel Edwards in the former and Sen. Doug Jones in the latter.\\n\"Republicans are trading gains in smaller slower-growing counties for [losses in] larger faster-growing suburban counties,\" says longtime Republican pollster Whit Ayres, who first moved to the Southeast in the late 1960s to attend college and then stayed for the next three decades. \"That\\'s not a good trade-off in the long run.\"\\nA turning tide\\nThrough the final decades of the 20th century, and the first decade of the 21st, much of the Southeast was mostly an electoral wasteland for Democrats. From 1984 through 2016, Democratic presidential candidates carried North Carolina only once (Barack Obama in 2008), Georgia once (Bill Clinton narrowly in a three-way race in 1992) and South Carolina not at all. Democrats had carried Florida only once from 1984 through 2004 until Obama won it twice, before it reverted to Trump in 2016. Republicans carried Virginia in every presidential race from 1968 through 2004, before Democrats have now carried it in three consecutive elections.\\nThe Republican dominance was just as pronounced in other contests. Democrats now hold both US Senate seats in Virginia, but the GOP controls all eight in the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida (as well as all of them in the most ruby-red Deep South states except that of Jones, who faces long odds of reelection in Alabama next month). While Democrats have controlled the governor\\'s mansions most years since 2000 in Virginia and North Carolina, the party hasn\\'t elected a governor in Florida since 1994 or in Georgia and South Carolina since 1998.\\nAyres, though an Iowa native, watched this process unfold as a student in South Carolina and then North Carolina during the 1960s and 1970s, then as a college professor and an aide and political adviser to pioneering Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell in South Carolina during the 1980s, and later as a pollster based in Atlanta starting in 1991. (He\\'s now in Northern Virginia.)\\nThe GOP gains across the Southeast states over these years, Ayres noted, followed a common pattern. Across the region, \"what took the Republicans up was the White middle class,\" he says. \"The political scientists Earl and Merle Black used to call it \\'interstate Republicanism.\\' If you trace I-95 or I-26, you could find the Republican vote. It was basically a suburban middle-class base.\"\\nRace contributed significantly to the GOP gains in Southern suburbs from the 1970s through the 1990s: Those suburbs grew in part with an influx of White parents fleeing integrated urban schools and neighborhoods. But resistance to taxes, and conservative views on social issues such as abortion and gay rights -- even many White suburbanites with college degrees are evangelical Christians -- also hastened the Democratic decline among those voters during those decades.\\nCNN Election 101\\nJohn Anzalone, now the chief pollster for Joe Biden, watched that process unfold from the other column on the ballot. Born in Michigan, he relocated to Alabama in 1990. He arrived just in time for the GOP landslide during the 1994 midterms, as a backlash against Clinton\\'s chaotic first two years swept away a generation of Southern House Democrats who had doggedly held on to seats, often in mostly White rural areas, that had started voting Republican for president as far back as Richard Nixon. Over the next few years, Republicans gained majorities in Southeastern state legislatures that Democrats had typically controlled since Reconstruction after the Civil War.\\n\"The Republicans in the 1980s and early 1990s won the branding war on what the Democratic Party stood for,\" Anzalone says. \"It went from people saying in focus groups that \\'[Democrats] are for the little guy\\' to they are for taxes, big government, welfare -- which is the code word for Blacks -- and abortion.\"\\nVirginia\\nThrough the 1990s, Democrats managed only a few cracks in the towering red advantage across the region. The party\\'s first hint of recovery came in Virginia soon after 2000, with the elections of Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, in each case first to the governorship and then to the Senate. In 2004, Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, though still losing the state, made gains in the prospering Northern Virginia suburbs, becoming the first Democrat since Lyndon Johnson in 1964 to carry booming Fairfax County, outside Washington.\\nSince then the balance in Virginia has clearly tipped blue, with Democrats controlling not only both US Senate seats but also the governorship and state Legislature. Virginia was considered enough of a swing state in 2016 that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton sought to lock it down by picking Kaine as her running mate; this year, both sides consider it essentially impregnable for Democrats.\\nVirginia vividly encapsulates the two underlying trends reconfiguring the region\\'s politics. One is increasing racial and ethnic diversity, as growing numbers of Hispanics and Asian Americans have joined the state\\'s substantial African American community. In 2004, voters of color cast about 2-in-10 of the state\\'s ballots, according to census figures. By 2016, that number had increased to 3-in-10, according to analysis by the States of Change project, a research collaborative of three liberal-leaning groups -- the Center for American Progress, the Brookings Institution and the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group -- and the centrist Bipartisan Policy Center. The project studies the changing composition of the American electorate and its implications for policy and politics. \\nIn 2020 the minority share of the Virginia vote will edge up further to 32%, according to States of Change projections shared exclusively with CNN. Exit polls show that Democrats consistently amass huge advantages with Virginia\\'s Latino, Asian American and Black voters alike. \\nOver that same period, Whites without college degrees, the bedrock of the GOP coalition, have fallen from nearly half of Virginia\\'s voters to one-third in States of Change\\'s 2020 projection. College-educated Whites, who have migrated toward the Democrats in the state over that period, have stayed roughly constant at just over one-third of the state\\'s voters.\\nThe shift of those well-educated Whites underscores the second big change that has rearranged Virginia\\'s politics: the widening Democratic advantage in the largest population centers, including the suburbs of Washington and Richmond. In 2016, Clinton won five of the seven Virginia jurisdictions (including the city of Virginia Beach) that cast the most votes that year -- and carried the entire group by a crushing combined margin of 364,437 votes. As recently as 2004, President George W. Bush had carried five of those seven places by a combined margin of about 32,000 votes. Just in Fairfax County, the Democratic advantage ballooned from about 34,000 votes for Kerry to nearly 200,000 for Clinton. In the 2017 governor\\'s race, Democrat Ralph Northam won more than two-thirds of the vote in Fairfax, by far the state\\'s largest county.\\nOver this period, Republicans have consistently dominated the state\\'s small town and rural areas, and Trump widened their margins in those areas further in 2016. But that hasn\\'t come close to offsetting their losses in the population centers.\\nAt varying speeds, the other region\\'s key battlegrounds are on the same moving walkway that has transformed Virginia. In all of them, Democrats are benefiting from growing diversity and improved performance in burgeoning white-collar suburbs, while Republicans try to hold back the tide by maximizing their advantage among White and mostly Christian voters in stagnant or shrinking exurban, small-town and rural places. \\nNorth Carolina\\n\"Obviously in North Carolina, the Virginia process has gone quite a ways and Georgia is next on the list,\" says Jim Guth, a Republican activist and longtime political scientist at Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. \"South Carolina brings up the rear in these kinds of transitions, although we see signs of it here as well.\"\\nAs in Virginia, a major component of the North Carolina story is the growth in the minority population, as the long-established Black community is joined by a steady influx of Hispanics and Asian Americans. States of Change expects Black voters to cast a little over 1-in-5 of the state\\'s votes in 2020 and the contribution of those other groups to push the total for people of color to fully 3-in-10. That\\'s up from about 1-in-4 in 2004.\\nMaybe even more important to Democratic hopes have been their improving positions among college-educated White voters and in the large metropolitan areas more broadly. The metros centered on Charlotte and the Raleigh-Durham-Research Triangle Park area have been booming as sharp young college graduates migrate to the state to fill jobs in health care, pharmaceuticals, high-technology and finance.\\n\"In Durham, where I\\'m located, the number of high-end apartments, condominiums, apartments, in the city of Durham, not in the suburbs, is staggering,\" says Kerry Haynie, an associate professor of political science and African American studies at Duke University. \"There are million-dollar penthouses in the city of Durham and that\\'s unheard-of.\"\\nIn 2004, Kerry marked a milestone when he carried Mecklenburg County, centered on Charlotte and its suburbs, by nearly 12,000 votes, the biggest margin of victory there for any Democratic nominee since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944; by 2016, Clinton carried Mecklenburg by more than 139,000 votes. Wake County, centered on Raleigh, in 2004 gave Bush a margin of greater than 7,000 votes; Clinton carried Wake by nearly 107,000 votes. Overall, Clinton carried the five North Carolina counties that cast the most votes in 2016 by a margin of more than 408,000, compared with Kerry\\'s advantage of only about 34,000 votes in those same places.\\nYet such was Trump\\'s strength in rural communities that he won North Carolina nonetheless -- and by an even larger margin than Mitt Romney had in 2012. Trump won 76 of the state\\'s 100 counties and improved on Romney\\'s vote share in an even larger number of them, 79, according to an analysis of the results provided by Polidata, a political data firm.\\nMultiple recent North Carolina polls show that Biden is positioned to split or narrowly win college-educated White voters in the state, which would represent an improvement over both Clinton in 2016 and Obama in 2012 and 2008, according to exit polls. Biden is also consistently posting big advantages among African American voters (though he won\\'t match Obama\\'s overwhelming advantage and may struggle to entirely equal even Clinton\\'s number.) \\nTrump is still overwhelmingly strong among White voters without college degrees there: Recent surveys by pollsters from CBS to Fox News and Monmouth University all show the President still winning about two-thirds or more of them. But even that may represent a slight decline from his support in 2016 back to something closer to the deficits Obama faced when he won the state in 2008 and only narrowly lost it in 2012, according to exit polls and States of Change calculations. Those same polls show similar dynamics, though a deeper blue tilt overall, in the Senate race, where Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham has consistently led Republican Sen. Thom Tillis.\\nEven Democrats agree that Trump\\'s continued strength among blue-collar and rural Whites makes North Carolina one of the toughest swing states for Biden. \\nGeorgia\\nYet as the Trump campaign struggles to hold North Carolina it has found itself facing unexpectedly strong pressure in Georgia, where a succession of surveys has shown the former vice president essentially tied or even slightly ahead.\\nGeorgia has grown even more diverse than Virginia or North Carolina. With expanding Asian and Hispanic populations and a steady influx of African Americans reversing the \"great migration\" North to return to the Atlanta area, Georgia has seen the minority share of its vote rise from about 3-in-10 in 2004, according to the census, to nearly 4-in-10 in the States of Change projection for 2020.\\nAnd like Virginia and North Carolina, Georgia has seen economic activity and population growth increasingly concentrate in a few urban centers, particularly the Atlanta metropolitan area. But it has taken Georgia Democrats longer to establish a foothold in the suburbs of that booming community. In 2004, Kerry won only about one-third of the vote in both Cobb and Gwinnett, the giant suburban counties outside of Atlanta; even as recently as the 2014 governor\\'s race, Democrat Jason Carter won only a little over 40% of the vote in both, though he was Jimmy Carter\\'s grandson.\\nBut the voters in these well-educated and diverse communities have recoiled from Trump\\'s definition of the GOP. Clinton won both of them by narrow margins in 2016 and Stacey Abrams won them by bigger margins in the 2018 governor\\'s race, when Democrats also won a US House seat there and flipped several Republican state House districts. \\nGeorgia\\'s overall dynamic in 2016 closely resembled North Carolina\\'s but tilted further toward the GOP: Clinton won the five Georgia counties that cast the most ballots by more than 421,000 votes, compared with an advantage of fewer than 45,000 votes for Kerry. But overall Trump won 128 of the state\\'s 159 counties and improved on Romney\\'s margin in 122 of them, according to Polidata\\'s analysis. Similar dominance in exurban, small-town and rural areas allowed Republican Gov. Brian Kemp to beat Abrams despite her metro gains in 2018.\\nRepublicans are counting on the same equation to hold the state for Trump next month. But the party\\'s erosion in the fast-growing suburbs may be intensifying: While exit polls showed that Abrams won 40% of college-educated Whites (already roughly double the level Carter attracted in 2014) several recent polls show Biden pushing past that number into the mid-40s now. And as in North Carolina, he\\'s slightly reducing the Democrats\\' recent deficit with blue-collar Whites (though Trump is still drawing nearly three-fourths of them). Asked if Trump retained enough blue-collar strength to overcome his continued slide in Georgia\\'s white-collar suburbs, Ayres says, \"We\\'re going to find out. ... It\\'s pretty close.\"\\nSouth Carolina\\nWedged between North Carolina and Georgia, South Carolina has seemed immune to their trends. Though its minority population has grown, it has not seen the big influx of college-educated information-age workers that has changed the political equation for its neighbors. Although Clinton won big in the county centered on Columbia, the state capital, and narrowly carried Charleston, overall Trump carried the five counties that cast the most ballots there by nearly 79,000 votes. Combined with his strong position among evangelical, blue-collar and non-urban Whites, Trump, remains favored in the state.\\nBut Democratic US Senate candidate Jaime Harrison has shocked Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham by replicating the formula that has revived Democrats in the neighboring states. Polls show Harrison, who\\'s African American, drawing more than 90% of Black voters and pushing toward 50% among college-educated Whites. Graham is caught in the same demographic squeeze as Republicans elsewhere across the region: He\\'s still drawing more than two-thirds of Whites without college degrees, but they may cast only about 40% of the votes this fall, according to the States of Change projections, down from about half in 2004. \\nGuth, the political scientist and Republican activist, expects both Trump and Graham to win but believes that, win or lose, Harrison\\'s strong showing points toward a more competitive future in the state. \"Quite clearly the Republican strategy on doubling down on White working-class non-college-educated voters is reaching its limits,\" Guth says. \"Certainly you see the Republican majorities eroding in the urban areas, especially in bad years.\"\\nFlorida\\nFlorida, the region\\'s largest prize, with 29 Electoral College votes, both embodies and puts its own characteristic spin on these dynamics. Though Republicans dominate most local offices, Florida has become the most narrowly balanced mega-state in presidential politics. Steve Schale, a veteran Democratic Florida strategist, recently calculated that of some 51 million votes cast in presidential elections there since 1992, fewer than 20,000 separate the two parties. Seven statewide races in the past decade, Schale notes, have been decided by 1.2 percentage points or less.\\nFor campaigns, Florida is a Rubik\\'s Cube of almost impossible complexity, with 10 large media markets; a White population divided not only between college- and non-, younger and older, but further split between conservative Midwestern retirees on its west coast and more liberal Northeastern retirees in its southeast; and a non-White experience shaped by the striated differences between Central and South Americans, Cuban Americans and Puerto Ricans, and Caribbean and native-born Black voters. Except for Obama\\'s two victories, Democrats in particular have found the puzzle almost impossible to solve: Whenever they gain on one of these fronts, they seem to suffer offsetting losses on the other that leave them just short.\\n\"The first law of Florida elections,\" says Democratic pollster Carlos Odio, \"is that for every trend there is an equal and opposite trend somewhere else.\"\\nAt the highest level, Florida\\'s political evolution has followed the tracks rolling through the rest of the region: growing Republican strength with blue-collar and rural Whites has offset the Democratic gains in big urban centers and an increasing non-White population. Those counterpoised trends, says Schale, have \"led to this kind of stasis in Florida, where it stays the same.\" \\nDemocrats are facing another permutation of Florida\\'s Rubik\\'s Cube this year. Biden is running better than any recent Democratic nominee not only among college-educated but also older Whites. That should be enough to give him the advantage in Florida -- and in fact he\\'s consistently led narrowly in most polls there. But Biden is underperforming among Hispanics, not only Cuban Americans returning to the Republican roots that Clinton somewhat loosened, but also those from Central and South America and, in some Democratic surveys, even Puerto Ricans. With the state, as always, teetering between such crosscutting factors, few on either side would be surprised if Florida produces another photo finish.\\nIn the long run\\nNarrow outcomes in Florida, by this point, don\\'t shock anyone. More surprising is the extent of Democratic strength in the presidential and Senate races in North Carolina and Georgia and even the Senate contest in South Carolina. Most unnerving for Republicans is that in each of those states, Democrats are riding the same two waves -- growing diversity and increasing strength in well-educated suburbs -- that carried Virginia from reliably Republican in the 1990s to a swing state in the first years of this century to safely blue now. \\nAyres and Guth are skeptical that at any point in the near future North Carolina and Georgia, much less South Carolina, will tilt as reliably Democratic as Virginia. But neither sees Republicans restoring their recent dominance. \\n\"North Carolina and Georgia are much more Southern,\" says Ayres. \"I think purple is much more likely, because they are just much more Southern states and you don\\'t see the Research Triangle [in North Carolina] or Cobb and Gwinnett [in Georgia] becoming like Fairfax\" in providing Democrats such lopsided margins.\\nHaynie, who directs Duke\\'s Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity and Gender, agrees that these Southeastern states are unlikely to become Virginia anytime soon. But he predicts that all of them will become more challenging for the GOP as long as it aims its agenda primarily at the priorities and resentments of shrinking populations of non-college and evangelical Whites while alienating the groups in those states that are growing: white-collar professionals and people of color. \"Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina look similar in terms of the trajectory of the demographic shifts,\" he says.\\nThe Electoral College, explained\\nDemocrats may be unlikely to reach a position of dominance in the Southeast states, but even a more competitive standing, in which the party can occasionally win Senate seats and Electoral College votes from the region, would significantly change the national political equation. Pollster Anzalone, who persevered through the Democrats\\' darkest years across the region, believes Trump represents an inadvertent bookend to the process that propelled the GOP to its Southeastern dominance. Just as Republicans successfully defined Democrats as out of the mainstream to most White voters during the 1980s and 1990s, he says, Trump is stamping his own party today to many well-educated voters as biased against Blacks and immigrants, hostile to science and ideologically extreme.\\n\"The Republicans won the branding war on the Democrats,\" Anzalone says. \"The reason it\\'s reversing is interesting, because they are losing the branding war by themselves. They are their own problem in the branding war. Early on, they did a really good job of branding the Democrats, and now they are creating their own branding problems by not keeping up with voters\\' attitudes.\"\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)The Trump administration is considering putting up billboards of immigration violators, an unprecedented move in lockstep with the President\\'s law-and-order message ahead of the election, according to two sources familiar with the proposal. \\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly gone after so-called \"sanctuary cities\" -- cities that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities -- arguing that they put public safety at risk.\\nThe billboards would be put up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement -- the enforcement arm of the Department of Homeland Security -- in at least one city and would call attention to immigrants who have committed crimes and been released by local authorities. It\\'s unclear what the billboards will look like and at what cost. If the plan proceeds, it seems intended to single out sanctuary jurisdictions and stoke fear within those communities. \\nThe Department of Homeland Security, along with the Justice Department, have been criticized for efforts that look political to boost Trump amid a contentious election season. \\nMost recently, the two federal departments came under increased scrutiny for admonishing Portland, Oregon, where protests at times turned violent. DOJ also recently singled out three major Democratic-led cities -- Portland, New York City, and Seattle -- as having \"permitted violence and destruction of property.\"  \\nBut billboards for the purpose of singling out violators raises questions about what purpose it really serves. \"How are they getting funding for it? How does that advance their mission?\" said John Sandweg, former acting ICE director. \"Running billboards, it\\'s political messaging.\"\\nHotlines to solicit tips or campaigns to recruit personnel are common, Sandweg noted, but those are more clearly linked to helping advance the agency\\'s enforcement mission. \\nICE did not immediately comment for this report.\\nAt the start of his administration, Trump threatened to take federal funds from sanctuary jurisdictions in an executive order. He also floated the possibility of releasing immigrants into sanctuary cities in part to retaliate against Democrats.\\nThe Washington Post reported Tuesday that ICE is also preparing targeted arrests in cities that have adopted \"sanctuary\" policies. ICE said in a statement that it doesn\\'t comment on \"any law enforcement sensitive issues that may adversely impact our officers and the public.\"\\nMany of the largest cities in the country have sanctuary policies in place. The leaders behind them argue that such policies make communities safer because undocumented immigrants are\\u202fmore likely to report crimes\\u202fif they don\\'t fear deportation. \\nBut ICE says that when immigrants with criminal convictions are released, it requires additional time and resources for the agency and \"increases the occurrence of preventable crimes and preventable victims.\"\\nIn recent weeks, DHS has repeatedly pushed out ICE press releases on arrests. And acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf has taken to Twitter to call out jurisdictions that don\\'t cooperate with ICE. \\n\"Instead of working with @ICEgov enforce the law, local officials in Mecklenberg County, NC decided it would be better to give these criminals \\'sanctuary\\' so they could go back out on the streets — where they were free to reoffend until ICE arrested them,\" Wolf said in a tweet Wednesday. \\nOver the summer, ICE arrested more than 2,000 immigrants over the course of several weeks as part of an operation targeting people with criminal histories. \\nIn March, ICE said that it would temporarily adjust its enforcement posture, citing the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations focused enforcement on \"public-safety risks and individuals subject to mandatory detention based on criminal grounds.\" \\nThe agency has since said, citing lessons learned since the start of the pandemic, that it\\'s \"confident that our officers can properly and safely carry out operations.\"\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)More than two years since migrant families were torn apart at the US-Mexico border, disturbing details of what occurred behind the scenes continue to spill into public view -- again putting into focus the policy that came to define the Trump administration\\'s immigration legacy and cement its approach to immigrants. \\nIn 2018, the Trump administration announced the so-called \"zero tolerance\" policy, in which the Justice Department initiated criminal prosecutions of every adult illegally crossing the border. Doing so resulted in the separation of thousands of families, including those with infants, some only a few months old, because children can\\'t be kept in federal jail with their parents.\\nThe public outcry over the policy and its consequences was swift. So too was the case late Tuesday, when The New York Times reported that top Justice Department officials were the \"driving force\" behind the policy. \\nIn one May 2018 episode detailed in the Justice Department inspector general draft report that the Times reviewed, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions told a group of prosecutors on a conference call, \"We need to take away children,\" according to participants\\' notes, the Times reported.\\nThe \"zero tolerance\" policy has come to encapsulate the lengths the Trump administration is willing to go to in order to deter migrants from coming to the US, regardless of their circumstances, and the disarray that ensues when agencies are unprepared.  \\nTrump campaigned on cracking down on immigration to the US, pledging to build miles of border barriers and overhaul the legal immigration system. Combined, those promises have amounted to a series of policy changes designed to keep many immigrants out of the US. \\nSince the administration backtracked its \"zero tolerance\" policy, migrants have faced insurmountable challenges to claim asylum, have been required to stay in Mexico in deplorable conditions for their immigration hearing in the United States and, most recently, have been swiftly returned after being encountered at the southern border as a result of a public health order linked to the coronavirus pandemic -- to name a few. \\nThe desperation of some waiting in Mexico for their US immigration proceedings -- a policy informally known as \"remain in Mexico\" -- also led to more than 300 children crossing the border alone despite initially arriving with parents or relatives.  \\nUnlike \"zero tolerance,\" however, these policies have at times flown under the radar despite levying harm against migrants seeking asylum in the United States. \\n\"Once you start down the path of deterrence through the inflicting of harm, it\\'s very hard to find a stopping point,\" said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the American Immigration Council, a nonprofit group that advocates for the rights of immigrants.\\nThe US has for years relied on deterrence policy to dissuade migrants from coming to the country, but it often fails to take into account the driving factors behind migration, like economic disparity or violence and persecution. For example, during fiscal year 2019, following \"zero tolerance,\" border arrests reached record highs. \\n\"The goal of deterrence-based policies is to inflict a sufficient amount of pain in order to stop people from coming in the first place, and as we\\'ve seen with zero tolerance, the level of pain the Trump administration was willing to inflict on asylum-seeking migrants was enormous, including separation of parents and children,\" Reichlin-Melnick said. \\nPolicies like \"remain in Mexico,\" for example, have outsourced the harm to other countries, he added, even though the onus is still on the US. \\nDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has said he would reverse the Trump administration\\'s immigration policies but much of that message has been boiled down to refusing to separate families.\\nThe focus on one policy risks sidelining the litany of changes implemented under Trump that seek to stop asylum seekers and refugees. \\nAmid the highest levels of displacement around the world, for example, the Trump administration has gradually pulled back how many refugees it\\'s willing to accept -- from tens of thousands under previous administrations to a historic low of 15,000 in the upcoming fiscal year. \\n\\n'},\n",

Nonetheless, Furman concluded that \"at a minimum,\" DHS\\' decision should be declared unlawful to ensure that it cannot be reinstated. \\nIn February, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf announced that New York state residents would no longer be allowed to participate in certain Trusted Traveler Programs, including Global Entry, due to provisions in the state\\'s new \"Green Light Law,\" which supported undocumented immigrants.\\nThe New York law, which went into effect in December, allows undocumented immigrants to apply for New York driver\\'s licenses while protecting applicants\\' information from immigration enforcement agencies.

Later that same day, DHS admitted that it made false statements in court to defend its decision to block New York residents from participating the programs. \\nDHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling.\\nThe judge also took aim at Wolf\\'s status, writing: \"DHS\\'s decision (the \\'TTP Decision\\') was announced in a February 5, 2020 letter authored by Defendant Chad Wolf, purportedly the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security.\"\\nThe court uses the word \"purportedly\" because there is \"some doubt whether Wolf was then (and is now) lawfully exercising the authority of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security,\" according to the ruling. \\nThe Government Accountability Office found in an August report that the appointments of Wolf and Ken Cuccinelli, the top two leadership roles at DHS, were invalid. The department has disputed the GAO conclusion. \\nWolf is awaiting a possible Senate vote on his nomination to lead the department after the Senate Homeland Security Committee voted along party lines late last month to advance his nomination. \\nLast month, a federal judge in Maryland ruled that Wolf is likely unlawfully serving as acting secretary of the department. \\n\\n'},\n",

Census officials suspended the critical field work to knock on the doors of households that had not responded. \\nCensus officials said publicly this summer that meeting the December 31 deadline would be impossible while also producing an accurate count. President Donald Trump called for Congress to provide the Census Bureau extra time -- even more than the additional four months the administration officially proposed. \\nThen in late July and early August, Ross directed Census officials to come up with a plan to condense the door knocking operation, shorten the number-crunching process, and meet the December 31 deadline. Officials warned in internal emails reviewed by CNN that such a count would be of tally of \"unacceptable quality\" with \"fatal flaws\" and carry the stain of \"politically manipulated results.\"\\nIn one email, Ross asked if a shortened schedule would allow the numbers to be produced during Trump\\'s presidency. That suggested a concern that Republican leadership, rather than a potential Joe Biden presidency, make determinations over who is counted, while also risking a significant undercount of the population in as many as 10 states. \\nFederal Judge Lucy Koh ruled that plan was not well-reasoned and ordered the count to continue past September 30. She then blocked Ross\\' subsequent plan to conclude counting in early October, calling it an \"egregious violation\" of her earlier order and considering finding Ross in contempt of her directives. \\nAttorneys representing the National Urban League-led coalition suing the administration on Wednesday applauded the appellate court ruling that upheld much of Koh\\'s order and have not yet responded to the request that the Supreme Court take up the case. \\nThis story has been updated with additional background information.\\n\\n'},\n",

Also, many states have increased the requirements to sign up for or remain enrolled in Medicaid or the Children\\'s Health Insurance Program.\\nAnother factor: the \"chilling effect\" created by the administration\\'s efforts to curtail immigration, including the public charge rule, which makes it more difficult for immigrants who rely on public assistance, such as Medicaid, to obtain legal status.\\nHispanic children saw the biggest jump in their uninsured rate, which climbed to 9.2% in 2019, from 7.9% two years earlier. \\nThe share of uninsured children varies widely by state. Texas has the highest rate at 12.7% last year. The number of young Texans lacking coverage grew by 243,000 between 2016 and 2019, accounting for about one-third of nationwide increase.

But the report found that AFA\\'s activities far exceeded those of Stop Republicans, both in terms of money spent and impressions received.\\nWhile Facebook allows politicians to make false claims in their ads — arguing that voters deserve an unfiltered view of what candidates and elected officials say — advertisements by super PACs and other independent groups are subject to the company\\'s policies on misinformation.\\n\"We reject ads that include content which has been debunked on our platform by our fact-checking partners. We are reviewing these ads, which are now inactive, to determine if they should\\'ve been rejected,\" Andy Stone, a Facebook spokesman, told CNN Business after this article was originally published. \\nAccording to Avaaz\\'s findings, Stop Republicans spent $45,000 on 30 ads with misleading claims about the USPS beginning in late July, resulting in roughly 1 million ad impressions. America First Action pushed a far greater volume of misinformation, spending more than $287,000 on some 450 ads containing claims about Biden\\'s tax and immigration proposals that fact-checkers rated as false or misleading. The Republican-leaning ads in the study were viewed more than 9 million times. \\nThe Republican super-PAC also spent more money spreading false claims as a proportion of its overall Facebook spend, according to the study. Since May, America First Action has spent nearly $2.6 million on some 11,000 political Facebook ads; the $287,500 it spent on misleading ads represents 11% of its total spend since then.  \\nStop Republicans\\' misleading ads amounted to just 0.2% of its overall Facebook budget, largely because it is one of the biggest political spenders on Facebook advertising; since May, it has spent $19.7 million on some 3,000 political ads on the platform.   \\nAmerica First Action has close ties to President Donald Trump. Its chairwoman, Linda McMahon, is a former member of Trump\\'s cabinet, while its spokesperson, Kelly Sadler, formerly worked in the White House communications office.\\nStop Republicans appears to lack strong connections to Biden. Its executive director, Alex Morgan, was a volunteer for Jennifer Granholm\\'s 2002 campaign for Michigan governor. Harry Pascal, founder of Stop Republicans\\' parent organization, Progressive Turnout Project, has worked on a number of congressional campaigns. \\nStudying super PAC ads\\nAvaaz\\'s study looked at Democratic- and Republican-leaning super PACs identified by the Center for Responsive Politics, and also at the top-spending super PACs identified by Facebook\\'s ad transparency center. \\nThough Facebook had removed about 40 of the advertisements by the time Avaaz raised the alarm to internal company moderators this week, that represented less than 10% of the total identified by the group\\'s research. Avaaz said the ads were determined to be misleading based on fact-check articles published by Facebook\\'s own journalistic partners. \\nMany of the surviving ads were virtually identical to the ones Facebook took down, indicating that while the social media giant understands the content to be problematic, it is unable or unwilling to deal with it comprehensively across its platform, said Fadi Quran, campaign director at Avaaz. And, Quran added, it highlights how brazenly some advertisers flout Facebook\\'s policies, seemingly unafraid of a crackdown by the company.   \\n\"The objective question is, \\'Is Facebook as a platform protecting and informing US citizens during this election, or are its policies as they exist today causing more harm and allowing malicious users to weaponize it?\\'\" Quran said. \"Objectively trying to answer that question, our findings indicate Facebook could be doing so much more by applying its policies.\"  \\nIn a statement, Progressive Turnout Project said its ads are part of a campaign to support the Postal Service amid what it called an effort by Trump to sabotage the office.\\nSadler, the spokesperson for America First Action, objected to the conclusions of Facebook\\'s fact-checking partners and accused them of Democratic activism. \"Facebook\\'s fact-check policy is a joke,\" Sadler said in a statement to CNN. \"We will aggressively defend our First Amendment freedom, especially in this pivotal election year. We will not be censored by wannabe Democratic operatives posing as third-party arbiters of the truth.\"  \\nAmerica First Action has sent letters to Politifact and Factcheck.org, Sadler said, challenging their ratings. \\nMisleading ads on Biden\\nOne recent ad claimed that Biden \"will RAISE TAXES on all income groups\" and that \"no income group is safe\" — contrary to independent analyses that showed lower-income groups would largely be insulated from Biden\\'s tax plan. Biden\\'s plan would directly reduce the after-tax income of the top 1% of earners by between 13% and 18%, according to a CNN fact-check, while potentially and indirectly reducing the take-home pay of lower-income earners by 0.2% to 0.6%. \\nUSA Today, a Facebook fact-checking partner, said the claim that Biden\\'s plan would raise rates on taxpayers making $75,000 was false. While the ad\\'s claim may be technically true in that Americans in lower tax brackets could pay more in tax, it misrepresents the impact of Biden\\'s plan, which falls overwhelmingly on the rich.   \\nAnother ad by America First Action misleadingly asserts that Biden \"wants free health care and free tuition for all illegal immigrants.\" But Factcheck.org, a Facebook fact-checking partner, rated those claims as a distortion when Trump made them in a press conference earlier this year.   \\n\"Biden hasn\\'t proposed federal student aid and free community college for everyone who came, or comes, to the US illegally,\" Factcheck.org wrote in July. \"Biden\\'s education plan specifically says he would make so-called Dreamers eligible for federal financial aid if they otherwise meet the requirements. Dreamers are a specific group of individuals who are already in the country and were brought here illegally as children by their parents.\"  \\nFactcheck.org also clarified that Biden plans to offer undocumented immigrants the ability to \"buy into\" the US health care system under the Affordable Care Act, rather than giving all of them health care for free as the ad claimed.  \\nCNN\\'s own fact-checking has determined that Biden\\'s policy task forces \"are not proposing to create special benefits for undocumented immigrants.\"  \\nMisleading ads about the USPS\\nThe Democratic-leaning super PAC Stop Republicans, meanwhile, made definitive-sounding but misleading claims that the US Postal Service \"will be G-O-N-E by the end of the year\" unless Congress gives it more funding to adapt to the coronavirus pandemic. \\nA USA Today fact-check on a similar claim ruled that while the USPS faces a \"daunting financial situation,\" the likelihood of outright closure is remote. And a CNN fact-check rejected claims by some Democrats that a lack of funding could disrupt mail-in voting.  \\nProgressive Turnout Project said in a statement that the USA Today fact-check ran \"two months before Louis DeJoy became Postmaster General, three months before the postal crisis and the campaign to #SavethePostOffice this summer, and three months before the Stop Republicans ad was posted.\"\\nFacebook\\'s advertising policies explicitly ban ads \"containing claims which are debunked by third party fact checkers\" and warn that repeat offenders could face restrictions. The company exempts political candidates and their own campaigns from the policy, but super PACs, as independent organizations, would not be eligible for the loophole.   \\n\"Pages and websites that repeatedly share misinformation rated False or Altered will have some restrictions, including having their distribution reduced,\" Facebook\\'s policies say. \"They may also have their ability to monetize and advertise removed, and their ability to register as a news Page removed for a given time period.\"  \\nLack of repercussions\\nDespite the rules, the super PACs have not faced significant repercussions, said Avaaz, nor have users who engaged with the ads been notified that they have been exposed to misleading content.   \\nThe research comes as America First Action announced earlier this month it plans to spend $22 million on digital and TV ads in swing states in the run-up to the election, in addition to an $18 million ad blitz it announced in August.  \\n\"I consider it to be horrifying that the most vulnerable swing state voters that we have out there right now, whose decisions will determine the fate of the country, are being preyed upon by misinformation,\" said Nell Greenberg, campaign director at Avaaz.   \\nAlluding to claims of anti-conservative bias by Facebook, Greenberg added: \"Does it appear they\\'re applying their policies equally? They are equally ineffectively applying their policies.\"\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)Three years after its last edition, \"Fargo\" returns with Chris Rock and Jason Schwartzman in key against-type roles, and an enticing mob story with the texture of a graphic novel. Yet it unfolds at such a languid, almost hypnotic pace as to blunt its impact, getting distracted by an abundance of oddball characters that don\\'t overtly do much to advance the central plot.\\nThe FX series was one of many delayed by coronavirus, having completed nine of its 11 episodes before the pandemic shut down production. Series creator Noah Hawley and his team were able to resume filming, although those final episodes haven\\'t been seen, so even critics don\\'t know if the big build-up actually pays off in a satisfying manner.\\nAs is, the new \"Fargo\" owes a debt to every Mafia movie ever made, but perhaps foremost to the graphic-novel-turned-2002-movie \"Road to Perdition,\" at least in the look and tone. A key dramatic device also brings to mind Jack Kirby\\'s epic \"Fourth World\" comic books of the 1970s: Leaders of warring factions (and in that case, planets) swapping sons in order to maintain an uneasy truce between them.\\nThe premiere establishes that history, and indeed the entire arc of American organized crime as it pertains to immigrants, with the rise of Jewish, Irish and Italian syndicates -- whoever was \"next off the boat,\" it\\'s noted. These groups warily interact with each other, before Black mobsters enter the scene when the story begins in Kansas City in 1950, with Rock\\'s Loy Cannon as their boss. (Lest anyone have forgotten after the long layoff, \"Fargo,\" the title, is really just a state of mind, not the town referred to in the original Coen brothers movie.)\\n\"What does history tell us? Peace don\\'t last for long,\" the narration notes at the outset, setting an ominous tone for virtually everything that follows.\\nCannon trades his son with the rival Italian mob, run by Schwartzman\\'s slightly fidgety Josto Fadda, himself the product of an earlier heir swap. Yet Fadda has his own internal troubles, with his ruthless brother Gaetano (\"Gomorrah\\'s\" Salvatore Esposito) having come over from the old country and itching for a fight.\\n\"Fargo\" provides an assortment of lovingly constructed shots, artful split screens and eccentric characters, including Timothy Olyphant (not far from his \"Justified\" days) as a philosophical lawman who objects to strong language; Jessie Buckley as a nurse whose stiff outward demeanor doesn\\'t tell the whole story; and Ben Whishaw -- who really steals the show -- as an Irishman raised by the Italians, who becomes the world-weary chaperone of Cannon\\'s kid.\\nRock and Schwartzman sink their teeth into these serious dramatic roles, and there\\'s still plenty of the series\\' trademark quirkiness, such as naming one of Loy\\'s lieutenants Doctor Senator (played by the ever-reliable Glynn Turman).\\nToo often, though, the narrative moves at a crawl, filled with long conversations that carry the impending threat of violence. It\\'s fine if you\\'re there just to luxuriate in the atmosphere (which includes a glorious black-and-white episode later in the run), and a little frustrating if you\\'d prefer a bit more urgency about where all these roads lead and intersect.\\nGiven the spotty history of translating movies to TV, the first season of \"Fargo\" was a minor miracle -- capturing the film\\'s peculiar rhythms -- and the second was almost equally impressive. The third, however, featuring Ewan McGregor in a dual role, slipped from that creative plateau, and the fourth ranks right around that line, well below the show\\'s apex.\\nThat isn\\'t bad company, but in the \"Fargo\" pecking order, it\\'s closer to the runt of the litter than the top dog.\\n\"Fargo\" premieres Sept. 27 at 9 p.m. on FX and the next day on FX on Hulu.\\n\\n'},\n",

(Practically speaking, no.)\\nShould we pay attention to presidential polling? (Sure!)\\nWill the election be secure? (Election officials are working hard to make it so.)\\nOn CNN\\'s new Election 101 podcast, host Kristen Holmes will tackle your questions around the election, starting with voter registration. \\nHow do you register?\\n\"We don\\'t want it to be an onerous burdensome event,\" says Myrna Pérez, director of voting rights and elections at the Brennan Center for Justice. \\nShe explains that you can fill out a voter registration form that you will be able to find online via your secretary of state\\'s office or your local election office. \"Some states allow you to register online, which means you never have to fill out a paper form,\" she says. \"Some government offices like post offices or the library will have paper forms that you can fill out.\" \\nProspective voters should also check if you live in a state with Election Day registration, which means you can register that very day.\\nWhat are some of the challenges to voter registration?\\nPérez emphasizes that registering to vote should not be taken for granted.\\n\"I think we need to start off with the fact that this country has professed a right to vote, but through too much of our history, we have put barriers in front of the ballot box or affirmatively made it impossible for certain people to register and participate,\" she says.\\nIn fact, this step in our electoral process has a long, and at times dark, history. And that history can help us understand some of today\\'s voter registration issues. \\nIn 1776, John Adams wrote a letter stating that giving voting rights to certain groups of people was a \"dangerous\" idea. For almost 100 years, only White men with property were allowed to vote. \\nAs populations grew, polling officials had trouble figuring out who had the right to vote, so in 1800, Massachusetts became the first state to require voters to register. \\nHowever, new registration laws were introduced to keep other people out. In 1898, Louisiana changed its rules to block former slaves and their descendants from registering to vote. \\nAcross the South, literacy tests were part of the registration process, as a means of intimidating Black people, immigrants and those without financial means. In nearly a dozen southern states, people had to pay to register to vote -- a process known as poll taxes.\\nRules like this persisted throughout the Jim Crow era until 1965, when the Voting Rights Act was passed to prohibit voting discrimination. \\nHowever, even today, voting rights activists warn of continued barriers to registration like proof of citizenship requirements. Meanwhile, there are citizens with past criminal convictions who are unable to participate.\\nWill the pandemic affect your ability to register to vote?\\n\"The pandemic has laid bare many of the cracks in our election system,\" according to Pérez.\\nWith so many relocations associated with Covid-19, many are finding themselves unexpectedly having to update their voter registration records. Pérez points out that many states have residency requirements that require residents to have lived in the area for a certain period of time before they are eligible to vote there. DMVs, which have long been associated with voter registration, may offer limited hours or have long lines. \\nHowever, Pérez is hopeful. \"We are a strong people,\" she says. \"We are people that believe in our fundamental right to vote and trying to make sure that our democracy is inclusive.\"\\nTo hear the latest episodes of the Election 101 podcast, subscribe on iHeart Radio, Apple Podcasts, or wherever you get podcasts.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump on Saturday announced he is nominating Judge Amy Coney Barrett to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court in a flag-bedecked ceremony at the White House Rose Garden. \\nIf confirmed, Barrett, a conservative jurist appointed by Trump in 2017 to the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals, will certainly tilt the high court further rightward for years to come.  \\nHere are some of Barrett\\'s most notable writings:\\nSecond Amendment\\nIn 2019, Barrett dissented alone when a 7th Circuit panel majority rejected a Second Amendment challenge from a man found guilty of felony mail fraud and prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal and Wisconsin law.\\n\"History is consistent with common sense: it demonstrates that legislatures have the power to prohibit dangerous people from possessing guns,\" she wrote in Kanter v. Barr, applying an originalist approach that looked to the 18th-century intentions. \"But that power extends only to people who are dangerous. Founding legislatures did not strip felons of the right to bear arms simply because of their status as felons.\"\\nRELATED: Amy Coney Barrett, a proven conservative with a compelling personal story\\nBarrett concluded, \"Holding that the ban is constitutional ... does not put the government through its paces, but instead treats the Second Amendment as a second-class right.\"\\nPublic charge\\nIn June, Barrett dissented as a 7th Circuit panel left intact a US district court decision temporarily blocking a Trump policy that disadvantaged green card applicants who apply for any public assistance. In dispute were federal immigration regulations regarding when an applicant would be deemed a \"public charge\" and ineligible for permanent status in the US.\\nIn her dissent, Barrett wrote that the Trump administration\\'s interpretation of the relevant \"public charge\" law was not \"unreasonable.\" \\n\"At bottom, the plaintiffs\\' objections reflect disagreement with this policy choice and even the statutory exclusion itself. Litigation is not the vehicle for resolving policy disputes. Because I think that DHS\\'s definition is a reasonable interpretation of the statutory term \\'public charge,\\' I respectfully dissent,\" she wrote. \\nThe 7th Circuit majority in Cook County v. Wolf countered that Barrett\\'s construction failed to take account of the immigrants who would \"bear the brunt of the\" new rule.\\nAbortion \\nIn 2018, when the full 7th Circuit declined to reconsider a dispute over an Indiana abortion regulation requiring that the post-abortion fetal remains be cremated or buried, Barrett dissented with fellow conservatives. They began by focusing on a more contentious provision that had been earlier invalidated and not subject to the appeal.\\nThat provision made it unlawful for physicians to perform an abortion because of the race, sex or disability of the fetus. Barrett joined a dissent written by Judge Frank Easterbrook referring to the law as a \"eugenics statute.\" \\n\"None of the Court\\'s abortion decisions holds that states are powerless to prevent abortions designed to choose the sex, race, and other attributes of children,\" the dissent added.\\nAffordable Care Act\\nIn an early 2017 law review essay, reviewing a book related to the Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act, Barrett criticized Chief Justice John Roberts\\' rationale that saved the law in 2012.\\n\"Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute,\" Barrett wrote. \"He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power.\"\\nAt another point, Barrett refers to \"Roberts\\' devotion to constitutional avoidance.\"\\nThe court is scheduled to take up the latest challenge to Obamacare on November 10.\\nThis story has been updated with additional developments. \\nCNN\\'s Ariane de Vogue and Dan Berman contributed to this report.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)President Donald Trump\\'s reelection campaign\\'s early, aggressive play to cut into Democrats\\' advantage with Latino voters has Democratic elected officials and operatives concerned that a softening of support from the group could be decisive in November\\'s election.\\nDespite a message many say resonates with Spanish-speaking voters, those officials and operatives say Joe Biden\\'s presidential campaign has been slow to commit the needed resources and time to at least match where Hillary Clinton finished with the key demographic in 2016.\\nA string of polls shows Trump has increased his standing with Hispanic voters over the last four years. Although the President is still trailing heavily -- an analysis by CNN\\'s Harry Enten found Biden is winning Hispanic voters by 28 percentage points -- Biden is underperforming Clinton, who led by 37 percentage points in an average of final pre-election polls.\\nThe narrowing gap with Latinos is putting more pressure on Biden to hold or even expand his lead with White and older voters, two blocs with whom the Democrat has cut into Trump\\'s lead, allowing him to maintain an overall lead in national polling and crucial states, like Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.\\nView Trump and Biden head-to-head polling.\\nAsked why his numbers among Hispanic voters are as low as they are right now, Biden said on Monday that his number are much higher than Trump\\'s, but added, \"But they gotta go higher.\"\\nSome Democrats, concerned that Biden\\'s advantage with White voters could narrow, believe he needs to dial up his focus -- and dedicate more resources -- toward targeting the diverse array of Latino voters in key states like Florida, Nevada and Arizona that could tip the balance for the former vice president and win him the White House in November.\\n\"Any movement of White swing voters regressing to the mean, or any downtick of support from White swing voters for Biden, and (his) not doing the work to continue to increase support and run up the score with Hispanic voters in these key states could amount to a closer election than we would be comfortable with,\" said Stephanie Valencia, co-founder of EquisLabs and Barack Obama\\'s deputy Latino vote director in 2008.\\nRepublicans start by asking\\nThe fight for Hispanic voters was on full display this week, with Trump courting voters in Nevada and Arizona as Biden headlined a Hispanic Heritage Month event in central Florida.\\nTrump and his campaign have made a concerted effort to right their messaging wrongs of four years ago and close the gap with Hispanic voters using a three-pronged approach: Tie Biden to the left wing of his party in an effort to win over immigrants from authoritarian socialist countries; promise economic growth and low taxes to the sizable pool of Hispanic Americans starting small businesses; and pledge to combat gang activity in big cities in an effort to win over older Hispanic voters.\\nMuch of this activity has flown under the national radar and comes packaged with a lighter touch than Trump delivers in his speeches and tweets. The candidate who began the 2016 campaign by calling undocumented Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and oversaw a regime that separated migrant families at the US-Mexico border, has not -- rhetorically or with policy -- backed off his hardline approach. But his campaign is betting that Hispanic voters, especially those who don\\'t follow the news closely or haven\\'t been negatively impacted by his administration\\'s actions, will focus instead on his economic messaging and be scared off by the campaign\\'s false attacks on Biden.   \\n\"I have been in Republican politics for a long time and this is really the first presidential campaign where I have seen major investment into Latino outreach,\" said Mercedes Schlapp, a top Trump operative who was born in Florida and is Cuban American. \"Republicans for a long time really have been hesitant to break into the Latino community and black community and court that vote.\"\\nThis messaging, said top Democrats working in Latino communities, has made a difference for Trump. But the biggest impact, operatives said, was the fact that Trump seemingly dominated messaging in key states like Florida for months, with Biden ceding the floor to Trump.\\nLorella Praeli, president of Community Change Action and Clinton\\'s national Latino vote director in 2016, said it was a \"mistake\" that Biden has not started his outreach earlier, but the mere fact that Biden\\'s outreach took time to ramp up should not dissuade the campaign from committing substantial resources now.\\n\"We should not get cynical about the moment and the opportunity we have in front of us,\" said Praeli. \"In the last 50 days, you can persuade the electorate. ... Should you have been making those inroads earlier? Yes. Is it too late? No. But don\\'t sleep on it now simply because you didn\\'t start earlier.\"\\nBoth Democratic and Republican strategists also argued that, on a range of issues, the Latino community -- whether it\\'s Cuban Americans in South Florida, Puerto Ricans in Orlando, or Mexican immigrants in border states out West -- should not be viewed as separate from the rest of the electorate. \\nTrump\\'s primary focus might be ginning up White resentment, they said, but he also taps into other unsavory instincts in the American voting public -- especially among men.\\n\"What appeals to Latino voters who are supporting Trump is the same thing that appeals to voters who support Trump,\" said Sonja Diaz, founding director, Latino Policy & Politics Initiative, UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, and a former policy counsel to Sen. Kamala Harris during the vice presidential candidate\\'s time as California attorney general.   \\n\"It\\'s likely that Latino males will support Trump in 2020 at higher rates than Latinas. And you see that generally in terms of the trends of White voters and White males in particular,\" Diaz said. \"I think that there\\'s something around masculinity and misogyny that is really galvanizing some voters who identify as men. And I don\\'t know that there is a cultural component to it. It\\'s just an American male phenomenon.\"\\nBiden ramping up outreach\\nBiden\\'s campaign contends that they are making significant investments in courting Latino voters, including hiring targeted vote directors in 11 states, using Latino-run mail and polling firms to court voters, and running micro-targeted, bespoke ads that employ Mexican accents in Arizona, Cuban accents in Miami and Puerto Rican accents in Orlando and Tampa.\\nAnd the overarching issue facing the community right now, said Julie Chavez Rodriguez, a Biden campaign deputy campaign manager, is the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\\n\"The devastation that the community has seen both from a public health perspective and an economic perspective is one that has drastically impacted Latino voters in all of the battle ground states,\" said Chavez Rodriguez. \"The reality is over 25,000 Latinos have lost their lives as a result of Covid. The numbers didn\\'t have to be that high. ... Those are the realities that I think Latinos are facing today.\"\\nThe campaign is also working to combat election disinformation, with organizers reporting that an array of wild, false conspiracy theories are being directed at Spanish-speaking voters, especially in battle ground Florida.\\nRodriguez said that the campaign is \"seeing voter suppression at a whole new level,\" so while the Trump campaign is actively reaching out to Latino voters, others are working to \"keep folks from actually engaging in a critical election that has a huge impact.\"\\n\"It is really disturbing that some of those tactics are being used,\" she said\\nBut even Democrats close to Biden concede that it took the campaign a long time -- because of the spread of the coronavirus and the campaign\\'s money issues early in the general election -- to commit the needed resources to Latino outreach.\\nArizona Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Biden supporter and surrogate, said that he spoke to Biden about the initial lack of Hispanic outreach and the former vice president acknowledged that his team had been slow out of the gate.\\n\"The Biden campaign would admit they were slow to get out to Latinos communities. It is not because they didn\\'t want to, it is because when they captured the nomination, the country had to shut down and they were broke, too,\" Gallego said. But now, he added, \"I have never seen this amount of money spent on Spanish media, ever, in any election.\"\\nGallego admitted that Trump\\'s messaging works with some voters, but said that his focus on socialism, crime and the economy is all overshadowed by the President\\'s disastrous handling of the coronavirus.\\n\"You can\\'t talk about jobs when we have the highest rate of unemployment in the country right now,\" Gallego said. \"For the Latino community, when things go bad in the country, we are the first ones down the rabbit hole and the last ones out of the hole. That\\'s what is happening with coronavirus.\"\\nAttacks on Biden \\nChuck Rocha, who led Sen. Bernie Sanders\\' lauded Latino outreach efforts and since launched Nuestro PAC, which is now seeking to drive turnout in November, said Biden\\'s message isn\\'t the problem. From what he\\'s seen in focus groups, he said, it goes down well. His concern, though, is whether the information is being hammered home with enough resources.\\n\"They like his message -- when you tell them. His economic message resonates dramatically with Latinos,\" Rocha said. \"He helped rebuild the economy. They love that. That means that they feel he can rebuild after coronavirus. He\\'s talked about raising the minimum wage. He\\'s talking about getting the economy back up and rolling. But all they really ever knew about him is that he was Barack Obama\\'s vice president and they just don\\'t know him.\"\\nThe information gap, Rocha added, has been exploited by the Trump campaign -- as seen on television, most prominently during the Republican National Convention, when Trump made a series of appeals to persuadable Latino voters. \\nBiden\\'s issues with the Latino vote are most acute in Florida, where about a third are typically conservative-leaning Cuban Americans. Trump\\'s attempts to portray Biden as a tool of the radical left might not resonate broadly, but in a state where so many Latino voters, especially older ones, are sensitive to even the whiff of socialism, Biden\\'s position as the de facto leader of an increasingly progressive Democratic Party has the potential turn off voters.\\nA Marist College poll released earlier this month found Biden and Trump tied at 48% among likely voters in Florida. The same poll found the President narrowly leading the former vice president among Latinos in the state, with Trump at 50% and Biden at 46%. Other polls, like a Monmouth University poll released this week found Biden with a substantial lead over Trump among Latino voters -- 58% to 32%.\\nDespite the variability in polls among Hispanic voters, Republicans believe that those polls show Trump\\'s focus on socialism is working.\\n\"Biden is kind of caught in the middle,\" said Chris Hartline, a top aide to Republican Florida Sen. Rick Scott, the state\\'s former two-term governor. \"Obviously he is, at least in tone and personality, more moderate. And probably on policy, as well. But he\\'s caught in the middle of wanting of trying to hold together the two sides of the Democratic Party.\"\\nBiden, in an attempt to keep the party together, has worked closely with some of the Democratic leaders, like Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who co-chaired a post-primary unity task for on climate. Hartline said it makes sense that Biden is not going to \"denounce\" some of the more progressive views in his party.\\nBut, he added, \"folks in South Florida recognize that and see what socialism has done in their countries. And they don\\'t want a president who is the leader of a party that is flirting with that sort of ideology.\"\\nBiden and his campaign have mostly laughed off the socialism charges, when leveled against him personally, viewing them as self-evidently false. Valencia said that is probably the right strategy, especially in Florida, a TV-driven state with a diverse Latino population.\\n\"We are gaining every day with Latino voters. It is pre-election, so there are a lot of undecided voters. But that is not a surprise or a controversy,\" said Matt Barreto, a Biden pollster focused on Latinos. \"Historically, those undecided voters are younger and more Democratic leaning and have voted for Democrats 2-to-1 in the past. ... We are on track and will continue to go after every single Latino vote.\"\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Kyle Meyaard-Schaap is national organizer and spokesperson for Young Evangelicals for Climate Action. He is ordained in the Christian Reformed Church in North America and is a Public Voices Fellow of the Op-Ed Project and the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\\n (CNN)Much of the American West is on fire, Atlantic hurricanes have exhausted the alphabet two months early, and along the way climate change has once again muscled its way back into the national conversation. \\nFor this, we largely have young people to thank. Compounding natural disasters, staggering property damage and heart wrenching loss of life have flown too comfortably under the radar for years. Election cycle after election cycle passed by with barely a climate mention. Then the kids organized. Only now -- after millions of young people have been striking, sitting in and turning out to vote more than in the past -- is climate change a major election issue.\\nAmong this growing throng of youth climate activists are some you might not expect: young evangelical Christians. \\nThe organization I work with, Young Evangelicals for Climate Action, educates and mobilizes young evangelical Christians across the country to take action to address the climate crisis. Over the last several years, I have had hundreds of conversations with young Christians about how our faith should inform our pursuit of climate justice. A common narrative runs through almost every story I hear.\\nIt goes something like this. A young Christian is raised in a close family, is regularly involved in various church activities and often even attends a Christian K-12 school. She is taught values like compassion, love of neighbor and a high view of scripture. Yet, she is handed few tools for how these values should be brought to bear in the public square. Her political formation is uneven, mostly implicit and almost wholly yoked to Republican politics.\\nBecause no political party can completely capture the fullness of the values she was taught, her community\\'s embrace of partisan politics creates in her dissonance and disillusionment. The tension is most pronounced when it comes to issues that seem so clearly close to the heart of God -- like environmental protection and the humane treatment of refugees and immigrants -- yet seem so far from the political priorities of her community.\\nSometimes there is a breaking point. For many White evangelicals, it was the 2016 election when, according to Pew, eight in 10 of our parents, grandparents, classmates and neighbors voted for President Donald Trump. \\nCase in point: in 2017, I brought a group of 20 or so Christian college students to meet with staff in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\\'s office. When asked how many of them were Republican, student after student shared how they had grown up conservative and still held many conservative values but could not claim the Party because it had left them behind on climate change.\\nFor young Christians to say this inside the office of one of the most powerful Republicans in the country is significant. It is a direct challenge to the majority of leaders within institutional evangelicalism -- including many of our own pastors and denominational leaders -- who remain fully aligned with the Republican Party.\\nThe challenge of bringing our values to bear in the public square is nothing new, and it is not unique to Christians. We all possess nuanced values that do not fit neatly into the binary two-party system of modern American democracy. Yet for young evangelicals, this task is especially hard. It includes the potential for alienation from friends, family and worshiping communities. Psychology tells us what we all intuitively know: isolation from those we love is painful, and we avoid it if we can.\\nStill, many young people -- including some young evangelicals -- choose separation anyway because it is ultimately healthier and more sustainable. Many other young evangelicals are forging a new way forward by leaning into the evangelical tradition itself. \\nLike most of society, the US church is badly polarized. Political differences are driving a deeper and deeper wedge between the faithful in all major Christian traditions -- whether Catholic, mainline Protestant, or evangelical. Yet, the church is not merely one more social club filled with like-minded individuals. At its best, it is a community whose roots run deeper than politics. It is grounded in story -- both the big story of God\\'s saving work in the world and all the smaller stories of how God\\'s transforming power is showing up in the lives of God\\'s people. Telling these stories to one another and to the wider world is what many evangelical Christians call testimony.\\nYoung evangelicals across the US are harnessing the tradition of testimony in their communities to tell the story of how God is empowering them to address climate change as an act of love toward God\\'s world and toward their neighbors. They are grabbing microphones in front of their churches, leading Bible studies, navigating fraught holiday conversations and going out for coffee with their grandfather and his skeptical friends.  And it is changing hearts and minds.\\nThis \"in-house\" work is matched by young evangelicals\\' burgeoning climate activism in wider society. Young Christians are writing op-eds, marching in the streets, and meeting with their elected officials. Students are starting clubs on their Christian college campuses to educate and organize their peers, even transitioning to digital organizing and video group meetings in the era of Covid-induced distance-learning.\\nAnd this year, they are getting registered and making plans to vote. Republicans have been able to comfortably rely on evangelical votes for decades, largely by claiming the moral high ground on abortion. Abortion still factors significantly in the electoral calculations of many young evangelicals. Yet more and more, it is being incorporated into a more holistic ethic of life that recognizes climate change and the inhumane treatment of refugees -- among others -- as threats to the sacredness of life too.\\nCandidates and elected officials may want to take notice. Though our parents and grandparents have dictated evangelical political prerogatives in the past, Millennials and Gen Z are ascendant. Almost 40% of eligible voters in 2020 will belong to these 40-and-under generations, according to Pew. Also, according to Pew, among the quarter or so of all 2020 voters who will be evangelical, one-sixth of them could be younger than 30. In elections as close as November\\'s is shaping up to be, those margins can turn into landslides.\\nAnd even though younger voters have not historically turned out in the same numbers as our elders, that may be changing too. According to the Census Bureau, turnout among 18-29-year-olds jumped 79% between 2014 and 2018 and what my colleagues and I are seeing on the ground in our work points to a cohort that is unusually motivated to have their voices heard at the polls this year. This crop of young voters -- shaped by childhoods overshadowed by endless war, historic recessions and the existential threat of ecological collapse -- may be poised to become the exception that proves this rule.\\nIf so, count on young evangelicals to play our part, both in 2020 and beyond. We\\'ve grown weary of the current expression of evangelical politics, stoked by Trump\\'s Republican Party, that seeks to convince us that faithful civic engagement is a black and white, \"us vs. them\" proposition where danger to our way of life lurks around every corner and that our overriding political concern should be our own cultural power and comfort rather than advancing the good of our neighbors.\\nMany of our peers have simply left the evangelical tradition behind, fed up with how selfish some of the followers of our famously selfless Savior have become. Those of us who remain are fashioning a new way forward. One steeped in evangelical values, marked by unapologetic testimony, and shaped by a holistic ethic of life that understands climate chaos, the abuse of immigrants, the demonization of our LGBTQ neighbors and the termination of unborn life as equal assaults on the image of God.\\nAnd we\\'re voting like it.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Errol Louis is the host of \"Inside City Hall,\" a nightly political show on NY1, a New York all-news channel. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\\n (CNN)A little more than an hour after President Trump, infected with the coronavirus, made a rash and reckless return to the White House, Democratic challenger Joe Biden made clear at a televised NBC town hall why he is leading Trump in every national poll and in most top battleground states as well.\\nThe leading issue in the November 3 election is the federal response to Covid-19. Biden has checkmated Trump on the issue. \\nEven as the President\\'s close allies and advisers turn up sick after ignoring social distancing and mask-wearing best practices -- including his campaign manager, press secretary and three Republican senators -- Trump has chosen to double down on a failed strategy of downplaying the importance of the pandemic, tweeting, \"Don\\'t be afraid of Covid. Don\\'t let it dominate your life.\"\\n \\nAmericans have seen the effects of the pandemic, which has killed more than 210,000 people, shut down entire school systems, triggered a global food crisis and resulted in the highest unemployment rates since the Great Depression. And they have the good sense to be afraid.\\n \\nTrump\\'s wildly irresponsible advice -- \"don\\'t let it dominate your life\" -- plays right into Biden\\'s strategy of offering the nation a calm, sensible and presidential alternative by simply acknowledging reality.  At a time when the nation\\'s leader seems lost in a fog of claims that he might be immune to the virus and unfounded predictions that the pandemic would simply disappear, Biden gets a big head start by following basic public health precautions and urging voters to do the same.\\n \\nThus, shortly after Trump ginned up a media spectacle of checking himself out of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and posing, maskless, on a balcony overlooking the South Lawn of the White House, Biden was imploring voters to take the deadly pandemic seriously.  \"I hope nobody walks away thinking it\\'s not a problem,\" he said of Trump\\'s tweet. \"It\\'s a serious problem.\"\\nAnd when asked about Trump contracting Covid-19 after months of sowing confusion about the virus, Biden surely must have got heads nodding all over America by simply acknowledging the truth. \"210,000 have died already. And the expectation is, if nothing changes, another 200,000 dead by the end of the year,\" he said.  \"That\\'s 400,000 -- God forbid it that happens -- more than were killed in one year in America than four years in World War II.\"\\n \\nBiden\\'s coronavirus plan -- which includes requiring social distancing and mask-wearing on all federal property, making testing universally available and following the advice of scientists -- is simple common sense. But compared to Trump\\'s wild carelessness, common sense sounds like deep wisdom.\\n \\nNBC anchor Lester Holt, who hosted the event, said that Trump, like Biden, has been invited to talk with voters in a town hall, but the Trump campaign has not agreed to participate. That speaks volumes about what\\'s likely to happen if Trump is well enough for the candidates meet for their next official debate, which will be a town hall. \\nBiden excels at the format, using jokes and personal anecdotes to connect with everyday voters. It\\'s a world away from Trump\\'s preferred campaign style of flying into a city and holding forth to hollering crowds at an arena or airport hangar. \\n \\nTrump uses his speeches to lavish praise on himself, while Biden talks about his working-class upbringing and his wife\\'s career as a public school teacher. Trump never misses an opportunity to slash at enemies -- Democrats, looters, immigrants, radicals -- while Biden talks hopefully about unifying the nation.\\n \\n\"The country is ready to be united, I believe,\" he told a voter at the town hall. \"We have to just change the way we talk to each other. Politics has become so mean and so ugly. We\\'ve gotta get rid of that. We gotta just start talking to each other like we respect each other.\"\\n \\nAt a town hall, it won\\'t be easy for Trump to interrupt and talk over voters, the way he did with Biden and the moderator in their first debate.  Confronted with the real needs of ordinary Americans, Trump will be forced into the uncomfortable position of explaining why he has denied and denigrated scientific knowledge at every stage of the pandemic. \\n \\nHe\\'ll also have to answer the question on everybody\\'s mind: with hundreds of people dying every day, how can we trust you to keep the country safe from Covid when you couldn\\'t even protect yourself from it?\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'London (CNN Business)Japan has the oldest population in the world, and that\\'s causing an acute labor shortage. With almost a third of the population aged 65 and above, finding workers can be a challenge.\\nIncreasingly, companies are turning to technology as a solution — including two of the biggest convenience store franchises in Japan, FamilyMart and Lawson.\\nThis week, Lawson deployed its first robot in a convenience store, in Tokyo. FamilyMart trialled the same robots last month, and says it plans to have them working in 20 of its stores by 2022. \\nBoth chains are deploying a robot named Model-T, developed by Japanese startup Telexistence. Seven feet tall when extended to its full height, the robot moves around on a wheeled platform and is kitted out with cameras, microphones and sensors. Using the three \"fingers\" on each of its two hands it can stock shelves with products such as bottled drinks, cans and rice bowls.\\n\"It is able to grasp, or pick and place, objects of several different shapes and sizes into different locations,\" Matt Komatsu, head of business development and operations at Telexistence, tells CNN Business. \\nThis sets it apart from other robots used in stores, such as those used by Walmart to scan shelf inventory, or the ones used in warehouses to stack boxes. Warehouse robots \"pick up the same thing from the same place and place it on the same platform — their movement is very limited compared to ours,\" says Komatsu.\\nRemote control\\nThe Model-T robot — named after the Ford automobile that pioneered assembly line production in the early 20th Century — is controlled by shop staff remotely. A human \"pilot\" wears a virtual reality (VR) headset and special gloves that let them \"feel\" in their own hands the products the robot is holding. Microphones and headphones allow them to communicate with people in the store.\\nTelexistence does not plan to sell the robots and VR systems directly to stores, but will provide them for a fee. It would not disclose the price but said it would be cost-competitive with human labor. \\nIn theory, the robot could be controlled from anywhere in the world, says Komatsu. During a trial in August at a FamilyMart store in Tokyo, the pilot operated the robot from a VR terminal at the Telexistence office around five miles away. \\nThis makes recruitment easier and offers potential for hiring overseas in places with lower labor costs, says Komatsu. He adds that controlling the robot is straightforward and would not require skilled pilots.\\nStores would also be able to operate with fewer workers. \"A remote-controlled robot allows one person to work at multiple stores,\" says Satoru Yoshizawa, a representative of FamilyMart.\\nYoshizawa says that many of the company\\'s stores find it especially difficult to hire people for short periods of three to five hours a day for shelf stacking. With a robot, they could employ a single operator to work across multiple stores, and focus on hiring humans to work at cash registers, he says. \\nLawson faces the same problem. \"We have been trying to solve the labor shortage in some of our stores and through this experiment we are going to examine how the robots will help,\" Ken Mochimaru, of Lawson\\'s corporate communications division, tells CNN Business. \\nIf it proves effective, he says that Lawson will consider rolling out the robots across more of its branches. \\nCompared to other countries, Japan\\'s labor shortage means there\\'s less concern that the deployment of robots will result in human job losses. Prior to Covid-19, according to a 2020 report by management consulting firm McKinsey, Japan was on track to automate 27% of existing work tasks by 2030. Although that could replace the jobs of some 16 million people, the report said, it would still leave the country short of 1.5 million workers. \\nImmigration could also help to fill the shortfall. The government has made some moves to open up Japan to foreign workers, but experts argue that Japan lags behind other industrialized countries in extolling the benefits of immigrants to its population.  \\nGee Hee Hong, an economist at the International Monetary Fund, tells CNN Business that immigration is unlikely to rise enough to compensate for the aging population anytime soon.\\nEmbracing \"labor-saving technology\" is part of the solution, says Hong, but she adds that there are still hurdles to overcome before the widespread adoption of robots in daily life. Japan will need to work out a \"legal framework for the use of such technologies alongside the general population,\" she says, including consumer protection and data protection.\\nShe adds that there needs to be \"strong and effective social nets\" in place to minimize negative impacts on unskilled workers.\\nCovid-19 accelerating automation\\nThe pandemic has boosted interest in automation, one reason being that robots could help to reduce human-to-human contact. Komatsu says that Telexistence has received increased interest from potential partners and customers. \\nHowever, the Model-T robot still has a way to go before it operates to the same standard as a human worker. It takes the robot eight seconds to put one item on a shelf, whereas it takes around five seconds for a human to do the same. So far, the bot can only handle packaged products, not loose bakery items or fruits and vegetables. \\nTelexistence, which launched in 2017, is working to improve these limitations. Using AI, the company hopes to teach the robot to copy human movements automatically, so that it can operate without a pilot.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'San Francisco (CNN Business)All eyes may be on TikTok this weekend as the Trump administration blocks it from app stores, but there\\'s another big Chinese-owned app that will suffer a similar — if not worse — fate. \\nWeChat, owned by China\\'s Tencent (TCEHY), will also no longer be available on US app stores after Sunday night, according to Department of Commerce officials. That means, like TikTok, it cannot be downloaded, and while people who already have the app may continue to use it, they won\\'t be able to receive future updates or security patches. \\nAdditionally, companies that make up the backbone of the internet, such as web hosting services and server networks, will be prohibited from hosting or carrying WeChat internet traffic from Sunday onwards, the Department of Commerce said in a release. The order doesn\\'t impact home and wireless internet providers, Commerce officials told CNN Business, so existing WeChat users can continue using the app but may face some outages as a result of the hosting restrictions.\\n\"Given that WeChat is heavily reliant on content delivery services in the United States to optimize the app — to make sure content can be delivered with necessary speeds — by prohibiting those services, users will experience some dysfunction and latency to the point there will be an outage or a message will time out,\" said one of the officials. \"We do expect it may be useable, but it may not be particularly functional after Sunday.\"\\nTikTok will not face those restrictions until November 12, the deadline set by President Trump\\'s executive order last month calling for the short-form video app to completely divest its US business. \\nTencent said it was \"reviewing\" the Commerce Department\\'s announcement and has held \"extensive discussions\" in recent weeks seeking to address the US government\\'s concerns. Trump has made no demand for a sale or any other specific action, leaving no clear path to any resolution. \\n\"WeChat was designed to serve international users outside of mainland China and has always incorporated the highest standards of user privacy and data security,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement. \"The restrictions announced today are unfortunate, but... we will continue to discuss with the government and other stakeholders in the U.S. ways to achieve a long-term solution.\"\\nWeChat is hugely popular in the United States, particularly among the Chinese-American community who use it to stay in touch with relatives in China.\\nThe app is common among older generations of immigrants who left China decades ago but want to stay connected. And during the pandemic, when traveling to China is complicated, expensive and involves an extra period in quarantine, many are staying put, making WeChat even more essential.\\nWeChat has been downloaded a total of 22 million times in the United States since January 2014, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower, accounting for around 7% of the app\\'s total downloads outside of China in that period. Sensor Tower estimates that 1.1 million first-time users have downloaded WeChat so far this year.\\nTencent has previously emphasized that the international version of WeChat is separate from the Chinese app, which is known as Weixin.\\nAnalysts and experts have also questioned whether US officials would force Apple (AAPL) to remove WeChat and Weixin from its Chinese app store. Such a move would deal a big blow to Apple and other US companies operating in China, where Weixin has become a daily necessity for hundreds of millions of people who use it to pay for goods, hail rides, order food, pay bills and more.\\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives said that it is unlikely the US ban will hit the Apple App Store in China. (Google\\'s Play Store is banned in China.)\\n\"Despite the noise, based on our recent discussions with contacts within [Washington] we strongly believe the WeChat ban will not negatively impact or disrupt Apple\\'s iPhone ecosystem within the key China market,\" Ives wrote in a note last week.\\nCNN\\'s Brian Fung, Kaya Yurieff, Sherisse Pham and Shannon Liao contributed to this report.\\n\\n'},\n",

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.\\n (CNN)Not all heroes wear a cape; some wear a robe.\\nWhen the nation lost Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on September 18, we lost an American heroine whose superpower was harnessing the law to protect millions of women, members of the LGBTQ community, people of color and those with disabilities. \\n \\nWe are living in a moment of deep uncertainty -- one in which countless people in America know that equal justice is still an aspiration, and it feels like we are regressing as a nation. And for good reason: President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are seemingly committed to rolling back progress on civil rights and blunting the positive change so many Americans seek. And they are doing this in part by reshaping the federal judiciary.\\n \\nThe Senate\\'s dereliction of duty to the people in this country is reprehensible. The governing body has failed to hold a vote on the HEROES Act, much-needed Covid-19 relief passed by the House of Representatives this spring, even as more than 200,000 lives have been lost in America. And yet McConnell is prioritizing holding hearings and voting on a third Trump-appointed Supreme Court justice without knowing for certain who the nominee will be. \\n \\nThe message is clear: Republican senators couldn\\'t care less about which of Trump\\'s nominees is selected. They already know the agenda he or she is likely to bring to the bench. \\n \\nAnd the stakes could not be higher. Trump and McConnell have been intent on stripping away health care for millions of people -- and that dream could become a reality, as the Court is set to decide the fate of the Affordable Care Act this term. In fact, the justices are scheduled to hear arguments on that issue right after Election Day. \\n \\nIn addition, in recent years, the Supreme Court has delivered a number of historic victories for the LGBTQ community. Justice Ginsburg stood on the right side of history each time. With several cases already in the pipeline, including a hospital denying gender-affirming care to transgender people and a business\\'s refusal to sell flowers to a same-sex couple for their wedding, more cases about LGBTQ equality are likely to reach the Supreme Court. Decades of hard-fought progress made by the LGBTQ movement could be threatened if Trump gets a third justice. \\nThe fate of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is also likely on the line. The past term, the Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration\\'s attempt to end this critical program for immigrants brought to the United States as children -- by one vote. And the Trump administration has already begun to set the stage for another legal battle to end these protections for good.\\n \\nRepublicans have also weaponized the Court against voting rights. In 2013, five justices declared the heart of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 unconstitutional, effectively paving the way for many of the barriers to the ballot box we are witnessing today. From strict voter ID laws to polling places closures in Black and brown neighborhoods to mandates that people who have committed felonies pay outstanding fines and fees before being allowed to vote, these barriers undermine our democracy.\\nDuring the 2020 election season, the Supreme Court has let stand numerous state laws that have disenfranchised communities of color. Those include finding that Wisconsin should not have extended its deadline for absentee voting during the Covid-19 crisis and declining to reinstate a ruling that would have allowed all Texas voters to submit ballots by mail due to the pandemic. Many more cases are in the pipeline. \\n \\nIn addition, Trump explicitly promised to appoint Supreme Court justices who would \"automatically\" overturn Roe v. Wade. More than a dozen challenges to abortion access could reach the Supreme Court -- and one of Trump\\'s shortlisters has come out unfavorably on some of them. With one potential nominee subscribing to the anti-reproductive rights movement, Trump\\'s appointee may try to gut or overturn this landmark decision. This will vastly diminish the ability of people to safely exercise control of their bodies. \\nTrump has outlined specifically what he hopes his nominee will do. Almost every person on his short list has a background that tells us we must believe him. Much has been said about Senate Republicans and their transparent hypocrisy. But their recent about-face on whether a Supreme Court nominee should be appointed and confirmed in a presidential election year reveals a stark reality: Nothing is more important to them than consolidating their power. And to do so, they are willing to destroy our democratic norms and processes along the way.  \\nPart of Justice Ginsburg\\'s great legacy is reminding us that the Supreme Court belongs to all of us -- and not to one party or politician. And right now, many of the rights and freedoms we cherish are on the line as the Trump administration challenges this simple truth. \\nLet\\'s fight Trump\\'s nominee like our lives depend on it -- because they do. For those who are outraged, let us channel that anger in two ways: Demand the Senate not confirm any nominee until after inauguration, and make sure you and everyone you know is voting this year to hold elected officials accountable. Voting is the language of democracy and, this year, we can\\'t leave anything on the table to save it.\\n \\n\\n'},\n",

As the debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris got underway on Wednesday, we took a look back.\\nAdm. James Stockdale was an American hero; he was shot down over North Vietnam, beaten while in prison and emerged as a talisman to fellow prisoners including the late Republican Sen. John McCain. But he is fated to be remembered by his iconic opening line in the 1992 vice presidential debate, when he ran on the ticket of Texas billionaire and independent candidate Ross Perot. Stockdale didn\\'t seem to have much clue why he was onstage, an impression underscored by his opening line (intended as an introduction): \"Who am I? Why am I here?\"\\nIn 2008, Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden was handed the difficult task of slowing the momentum of McCain\\'s running mate, Sarah Palin, who had emerged as a hero of the conservative movement. Any slight that could have been perceived as sexist from Biden would have been a gift for the GOP campaign. In the event, Biden handled things smoothly. But the debate is now most remembered for Palin\\'s greeting: \"Can I call you Joe?\"\\nFour years later, Biden was called upon to restore the morale of the Obama campaign at a moment when it seemed that Mitt Romney might just make his boss a one-term President. Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan came loaded for bear. But Biden charmed away his attacks all night with a flashing, toothy smile, mocking his opponent\\'s jabs as \"a bunch of malarkey.\" Ryan didn\\'t do too badly, though -- he later became speaker of the House.\\nBut for the Daddy of all counterpunches, we have to go back to 1988, when grizzled political veteran Lloyd Bentsen, running on the Democratic ticket of Michael Dukakis, delivered one of the greatest zingers in the history of political debates anywhere. Onstage, youthful Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle, the running mate of George H.W. Bush, compared his own experience to that of John F. Kennedy when he sought the presidency.  Bentsen -- pausing for a moment for dramatic effect -- then delivered the immortal, if precooked, line: \"Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you\\'re no Jack Kennedy.\"\\nCult of K-A-M-A-L-A\\nVice presidential picks may capture a bit less limelight than their presidential counterparts, but some in India may have paid special attention to the debate between Pence and Harris, CNN\\'s Manveena Suri reports from Delhi.\\nHarris, the daughter of two immigrants, is the first Black woman and the first South Asian woman to appear on a major party\\'s presidential ticket, making her appearance on the veep debate stage Tuesday a major moment for multiple underrepresented communities in America -- and a neat foil to the anti-immigration and largely White administration that Pence represents.\\nOn social media and in campaign ads, Harris -- whose mother was born in Chennai -- has emphasized her family and experiences in India as formative influences. \"When I was a young girl visiting my grandparents in India, I\\'d join my grandfather and his buddies on their morning walk along the beach as they would talk about the importance of fighting for democracy and civil rights. Those walks made me who I am today,\" she wrote in one Instagram post.\\nIn response, the senator from California has found admirers not only in the Indian American community -- a growing political force -- but also in India, where some superfans are claiming her as one of their own on social media. \"The pride and kinship that my Chennai-born mom & her family in India (even though no one lives in Chennai anymore) feel for Kamala Harris because her mother was also from Chennai is so pure & infectious. I wish I could bottle the elation of my mom feeling seen for the first time,\" one woman tweeted. \"Suddenly half the residents of Chennai are related or acquainted to Kamala Harris,\" wrote another.\\nThere are even musical tributes. Earlier this month, a young musician, Kanishka Anand, created \"It\\'s me Kamala,\" a homemade music video that shows little interest in Harris\\' record as a politician but subs out the original lyrics of the pop synth hit \"Friends\" for proud references to her heritage, with lines like \"For loving dosa, I don\\'t feel guilty.\" Expect such supporters to be vigilant for any missteps in pronunciation or perceived slights from Pence on the debate stage. As Anand sings, \"You say I\\'m Comma-la. I say I\\'m Kamala. It\\'s just your craziness ... Want me to spell it out for you? K-A-M-A-L-A.\"\\n(Asked last year how she defines herself, given her Indian roots, Harris replied, \"Proud American.\")\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': \"Mark Zandi is chief economist of Moody's Analytics. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\\nMore than six months since the Covid-19 pandemic hit, the US economy remains in a bad place. One-fifth of American workers are either unemployed, too discouraged to look for work and thus are not counted as unemployed, have lost work hours or have suffered a pay cut because of the pandemic. Hope that the economy would come roaring back is fading. \\nVoters are wondering whether President Donald Trump or Vice President Joe Biden has the better plan to get the economy past the pandemic and back to full strength. Their plans couldn't be more different. Based on our analysis, Biden has it right, and Trump has it wrong.\\nTrump's plan is simple — double down on the policies he pursued in his first term. Because he thinks he fixed the economy prior to the pandemic, he thinks he can fix it again. The problem with this logic is that the economy was doing just fine when he took office. In the last three years of Obama's presidency, the economy created more jobs and unemployment fell more than in Trump's first three years.\\nThe President likes to point to the stock market as evidence that his economic policies are working. But credit for a rising market should go to the Federal Reserve, which slashed interest rates nearly to zero, and which has indicated that rates won't budge until the economy has fully recovered. \\nThe President nonetheless believes his economic policies were a success and we should expect more of the same in his second term. This means more tax cuts. Corporations and the well-to-do benefited most from the massive tax cuts Trump signed into law at the end of 2017, but some of those cuts expire soon, and he wants to make them permanent. \\nTrump will also likely resume his damaging tariff war with China, which he put on hold late last year with the so-called Phase One trade deal. Once the dust settles after the pandemic and it becomes obvious that the deal had little impact on Chinese behavior, the tariff wars will undoubtedly heat up again. Tensions with other trading partners will also remain high. Any improvement in the trade deficit between the United States and China since the trade war began has been offset by widening deficits between the United States and other nations. Global manufacturers have not meaningfully shifted their production back to the United States. Instead, they've moved to other countries, like Vietnam, with low production costs. Trump has focused his ire on nations with which the United States runs trade deficits, and that ire will continue in his next four years.\\nPresident Trump will also inevitably clamp down further on foreign immigration, which will weaken  longer-term economic growth. Immigration restrictions slow growth in both the labor force, which is problematic due to a potential decline in our working-age population, and labor productivity, since immigrants tend to be risk-takers who start new companies and fuel innovation.\\nBiden promises to implement the opposite of many of Trump's policies. He has pledged that he will continue to push the Chinese to abide by international trade laws, but he would do so by re-engaging with the World Trade Organization and implementing other multilateral strategies. Biden has talked about the possibility of recommitting to a modified Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement, with tougher labor and environmental provisions. \\nThe TPP was the deal between the United States and other Pacific Rim nations that excluded China, because that country didn't play fair. The Obama administration had agreed to the TTP, but Trump withdrew from it with one of his first executive orders. \\nBiden would also normalize foreign immigration, by granting Dreamers — undocumented residents brought here as children — citizenship, allowing refugees and asylum seekers to come to America and supporting the sweeping immigration reform legislation that nearly became law in Obama's second term.\\nTo realize his plans, Biden will aggressively ramp up government spending. He proposes big investments in infrastructure, including the usual emphasis on roads and bridges, but also clean energy and research and development, such as 5G, battery technology and artificial intelligence. Investments in education would also get a big boost, including early childhood education, free public college tuition for lower- and middle-income students and student loan debt relief. The social safety net would also get stronger, with more funds for health care, child and elder care, housing and Social Security.\\nTo help pay for this, Biden says he will increase taxes on corporations and the well-to-do, unwinding many of Trump's tax cuts. The Trump tax cuts haven't lifted business investment and economic growth much, certainly not to the extent he advertises, and thus any fallout from the higher taxes would be modest. Nor would there be much impact on the spending of wealthier households given their considerable savings.\\nBiden's government spending plan will result in bigger budget deficits. This would be a problem in most times, as it would result in higher interest rates that would undermine the benefits of the increased spending. But not now. Because if Biden wins the election, he will inherit an economy with extraordinarily high unemployment, ensuring that through much of his term the Fed will hold to near-zero interest rates. This is the time to run larger deficits to get the economy back to full employment as quickly as possible.\\nTrump and Biden could hardly be more different. This is especially clear when it comes to economic policy. Voters couldn't have a clearer choice.\\n\\n\"},\n",

They\\'re entertaining enough but not what you come to see.\\nGiven the startling events of the past week, however, the upcoming debate may get more scrutiny and interest.\\nThe hospitalization of President Donald Trump for Covid-19 and the advanced age of both presidential candidates (Trump is 74, Joe Biden is 77) has shined a light on how quickly the understudies could be thrust into the starring role. Trump\\'s illness has caused scholars and journalists to publicly explore the 25th Amendment to the Constitution -- and what happens when a President becomes incapacitated. \\nAnd that is the lens through which voters may view Vice President Mike Pence and California Sen. Kamala Harris when they take the stage in Utah Wednesday night. They will be performing the traditional role as advocates for their principals, for sure. But they also will be measured more seriously than in the past as potential presidents in their own right.\\nThe unique moment will be reflected, in part, by additional space on the stage between the candidates, due to the coronavirus precautions. And given Pence\\'s recent proximity to Trump and others who have been infected by Covid-19, both candidates presumably will do what Trump did not do last week -- get tested before the debate proceeds. The audience presumably will wear masks, something Trump\\'s entourage eschewed.\\nThe debate also will be historic in another respect, featuring the first woman of color ever to take the vice presidential debate stage. The contrast between Harris, a Californian and daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants, and Pence, a White evangelical former talk show host from Indiana, will define the great and growing cultural divide in our politics.\\nYou can bet that this will be more polite than the calamitous presidential debate last week, where insults flew and rules were shredded. Even if Pence and Harris were so inclined, the mash-up in Cleveland was so roundly panned by voters and commentators alike that no one is aching for a repeat performance. The President\\'s illness may also lower the temperature.\\nMore likely, Pence will deliver the PG version of Trump\\'s debate brief, argued with more finesse but still honing in on Biden as the vessel for the \"radical left.\" Expect familiar themes on issues like \"law and order\" but a greater emphasis on who is best suited to lead an economic recovery -- the one major issue on which Trump and Biden share about even support.\\nHarris will come to promote Biden and his plans, but Pence likely will try to use her support in the Senate for progressive wish list items like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal to define the ticket, forcing her to defend her past positions or embrace Biden\\'s more moderate take on them. Pence may press her on Biden\\'s record on race and her pointed attack on him during the first Democratic primary debate.\\nRenowned for her incisive questioning of Senate witnesses, Harris, a former prosecutor, knows how to argue a case. \\nEven before the President\\'s illness, Covid-19 and the administration\\'s handling of it were likely to be front and center on Wednesday. Pence has chaired the President\\'s coronavirus task force and will have to answer for the tumultuous and often contradictory path the President has taken in dealing with the virus.\\nBut Harris faces unique challenges posed by expectations and bias.\\nBiden profited from low expectations in the presidential debate, which were set in no small measure by Trump\\'s incessant \"Sleepy Joe\" trolling. It made Biden\\'s job easier.\\nHarris enters the debate in the reverse position. Much is expected of the charismatic US senator, a skilled interlocutor who debated frequently during her own campaign for the Democratic nomination.\\nShe also faces the same double standard women contenders do about tone when they bring strong attacks. \\nThe low-key Pence is an underrated debater. Four years ago, he was widely seen as winning the vice presidential debate with Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, during which Pence deftly parried Kaine\\'s attacks on Trump and launched his own against Hillary Clinton.\\nBut this vice presidential debate will be different than any that have proceeded it.\\nAmericans will not just be weighing arguments. Now, more than ever, they will be closely evaluating these contenders as potential occupants of the Oval Office. \\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)Census Bureau officials warned in mid-July that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\\' orders to end the 2020 census early risked producing a tally of \"unacceptable quality\" with \"fatal flaws\" that carries the stain of \"politically-manipulated results.\" \\nThe revelations are in an expansive set of internal Census Bureau and Commerce Department records produced Saturday by the Trump administration, which is defending in the courts its plan to end 2020 census counting on September 30, rather than October 31. A CNN review of nearly 15,000 pages of documents revealed previously unreported details from emails, memoranda, instant messages, presentations and briefings that show how the decision developed behind the scenes.  \\nThe officials -- top-ranking, career statistical professionals at the Census Bureau -- prepared to send their director before Congress on July 29 with a plea for more time. Even technological improvements, they wrote in his notes, \"will not enable us to meet the statutory deadlines based on projected current field completion dates.\"  \\nRELATED: Shortening 2020 census risks \\'serious errors,\\' officials warned\\nDirector Steve Dillingham didn\\'t deliver that message. Instead, he told lawmakers he was \"aware that discussions have been held between the administration and Congress\" but that he was \"not involved directly.\"  \\nBy that point, Ross, who oversees the Census Bureau, had directed officials to show him within days how they would condense the counting effort.  \\nCensus experts reasoned the last possible day to have government employees knocking on doors around the country was September 30. That would give statistical workers just three months to crunch the numbers, remove duplicate responses, search other databases to count households that had not responded, scour for anomalies and present numbers to President Donald Trump by December 31.  \\nThe extension until April that Census Bureau officials wanted -- and the Trump administration had earlier supported -- might mean a new occupant of the Oval Office, who could overturn the controversial Trump directive to exclude undocumented immigrants from the final figures. That directive has since been blocked by a panel of federal judges and the Trump administration is appealing to the Supreme Court.\\nThe final apportionment figures are used to divide up the seats in Congress, determine presidential electoral votes and determine in which states and communities billions of federal dollars are spent.  \\nThe coronavirus pandemic made their work tougher, a team of senior officials wrote in a memo. They believed submissions would \"require additional data processing to ensure people are accurately counted in the correct location.\" Condensing the operations would \"run the risk\" of errors and \"additional legal challenges\" to the figures \"as a result of diminished quality.\"  \\nIn early July, Census officials were briefing members of Congress about the challenges they faced, including a committee that determines how much funding federal agencies receive.  \\nBy July 21, Census officials wrote they had \"developed a plan in response to Secretarial direction\" to meet the December 31 deadline. It included ending counting in September, then \"compressing and streamlining backend processing.\"  \\nBut they appeared uncertain which deadline Ross, the commerce secretary, would choose.  \\nOn July 23, Kathleen Styles, a Census Bureau official who oversees relationships with outside groups, wrote to her colleagues that \"the situation will change in the coming days,\" but that it was worth spreading the message about the risks to an abbreviated count.  \\nThe memo she and colleagues wrote left no question about their position.\\n\"High Level Message,\" it read. \"Curtailing census operations will result in a census that is of unacceptable quality.\"  \\nThe \"full 120 days\" extension \"that the Administration originally requested\" would be \"the best change to produce high quality, useable census results in this difficult time,\" the memo added.  \\nThe bureau, it noted, had pulled Census employees out of the field because of the pandemic, and changed procedures \"intended to produce the most accurate census possible, and cannot be rushed without diminishing data quality or introducing unacceptable risk to either operations or field staff.\"  \\nThe early end to operations meant enumerators, who knock on the doors of households that have not yet responded, would have to go out even when the coronavirus was not under control in their area.  \\nEnrique Lamas, a senior adviser in Dillingham\\'s office, asked officials to consider whether they would indeed \"send staff out to all locations (regardless of covid levels)\" in the next several days.  \\n\"I think that is a big decision and we need to (be) clear,\" he wrote.    \\nAbout a week after the alarming memo from Styles and her colleagues, Ross instructed Census Bureau officials to present to him in just four days a way to conclude counting on September 30.  \\nCensus officials held calls and exchanged plans until nearly midnight that Saturday and Sunday to present him with a plan at 8 a.m. on August 3. The announcement of the September deadline came later that day.  \\nAs Census field operations leader Jamey Christy wrote in an email, the \"acceleration\" was underway.  \\n\\n'},\n",

Coronavirus\\xa0\\nAfter China spent the last few months getting the coronavirus under control, hundreds of millions of people there are expected to be on the move in the next few days as the country celebrates the National Day holiday. The eight-day Mid-Autumn Festival break is China\\'s first major holiday since its peak of the Covid-19 crisis, and it will be a tense test of just how secure the country\\'s pandemic response is. Meanwhile, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has extended the no-sail order for cruise ships through October 31. The CDC said recent outbreaks on cruise ships prove the vessels could be used to \"transmit and amplify\" the spread of the disease. More than 1 million people have died of the coronavirus worldwide, and the US death toll now stands at more than 206,900.\\n2. Election 2020\\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates says it will make changes to the format of the remaining presidential debates to \"ensure a more orderly discussion\" after Tuesday night\\'s event devolved into chaos. At least 73 million viewers tuned in to the debate, but the acrimonious clash sent ripples of uncertainty through Wall Street. As the election road winds on, the focus is still on voting accessibility and security. A federal judge dismissed a Trump campaign effort to prevent Montana from letting counties issue mail ballots, pointing to the fact that widespread voter fraud is a \"fiction.\" Facebook also announced it will not accept ads that spread doubt about voting methods\\xa0or seek to delegitimize the election results.\\n3. Economy\\xa0\\nAmerican and United airlines are cutting 32,000 jobs as a federal prohibition on layoffs in the industry expires with no stimulus safety net in sight. American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said the cuts were unavoidable after attempts to get more federal aid failed. Things may have been different if Congress showed any movement in approving that $2.2 trillion stimulus package (which would have included $25 billion for the airline industry), but House Democrats have decided to hold off on a vote to garner more bipartisan support. Job cuts are also hitting Goldman Sachs. The bank paused layoffs during the pandemic to avoid sowing employee uncertainty. HBSC started slashing jobs due to the coronavirus crisis back in June, and Wells Fargo says layoffs will affect its ranks soon, too.\\n4. Immigration\\xa0\\nTwenty-one people died in ICE custody in the fiscal year that ended yesterday. That\\'s more than double the number of deaths in fiscal year 2019 and the highest annual death toll in 15 years. Immigrants rights advocates say the deaths are a sign of deteriorating conditions, serious problems with medical care and ICE\\'s flawed approach to handling the pandemic. More than a third of those who died in ICE custody last year had tested positive for Covid-19. While ICE officials maintain that deaths in custody are extremely rare, the agency has faced growing scrutiny for how it handles even routine medical care. Two weeks ago, a former employee at an ICE facility in Georgia filed a complaint detailing high rates of hysterectomies and alleged medical neglect.\\n5. Malaysia\\nUS Customs and Border Protection is blocking palm oil and palm oil products from Malaysia over allegations of forced labor abuses, including physical and sexual violence, debt bondage, withholding of wages and use of child labor. The restrictions are part of a larger mission by the agency to target overseas forced labor practices. These kinds of crackdowns started increasing after a 2016 change in US law renewed CBP\\'s mandate to block products made with forced labor. In the fiscal year 2020, the agency issued 13 such restrictions -- more than any other fiscal year.\\xa0\\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\\nWalmart is redesigning its stores to make things easier to find\\xa0\\nNow maybe you won\\'t emerge in a daze with bags full of stuff and no recollection of what you originally came in for.\\xa0\\n\\'The Bachelorette\\' host Chris Harrison promises the \\'most explosive\\' season fans have ever seen\\nIs \"explosive\" something we want in a dating show?

       "  'body': ' (CNN)An empty chair before a panel of lawmakers this week became the latest affront to a Democratic-led House by the Trump administration. \\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf skipped a House hearing on threats to the US homeland Thursday despite a subpoena compelling him to attend. But as Democratic members of the Homeland Security Committee lamented his absence, Wolf had other plans: meet with Senate committee staff to discuss his nomination to get the job leading the department on a permanent basis.\\nDemocratic Chairman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi called the empty chair \"an appropriate metaphor for the Trump administration\\'s dereliction on so many of these critical homeland security issues.\"\\nWolf\\'s rise to his current position as one of President Donald Trump\\'s most prominent Cabinet members has been anything but conventional and yet, seemingly inevitable in a department rattled with consistent leadership turnover. \\nThe carousel of leaders who have filled, then vacated, roles within the Department of Homeland Security over the last three years has fueled turmoil and distrust. It also resulted in Wolf\\'s ascent. \\nThe third largest federal department, which is at the core of the President\\'s policy agenda, has had five secretaries since Trump took office, only two of whom were Senate-confirmed: John Kelly and Kirstjen Nielsen. In recent months, federal judges and a government watchdog have cast doubt on the validity of the appointments of the top two officials in DHS leadership, Wolf and Ken Cuccinelli.  \\nPrevious secretaries tried to accommodate and then faced the wrath of a President who viewed the department as a political tool to help his reelection. From his earliest days in the Trump DHS, Wolf has cultivated an attentive relationship with Stephen Miller, Trump\\'s lead immigration adviser and architect of the administration\\'s hardline immigration policies, a source close to Wolf said.\\n\"Chad has always been highly responsive to Stephen Miller,\" the source said, citing it as a factor into Wolf\\'s rise. \\nIn Trump\\'s renewed law-and-order push, Wolf has become crucial to the President\\'s reelection strategy -- fielding criticism from current and former administration officials who argue he is further politicizing the department. \\n\"He\\'s made things more politicized and doesn\\'t inspire his workforce,\" one DHS official said. \\nInfighting within the department spilled into public view this month when Brian Murphy, who headed the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, filed a whistleblower complaint alleging Wolf and Cuccinelli repeatedly instructed career officials to modify intelligence assessments to suit Trump\\'s agenda by downplaying Russia\\'s efforts to interfere in the US and the threat posed by White supremacists. DHS has denied those claims. \\nA department spokesperson told CNN the view that Wolf is further politicizing the department \"is a talking point by one party. The vast majority of Americans would say that acting Secretary Wolf is just doing his job.\"\\nTrump himself has repeatedly lavished praise on Wolf -- at times, cutting into his news conferences to single Wolf out and commend his work. \"Where is Chad? Thank you very much, Chad. You\\'re right in the heart of it, and you\\'ve got some big things coming,\" Trump said at an August event. \"Good job.\" \\nLatest in a line of \\'acting\\' leaders\\nThe job of acting secretary is not a position Wolf expected to find himself in. The request to take the acting secretary role was abrupt and came amid the departure of his predecessor Kevin McAleenan, who stayed on longer than planned while the White House scrambled for a replacement. The administration tried to elevate Cuccinelli and Mark Morgan, both who were leading agencies within DHS at the time, but neither were eligible. When Wolf took over the top role in mid-November it was unclear how long he would last. \\n\"He did not seek the position but was asked to fill it. He took the role due to his strong desire to serve his country,\" a DHS spokesperson said. \\nFormer Homeland Secretary Michael Chertoff, who served under President George W. Bush, recently said the President \"has done everything he can to cripple the leadership at the department by not allowing anybody to occupy the position permanently.\"\\n\"If Trump gets reelected, it kind of exceeds my imagination,\" said Chertoff during a panel discussion earlier this month about the future of DHS. \"The more there is a sense that you have a President who wants to politicize the department like this, the harder it\\'s going to be to retain people and the harder it is to retain public trust, which for DHS is critical if it\\'s going to carry out its mission,\" Chertoff added. \\nThe acting DHS chief addressed criticism in the department\\'s annual State of the Homeland address. \\n\"Amidst this shifting series of challenges, a vocal and ill-informed minority has clamored to paint recent DHS actions as examples of mission drift or politicization. They could not be more wrong,\" Wolf said during his nearly 40-minute speech. \\nDHS was born in a political morass closely identified with the Bush-era controversial counter-terrorism measures. The department spent the intervening years trying to depoliticize and show itself to be a law enforcement agency on par with FBI and others. But since Trump took office, it\\'s been thrown back into the political maelstrom.\\nThis month\\'s whistleblower complaint marked another rupture in a department operating with a litany of temporary leadership. \\nSince Trump took office, DHS has mostly been defined by its immigration mission, including a fervent push to build the border wall and the arrest and deportation of undocumented immigrants. By the time Wolf came into the acting secretary post, the surge of migrants at the US-Mexico border that had embroiled the department -- and angered the President -- for months in 2019 had started to wind down, allowing Wolf to stay largely under the radar after assuming the role. \\nAligned with Trump\\'s agenda \\nIn February, Wolf went on Fox News and picked a fight with New York, which is led by a Democratic governor, over a state law that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for a New York driver\\'s licenses while protecting applicants\\' information from immigration enforcement agencies. The move was in lockstep with Trump who, in his State of the Union address earlier that week, blamed New York\\'s \"sanctuary\" policies for causing harm to the public. \\nThe motivations behind the decision were called into question and DHS eventually admitted in court documents that it made false statements to defend the move. New York residents have since been allowed to participate in Trusted Traveler Programs, which allow for speedy access though airports and land borders.\\nBut in Wolf, Trump seemed to have an ally. \\n\"I think they\\'re more comfortable that Wolf understands his role,\" one source told CNN, referring to the White House. \"Things aren\\'t going to go well if he\\'s going to see himself as a resistor to the President\\'s policy agenda.\" \\nWhite House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews said in a statement that \"acting Secretary Wolf is a tremendous asset to the department and the President\\'s mission which is why the President recently nominated him to permanently serve in the role. He has been instrumental in implementing policies responsible for safeguarding the American people and our homeland.\"\\nWolf\\'s ascent to acting secretary \\nWolf\\'s time at the Department of Homeland Security predates Trump. Shortly after the 9/11 attacks, Wolf served as assistant administrator of transportation security policy, helping to establish the Transportation Security Administration within the department.\\nWolf, who grew up in Mississippi and Texas, worked for a lobbying firm for more than 10 years until returning to TSA in 2017. \\nUnder the Trump administration, Wolf has filled a number of roles at the department, where he worked closely with former Secretary Nielsen, whose tenure was marked by the administration\\'s controversial \"zero tolerance\" policy that led to the separation of thousands of families who illegally crossed the border. Shortly before Nielsen was ousted, Wolf was transferred to the policy office, setting up his rise at the department. \\nFastidious about his clothing and appearance, Wolf managed to melt in with any number of aides in background photos with senior officials over the first three years of the administration.  \\nCurrent and former officials say Wolf\\'s proximity to previous secretaries have shaped his tenure as acting chief. He\\'s also been described as pensive, but hard to read on where he stands on policy issues. \"He\\'s an on-time type of personality,\" said one former DHS official.\\nIn recent months, Wolf\\'s staff have created an \"almost fandom\" around him, said the former official, such as posting pictures of him in a helicopter with \"5 o\\'clock shadow\" on Instagram. \"Trump likes you to be an entertainer, he likes when people are on TV and that catches his eye,\" the former official added. \\n\"Acting Secretary Wolf strongly believes that the role of the secretary includes explaining to the public the important work DHS is doing,\" the DHS spokesperson said. \\nOutside of the department, Wolf plays tennis and likes to cycle. His Secret Service detail recently had to start using electric bicycles to keep up with him on rides. \\nBefore assuming the top DHS post, Wolf, 44, was nominated by Trump to serve as undersecretary for the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans at DHS and confirmed by the Senate for the policy role on November 13, 2019 -- the same day, he was designated as the acting secretary. \\nCovid and protests\\nIn his nearly year-long tenure as acting chief, Wolf has been involved in the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic (the Federal Emergency Management Agency which has been a lead coordinator falls under DHS); established a new task force aimed at protecting federal monuments at the President\\'s request; and visited Portland, Oregon, the site of protests following the police killing of George Floyd, and admonished the city for the persistent unrest there. The department also continues to roll out strict immigration measures and build Trump\\'s signature border wall. \\nIn mid-July, Wolf visited Portlan after weeks of ongoing protests, some of which were violent and targeted federal buildings and personnel. Wolf said that \"lawless anarchists\" were set on destroying property and attacking federal law enforcement officers. He also accused local leaders of a failed response that emboldened the \"violent mob.\"\\nDHS law enforcement officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection were deployed to Portland to assist the Federal Protective Service, which is responsible for protecting federal government facilities and their employees and visitors.\\nThere were concerns among rank-and-file leadership about the lack of training and equipment for DHS personnel deployed to Portland, a DHS official told CNN. \"The response to the civil unrest has been challenging,\" the official said, adding that it was unusual for federal special agents to be tasked with riot control. A former senior DHS official told CNN that DHS did not put law enforcement personnel in \"a position that they were not ready to perform.\"\\nHomeland Security personnel often support local law enforcement when requested and work in close coordination with them. But in Portland, local leaders argued the unwanted increase in federal presence only escalated tensions.\\nThe administration eventually reached a deal with Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, and federal authorities began to step back. Wolf later admitted that the department needs to do a better job communicating.\\n\"I don\\'t know that he fully appreciated going into Portland, how outside of the norm that was,\" said the former DHS official. \"He does not have a good framework for how that part of Homeland Security functions, the nature of, the politics of dealing with states and dealing with localities.\"\\nIn late August, weeks into the Portland unrest, Trump announced his intention to nominate Wolf to serve as Homeland Security secretary -- a surprising maneuver given Trump\\'s preference to have Cabinet officials serve as acting because, he says, it gives him \"more flexibility.\" DHS has not had a Senate-confirmed secretary since April 2019. \\n\"I strongly believe that the department needs a confirmed secretary,\" Wolf told CNN two days before the President announced the nomination in a tweet.\\nCNN\\'s Evan Perez contributed to this report. \\n'},\n",

View more opinion articles on CNN.\\n (CNN)President Donald Trump\\'s toxic performance in the first presidential debate against Democratic challenger and former Vice President Joe Biden highlights anti-Black racism\\'s stranglehold on American democracy. \\nTuesday night\\'s spectacle, was easily the worst presidential debate since live television contests were first aired in 1960, with a debate between then-Vice President Richard Nixon and young Massachusetts Sen. John Fitzgerald Kennedy. \\nTrump consistently steamrolled moderator Chris Wallace, a seasoned reporter many thought would have fared better. Trump\\'s falsehoods and outright whoppers about his administration\\'s inept handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, his xenophobic pillorying of China and prevarications about his personal income taxes set the stage for direct appeals to America\\'s worst racial impulses. \\nTrump\\'s championing of \"law and order\" eliminated the dog whistles of which he and his administration have long been fond with more naked appeals to White voters\\' racial fears. He has accused Biden of wanting to \"destroy\" the suburbs -- which in his apocalyptic imagination are lily white -- by not standing up to antifa and left-wing forces. Asked to publicly disavow white supremacist and military groups, Trump dodged the question. When pressed on a specific far-right group, he said he would tell them to \"stand back and stand by.\" These comments implied they should be ready to pounce and wreak havoc if -- as Trump has repeatedly warned is possible (warnings he stunningly chose to reiterate from the debate stage) -- the election results don\\'t favor him.\\nOn Wednesday, Tim Scott, the lone Black Republican senator, called on President Trump to clarify his failure to condemn such groups and in doing so Inadvertently amplified their notoriety. \"I think he should correct it, if he doesn\\'t correct it, I guess he didn\\'t misspeak.\" Scott also said he\\'d sent his comments to the White House chief of staff and said the response he got was \"thank you.\" Whether Trump walks this back or not, the American people understand his message loud and clear.    \\nRacial division lies at the beating heart of Trump\\'s meteoric political rise and his efforts to hold onto power at the cost of our democracy. The President\\'s public bragging about being supported by every major police union in America, perhaps because of and not despite his racist appeals, offers the biggest moral and political justification for reimagining public safety.\\nNow is the time for choosing sides. \\nWith every utterance that comes out of his mouth Trump makes the case against his re-election clear. Not only is he unfit for the nation\\'s highest office, he is plainly unworthy to represent the hopes, dreams, and aspirations that are tied to this republic. \\nBiden appeared steady for the most part, but still left plenty of opportunities to make a public case against Trump\\'s racism behind. The case against Trump as an existential threat to American democracy has always been less rooted in allegations of financial malfeasance, ethical lapses and treasonous collusion with foreign powers (although he is indeed accused of and has denied all these things). Trump\\'s most malevolent, and so far successful, gambit has been his blunt exploitation of the nation\\'s original sin. \\nHe\\'s had lots of practice.\\nFrom charges that his father\\'s real estate empire discriminated against Black tenants to Trump\\'s well-documented call to bring back the death penalty in the Central Park Five jogger case and his failure to apologize after the defendants (Black and Puerto Rican teenagers) were exonerated, the President has pitted White Americans against people of color, specifically Black folk.\\nTrump\\'s initially longshot presidential campaign in 2016 tapped into a thick undercurrent of White supremacist adulation in a way that echoed past segregationist campaigns run by South Carolina Dixiecrat Strom Thurmond in 1948 and Alabama\\'s George Wallace in 1968, as well as the xenophobic America first campaigns of Pat Buchanan in 1992, 1996 and 2000 (and once he became the nominee and now as an incumbent, Trump has arguably surpassed them all in terms of the power and reach of his racism).  \\nTrump\\'s open verbal assault as a candidate on some of the Mexican immigrants who come to America as \"rapists,\" and his decrying Haiti and nations in the developing world as \"shithole countries,\"  and publicly expressing admiration for Confederate generals such as Robert E. Lee while President of the United States have proven to be the tip of a noxious iceberg. \\nTrump\\'s clash with Biden on Tuesday also resurrected the ghosts of the Democratic Party\\'s racial past when he, correctly if without important historical context, charged the former vice president with authoring the 1994 crime bill that greatly accelerated the system of mass incarceration at the expense of Black dignity and citizenship. \"You called them superpredators Joe,\" Trump said, reminding Biden and the nation of an ugly era of bipartisan agreement during the Reagan-Bush-Clinton years that located the origins of the nation\\'s urban crisis in young Black bodies rather than systemic racism, unemployment, poverty, failing schools and segregation. (Though Biden did use the term \"predators,\" the word \"superpredator\" was actually used by then-first lady Hillary Clinton to advocate for the bill -- a description of gangs and drug cartels that she later said she regretted). \\nThis election represents a hinge moment in American history, a watershed opportunity for a reset that may allow us to begin the hard work of forging a new national democratic consensus out of the ashes of an era of plague, pandemic, and protest. Racial slavery remains America\\'s original sin, a system that helped birth the world\\'s greatest and richest democracy at the expense of the collective national soul. \\nDonald Trump\\'s grotesque use of that painful history represents a contemporary reckoning for a debt that remains unpaid and long overdue. In rejecting his appeals to division, chaos, and racial mistrust we have the opportunity to reset the course of American history by creating a democracy expansive and big hearted enough to recognize itself in the beautiful diversity of its multiracial and multicultural citizens.  \\n\\n'},\n",

No one should forget that it was McConnell who blocked a Senate confirmation process for former President Barack Obama\\'s Supreme Court pick, Merrick Garland, following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February of 2016 because, McConnell argued, the seat should not be filled before a national election nearly nine months away. \\nThe disrespect and blatant hypocrisy displayed by Trump and McConnell perfectly encapsulates the political perversion we\\'ve seen over nearly four years. From Trump\\'s depraved attacks against undocumented immigrants to his nasty and divisive rhetoric to his seemingly never ending list of scandals and his gross mishandling of Covid-19, Trump\\'s toxic combination of political inexperience, mendacity and cunning have brought heartache, anxiety and loss to far too many Americans. That he has been protected by Republicans who have engaged in a pattern of asymmetrical political warfare designed to ensure their partisan advantage at the expense of our constitution and democratic institutions is devastating.    \\nMy late husband, Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, who passed away in October of 2019, was not only concerned about the Republican Party\\'s irreverence, he was deeply disturbed by Trump\\'s erratic and autocratic style of leadership. So much so that, by the end of his life, he had determined that Trump was not simply unfit for the position of president, but that he was also an imminent danger to the American people and our system of government. Elijah, quite simply, viewed the 2020 election as the battle for the future of our democracy.  \\nThe son of two preachers, Elijah was raised to believe in fair play, which meant that you played by the rules, treated people the way you wanted to be treated and didn\\'t judge a book by its cover. \\nSo, when Trump became President of the United States after a contentious campaign, and after Elijah\\'s friend and mentor -- the late Georgia. Rep. John Lewis -- called on Democrats to boycott the inauguration, he sought Lewis\\'s blessing to attend. Why? Because, despite all that had occurred, he wanted to make a good faith effort to work with the new president while respecting the institutions of our republic.  \\nIf there was an opportunity to work with Trump to get things accomplished for the American people, he was determined to find it. So, Elijah and I went to the inauguration and the post-inaugural luncheon where he introduced himself to the President and pitched the idea of working together to lower prescription drug prices to help the American people. \\nBut after a meeting in early 2017, which Elijah initially thought went pretty well, Trump promptly lied to the media about what Elijah said and showed no appetite to collaborate on prescription drug pricing. \\nThat is, until July of 2020, when -- in a seemingly desperate campaign move -- he signed a series of executive orders claiming sole credit for trying to lower prescription drug costs, deliberately thumbing his nose at the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Prescription Drug Costs Now bill (named in Elijah\\'s honor) which was passed in the House at the end of 2019. \\nElijah wouldn\\'t have been surprised at Trump\\'s slight because he\\'d watched Trump denigrate former President Barack Obama and attempt to undo or claim credit for Obama administration accomplishments. \\nGrowing up in the Jim Crow South, Elijah understood how the psychology and ethos of racism prevented people from acknowledging the ideas, accomplishments and dignity of people of color because they fundamentally conflicted with their own belief system. Trump\\'s comfort using racist and dehumanizing language and adopting racist policies simply reinforced Elijah\\'s perceptions about Trump\\'s inherent biases and his inability to lead a diverse nation. Trump\\'s repeated attacks on Baltimore, a diverse US city that Trump has consistently attempted to define as undeserving and outside of the body politic, was yet another proof point.  \\nAlthough Elijah considered the attacks against him and Baltimore painful, one of his biggest concerns was with what he called the President\\'s \"empathy deficit,\" or inability to understand and feel the pain of others. The investigations Elijah led on the child separations of migrant families at the US southern border led him to believe that Trump had a streak of cruelty that revealed an extreme indifference to the value of human life.   \\nElijah wrote his book, \"We\\'re Better Than This: My Fight for the Future of our Democracy,\" before the world ever knew the novel coronavirus was coming, but if he were alive to see what has transpired, he would have deduced that Trump\\'s response was not simply inept but came at the cost of innocent American lives. \\nTrump\\'s private acknowledgement to Bob Woodward that he knew the disease was deadly from the very beginning (\"it goes through the air,\" he told Woodward in February) would have made it clear that his failure to develop a national plan, his efforts to misinform and disinform and his administration\\'s lawsuit to invalidate the Affordable Care Act in the midst of a global pandemic endangered all Americans -- but especially African Americans, Latinos and Native Americans, who have alarming and disproportionately high rates of Covid-19 infections and deaths. \\nElijah also determined that Trump does not understand or seem to care about civics, so he tramples over rules, norms and restrictions in a way that places the institutions of our democracy under extreme threat. In Elijah\\'s lifetime, Trump\\'s flagrant disregard for democratic norms took the form of telling brazen and constant falsehoods, refusing to testify or turn over documents, ignoring subpoenas, and leveraging the courts to stonewall and avoid accountability. Since Elijah\\'s death, the Justice Department, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the US Postal Service are just a few public institutions that Trump has flagrantly used against the American people for his own personal and political benefit.\\nAs Elijah predicted, our nation\\'s democratic institutions are under assault and facing a growing crisis of legitimacy. Written in the last year of Elijah\\'s life, his book \"We\\'re Better Than This\" -- released today -- was his urgent call for the American people to do everything in their power to prevent Trump from being reelected. For Elijah believed with every fiber of his being that Trump\\'s reelection would result in the death of American democracy and every promise of security, freedom and justice it affords. \\n\\n'},\n",

Most recently, he is the author of \"Mass Appeal: Communicating Policy Ideas in Multiple Media.\" Follow him on Twitter @_JustinGest. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\\n (CNN)At a moment when Americans are anxious about their health, their economic futures and the impartiality of law enforcement, President Donald Trump is instilling widespread doubt about the integrity of our electoral institutions.\\n \\nTrump has repeatedly declined to pledge a peaceful transfer of power and sought to, without proof, invalidate mail-in ballot systems -- which disproportionate numbers of Democrats say they plan to request to avoid health risks associated with the pandemic. In Tuesday night\\'s debate, Trump went so far as to refer to the election as \"a disaster ... a fraud like you\\'ve never seen.\" But before the President\\'s recent rhetoric, Republicans were actually more confident in the integrity of US elections than Democrats were, according to an Ipsos/C-SPAN poll.\\n \\nThe Transition Integrity Project, a bipartisan group of over 100 former government officials, campaign leaders and journalists, has publicly warned that the Trump campaign may attempt to \"halt the counting of mail-in ballots by filing cases in state court or leaning on Republican leaders to stop vote counting or to certify a result early, without waiting for the certified results from the Secretary of State,\" or mobilize their \"committed base to take to the streets in Trump\\'s favor.\" This would be consistent with a White House that has already tried to curtail census counting for undocumented immigrants and alleged voter fraud without evidence.\\n \\nBoth the Trump and Joe Biden campaigns have retained teams of lawyers to litigate the outcome of the election in case the outcome is appealed in courts, and each party\\'s supporters fear the other will use tactics to cheat or suppress voting. Numerous law enforcement professionals are preparing for street violence and civil unrest, while there are calls for international election observers -- who normally evaluate the fairness and freedom of elections in fragile democracies and autocracies in developing countries -- to scrutinize the US polls. Meanwhile, non-profit groups are forming groups devoted to ensuring that election officials count every vote.\\n \\nBut doubt\\'s counteragent is not violence or litigation -- it\\'s faith.\\n \\nHow can we re-instill faith in America\\'s electoral institutions before November 3?\\n \\nFirst, members of the press and civil society groups should demand that both parties\\' candidates and officeholders standing for election this fall evaluate election procedures in their respective jurisdictions in advance of Election Day and publicly declare confidence in or concern about their integrity. To be credible, this should be a true examination of plans and procedures.\\n \\nSitting incumbents, most of whom are statistically likely to win, should be inclined to do this because they won\\'t want their victories questioned or undermined and because election procedures have proven to be generally sound. This would mean that any post hoc contestations would contradict earlier certifications. These statements will also help reassure skeptics among both sides\\' supporters.\\n \\nThey would likely find the same thing Trump\\'s own commission on election integrity found before it was disbanded in January 2018: no evidence to support claims of widespread voter fraud. They would also find a US Postal Service capable of ensuring ballot security and delivering hundreds of millions of ballots.\\n \\nSecond, state governments should announce an estimate of when they expect to provide final counts of their mail-in voting to manage expectations for when the final total results will be announced. Michigan\\'s Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, for instance, recently made news when she announced that the swing state\\'s results are unlikely to be complete until up to a week after the election. \\n \\nIf more states do this, it would help news outlets further recalibrate their approach to election night coverage. It would reduce their reliance on exit polling and postpone much of the anticipation in the media and among the electorate about the release of results until the appropriate moment. \\nAmericans are accustomed to knowing results within hours of precinct closures; these expectations must be adjusted well in advance of Election Day by those who set them. For the sake of peace, it would even be advisable for state governments to only release final results, instead of the usual, slow precinct-by-precinct trickle.\\n \\nThird, all state governments should aggregate and make public the number of mail-in ballots requested as a share of total ballots expected to be cast. This will communicate the magnitude of people who will be voting this year and provide an estimate of how many votes are likely to be outstanding when any preliminary results are released on election night.\\n \\nAccording to data analyzed by the MIT Election Data and Science Lab, past mail-in ballot trends suggest that mail-in ballots would have been about 30% of total ballots cast in 2020 if the pandemic wasn\\'t a factor. That is already reason to await a full count in swing states, and of course that share is now expected to rise. \\n \\nNone of these suggested actions should replace Election Day protections that ensure election integrity, voter security and legal advocacy. But taking such preemptive steps will help mitigate the intensity of the crisis that many expect. Metaphorically, they would make the American civic fabric more durable.\\n \\nIt is, after all, that civic fabric that is at stake. Too many Americans not only doubt the integrity of US institutions and politicians, they doubt the integrity of their fellow citizens. Our deep polarization has disconnected us from each other and for many, has made the other side appear as an existential threat. This makes people less willing to lose and more willing to overlook inconvenient truths when they win.\\n \\nTrump, who overtly values loyalty over integrity, plays directly to this skepticism by suggesting that nonpartisan institutions, peer-reviewed science and the press are just as corrupted as he is. \\n \\nThe doubt that Trump is sowing and exploiting is now spreading to American democracy itself. It is time we take affirmative steps to cultivate and renew our faith -- first in our electoral system, next in our fellow citizens.\\n\\n'},\n",

He is the author of several books, most recently \"The Sword and the Shield: The Revolutionary Lives of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.\" The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\\n (CNN)How did the President of the United States become one of the nation\\'s largest threats to public health and safety? When one man became head of \"church\" and state: the Church of Trump, that is.  \\nFor many of his most ardent supporters, Donald Trump has indeed become a church -- defined as a gathering place or grouping point for like-minded individuals to learn, express and amplify a set of beliefs that they collectively define and refine over time. While unable to articulate any meaningful religious experience, biblical knowledge or deep belief system, the President has become, for many, the embodiment of a peculiar definition of American exceptionalism. \\nThe President\\'s record of denigrating racial minorities, his ad hominem attacks on immigrants, and travel restrictions against people from seven predominantly Muslim countries become, in this perspective, admirable leadership qualities. Trump\\'s naked promotion of racial division during his 2020 campaign, through an advocacy of \"law and order\" politics that essentially defines suburbs as White, and \"Chicago\" and other Democratic-led cities as Black and dangerous, is consonant with the views of many religious and secular conservatives.    \\nThe sea of White faces ensconced in a Rose Garden ceremony honoring Judge Amy Coney Barrett\\'s Supreme Court nomination gives a strong clue to the kind of parishioners welcome at this church of Trump. What many view as Barrett\\'s faith-based legal approach (a characterization she rejects) makes her a model jurist for religious conservatives (also most welcome at the church of Trump), many of whom have continued to embrace the President despite his repeated ethical and moral lapses.\\nFor such allies, Trump\\'s personal integrity and capacity for empathy matter less than the right-wing policies he can impose on the nation and the number of conservative judges he can appoint to the federal bench to defend them.  \\nBut for many of the Americans who, before Trump was diagnosed, were denying or dismissing Covid-19 -- a disease that has utterly ravaged Black, Latinx and Native American communities in the US -- Trump has also come to represent a living church whose political insinuations of racial superiority attract unstinting loyalty from his most ardent supporters, no matter how nonsensical and dangerous he becomes; they seem comforted, not horrified, that he is capable of articulating and revising political, medical and personal doctrine on the fly. \\nJust witness the about-face, from downplaying the threat of the coronavirus to extolling Trump\\'s toughness and resilience, post-diagnosis, made by the White House and conservative media in recent days. Observe the disparate reactions to the medical emergency that forced him to go to Walter Reed Medical Center, and his behavior during his photo op when he endangered Secret Service and potentially others while fighting an active Covid-19 infection.\\nOf course, White supremacy and religion have a long history of enmeshment in America, with Martin Luther King Jr. famously remarking that the most segregated hour in the nation was during Sunday church service. But the church of Trump is different. Jimmy Carter was America\\'s first born-again Christian president, a man of sincere religious political conventions who pledged a foreign policy agenda guided by human rights. George W. Bush openly acknowledged his Christianity as the bedrock of his personal transformation from a young hell-raiser into a responsible adult.   Whatever their shortcomings and political failures, few ever questioned the sincerity of their religious faith.  \\nTrump has achieved something both more dangerous and unprecedented. The President has managed to become a one-person church worshiped by an overwhelmingly, although not exclusively, White congregation that seems to believe he can do no wrong. \\nFor the tens of millions of Americans who are mystified by the rapturous allegiance the President commands, news of his medical diagnosis confirmed their worst fears about the nation\\'s halting efforts to end this Covid-19 crisis. Hopes and prayers that Trump\\'s diagnosis might precipitate a miracle that imbued the President with a sense of empathy for the plight of the over 200,000 Americans who have perished from the coronavirus were quickly dashed by tone-deaf tweets, a hasty exit from the hospital against medical advice and a morally reprehensible photo op where Trump soullessly peeled off his mask on the White House balcony.\\nTrump supporters have, during this latest crisis, largely applauded their dear leader with even more reverence by abandoning logic and any pretense of intellectual and moral consistency.  The White House\\'s decision to limit contact tracing from the Rose Garden celebration makes no sense from a public health standpoint and seems intended to mitigate the political fallout from Judge Barrett\\'s disastrous debut.\\nSeveral friends and staffers close to the President have already been diagnosed with the coronavirus and Trump\\'s \"maskerade\" after leaving Walter Reed represents another display of the combined hubris and stupidity that have made him so endearing to the millions of Americans who seem to worship him.  \\nThe President\\'s pathological behavior, personal mendacity, flouting of the rules of Covid-19 precaution and overall endangering of democracy encourages the conspiracy-wielding, coronavirus-denying Americans among Trump\\'s base who embrace a distorted version of reality that has corrupted our politics and corroded our national identity.   \\nNotwithstanding the President\\'s bon mots to White supremacists and dangerous conspiracy theorists, the majority who eagerly worship at the altar of Trump have no intention of deploying the kind of violence he tacitly condones, even inspires, in some quarters.\\nThe Americans who attend mask-less rallies, brag about how intelligent and strong Trump is and rationalize the President\\'s inexcusable behavior during this year of plague and protest exhibit instead a kind of religious faith in an American fantasyland that has irrevocably altered the course of the nation\\'s history.  \\nAt the Rose Garden ceremony that turned into an unintended \"superspreading\" event, a President with no faith in anything or anyone but himself beamed at the prospect of appointing a Supreme Court justice whose rulings on abortion foreshadow constraint on the reproductive rights of women, both religious and secular, around the nation.  \\nThose in attendance came to symbolically kiss the ring of a President whose uncanny ability to detect political vulnerabilities allowed him to not just remake the GOP in his own image, but to erect a kind of parallel religious faith -- the Church of Trump -- where in a crowd of White faces, wearing masks that might save the lives of fellow human beings during a pandemic is never required.  \\n\\n'},\n",

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.\\n (CNN)There\\'s no point dancing around it: For a lot of Michigan liberals, the most important thing any presidential candidate can do is not be Donald Trump. \\nTrump 10,704-vote victory here helped him secure the presidency in 2016. It was a difficult pill to swallow for liberal voters in this state, reliably Democratic since 1992 -- an outcome driven as much by unexpected support for Trump as by low Democratic turnout, particularly in overwhelmingly blue Detroit. \\nStatewide, Trump is down nearly nine points against former Vice President Joe Biden, according to NBC/Marist latest poll. Notably, independent voters are aligning overwhelmingly with Democrats, per an earlier NBC/Marist poll of Michiganders \\nBiden needs suburban women and independents and Obama voters who flipped in 2016. \\nHe also needs Detroit. \\nDetroit is so heavily Democratic that the city\\'s legislative and congressional races are decided in party primaries. \\nAnd in 2016, 41,625 fewer Detroiters voted than in 2012. \\nDetroit\\'s population fell by an estimated 6% in the last decade, but that\\'s not the whole story. The March presidential primary offered a cautionary tale: As turnout soared across the state compared to 2016, it dropped about 2% (adjusted for population loss) in Detroit.\\nIn any other year, Biden might not be the man for the job. The 2020 presidential election began with the most diverse, progressive field of candidates in American history; some Michigan liberals were dismayed as Biden emerged as the frontrunner, a mainstream Democrat with a long history of political positions that don\\'t always look right in 2020. \\n \\nThis is a Democratic Party fractured in 2016 between the mainstream liberalism of nominee Hillary Clinton, and the progressive politics of US Sen. Bernie Sanders; against a growing social justice movement that believes the party isn\\'t doing enough to advance the goals of equity and reform it espouses; and a growing dissatisfaction among some Black voters that decades of reliable support for Democratic candidates haven\\'t resulted in equitable policy. \\nBut Biden won the March presidential primary with a decisive 52.9% of the vote, nearly 17 points ahead of Sanders, the next highest vote-getter -- the same night Michigan reported its first Covid-19 cases. \\nAnd this is not any other year. \\n\"This is a little like the last days of the World War I trenches in France. They can send poison tanks, mortar fire, and we can return fire, but we\\'re not going to take any territory and neither are they,\" said Mark Grebner, an Ingham County commissioner and founder of Lansing, Michigan-based Practical Political Consulting, which tracks voters and voting trends in Michigan in an interview last month. \"There is no middle ground.\"\\nBiden wasn\\'t Detroiter Khalilah Burt Gaston\\'s first choice. But he has her full support. \\n\"I\\'m a realist, and I think liberals can be too idealistic around identifying the perfect candidate, not understanding that people can shift on their own, but it\\'s also up to voters to cause people to shift, based on our continued advocacy,\" said Gaston, founder of equity consultancy Glidepath Strategies, in an interview earlier this month\\nFor Gaston, 44, the nominee and eventual president must address the nation\\'s twin pandemics: Covid-19 and police brutality. She wants a national, coordinated response to the ongoing pandemic, federal leadership and guidance around testing, and an independent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that\\'s equipped to handle a pandemic, free of any political influence. \\nShe wants to see the Justice in Policing Act passed and signed into law. She wants a compassionate immigration policy that offers a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in this country and also recognizes the need for a more functional immigration system, as well as the urgency around safety for refugees. And she wants federal investment in early childhood education and universal childcare.\\nFrom Biden, she hears enough of what she needs. But she\\'s also a pragmatist. \\n\"At the end of the day, those are campaign promises. For me, where my realism comes in, it\\'s not just what is a President Biden going to do in office,\" said Gaston. \"We have to have Democrats and liberals either in control of the US House and Senate, or we have to have concrete strategy to be able to flip people who are more moderate. That\\'s the sausage making.\"\\nFor Gaston, that\\'s manifest in Biden\\'s choice of running mate, US Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif. Harris, who is Black and South Asian, is the first mixed race woman at the top of a major party ticket. \\n\"I think the Democratic Party does take Black voters for granted, and especially Black women voters. I think the push to ensure the vice presidential candidate was a Black woman was one of those moments where the rubber is hitting the road ... celebrities, pundits came out and said, this needs to be a Black woman. If you\\'re serious about our votes, serious about our needs, you will pick a Black woman,\" she says. In Harris, the party delivered. \\nIt\\'s the same for Barbara Murray, 74, a former non-profit administrator liberal activist who split her time, before the pandemic, between Detroit and Cheboygan in northern Michigan. \\n\"He\\'s the traditional Democratic candidate, he\\'s kind of old-fashioned, and yet he does have listening skills. When he needs to change his tune, it seems to me he does,\" Murray said last week. \"A lot of it is who he\\'s got around him, too, and my God, he picked her! Good for him.\"\\nMurray wishes the environment were front and center in Biden\\'s campaign, but says even without that, there is still no contest. \\n\"I don\\'t think we have any choice,\" she said. \"It\\'s true that it\\'s anybody but Trump, in a way, but he\\'s a candidate that\\'s more than Not Trump. He is a smart man, he\\'s made his errors in his political career, but he knows where they are.\"\\nRecord-breaking turnout in the 2018 midterms -- also a gubernatorial election year in Michigan -- and in the March presidential primary suggest liberal voters are determined to avoid a repeat of 2016. But those numbers look different outside the context of a party primary. Will liberal voters\\' determination to defeat Trump stack up against conservatives bent on returning him to office? Will Democrats turned off by mainstream party politics turn out for Biden? \\nIn a way, the intense polarization of 2020 offers a reprieve for Democrats struggling to put their party back together: For some voters, Biden\\'s more than Not Trump. For others, he\\'s exactly that. But as long as beating Trump is job one, there\\'s still time to recalibrate.\\n\\n'},\n",

Indeed, her presence in popular culture rests in large part on the global popularity of hip hop, which represents a defining cultural innovation of post-civil rights America. \\nGinsburg and hip hop legend Christopher Wallace -- aka the original \"Notorious BIG\" -- shared a Brooklyn-born birthright forged in the crucible of a borough famous for producing icons (Jay-Z anyone?) who started out as underdogs. \\nShana Knizhik, an NYU law student, gave Justice Ginsburg the moniker \"Notorious RBG,\" popularized through a Tumblr account and a subsequent book co-authored with journalist Irin Carmon.

Ginsburg, in an unscripted moment with Katie Couric in 2016 she came to regret, characterized the protests as \"dumb and disrespectful.\" (She later said her comments had been \"inappropriately dismissive.\") \\nKaepernick, who surely knew of the Notorious RBG\\'s by now well-founded image as a political maverick and trailblazer, publicly admitted to finding her comments \"disappointing\" but stopped there.  \\nRecalling Ginsburg\\'s harsh initial comments about Kaepernick\\'s peaceful protest against racial injustice -- and reading them through the lens of her pop culture persona as Notorious RBG -- is not a call to cancel her posthumously. It is instead an opportunity for us to acknowledge the often unspoken boundaries of interracial political solidarity and to affirm the necessity for intergenerational and multiracial empathy within, among and between communities and leaders pursuing social justice.  \\nT-shirts and paraphernalia that transposed Justice Ginsburg\\'s sage face, framed by her trademark jabot, beneath a tilted crown like the one originally worn by Wallace in his \"King of New York\" photo shoot three days before his murder in 1997, helped -- alongside of a documentary, feature film, books and essays and op-eds -- turn Justice Ginsburg into a multigenerational and multiracial feminist icon. \\nJustice Ginsburg, through a rhetorical sleight of hand that she did not initiate, managed to gain access to all of the cool, hipness and lure of Blackness absent the exposure of racist terror, arrest, violence, and punishment.  \\nSince her death, pictures of a smiling Ginsburg embracing President Barack Obama during State of the Union speeches have, through symbolism, further underscored the fraught and sometimes disrupted connection between struggles for racial and gender justice that continue in our own time. \\nThese blinders were made all the more unfortunately ironic because of the nickname that will outlive her. That appellation \"Notorious RBG\" evoked the lyrical genius of Wallace, a former drug dealer turned rap artist -- whose ability to distill the joy and trauma of growing up poor and Black in Brooklyn during the Reagan era continues to galvanize generations of music lovers. \\nThe \"Notorious BIG\" represented to many White Americans during the 1990s, the specter of the \"superpredator\" -- the literal heart of darkness of America\\'s racial underclass they believed was destined to wreak havoc on suburbs if not immediately arrested, incarcerated, punished or prematurely killed. Wallace, affectionately known in the hip hop community as \"Biggie,\" rapped with an unflinching awareness of how his lyrical depiction of racism, crime, violence and the pursuit of success would be perceived by White audiences. \\nThat the scowling image of Wallace, adorned with a crown over his obsidian face, could be improbably transposed onto Justice Ginsburg in a manner that made her cool, fashionable, and popular without the danger associated with hip hop culture is, in some ways, unsurprising. In so doing the Notorious RBG became a millennial generation social justice icon, the object of intergenerational admiration that helped to give a human face to complex social justice issues decided at the nation\\'s highest court.  \\nBut there was also an act of appropriation in this naming. The Notorious RBG reached the hearts and minds of millions of young people on a scale that Associate Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg perhaps never could, despite her enviable educational pedigree and brilliant legal mind. The name gifted her with a mainstream version of the street swagger that helped make Christopher Wallace an icon whose premature death from a gangland style killing in 1997 helped to burn his image into legend.  \\nWhile the appellation wasn\\'t at all the only contributing factor to her iconic status -- which was further solidified time and again by fiery dissents in cases like Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. and Burwell v. Hobby Lobby -- in some ways, her persona as Notorious RBG and her stature on the bench mutually reinforced each other to propel her further into a cultural legend. For many Americans, especially younger ones, their admiration for the substance of Ginsburg\\'s ferocity and toughness as a jurist found a relatable outlet for expression through her status as Notorious RBG.\\nAt her empathetic best Justice Ginsburg recognized herself and the rough road she faced toward breaking barriers to become the first female tenured professor at Columbia University Law School and the second female justice on the Supreme Court in the stories, lives, and struggles of others. And her championing of justice for women did positively affect women of color. Yet race, as it often does in American history, represents perhaps the barrier that\\'s hardest to see and easiest to ignore. Justice Ginsburg\\'s ambivalent response to Kaepernick\\'s protest illustrates the ongoing need for greater racial empathy -- wide and deep enough to become political solidarity. \\nImagine a world wherein White women with power, future RBGs if you will, not only recognize the dignity and effervescent humanity in Martin Luther King Jr.\\'s march from Selma to Montgomery (as Ginsburg did in her powerful dissent in Shelby), but also see their own faces in the young Black women and men who have led demonstrations across the nation in search of the kind of justice that propelled a daughter of Jewish immigrants born in Brooklyn during the Great Depression into becoming a feminist icon.  \\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump and his Democratic opponent Joe Biden have spent the past few months attacking each other on several fronts. While Trump has leveled numerous baseless accusations against Biden, often exaggerating for effect, Biden has also made misleading and false claims about Trump, at times taking the President\\'s words out of context. \\nIn preparation for Tuesday\\'s debate, here\\'s a look at 10 attacks Biden and Trump have previously made about each other that are false, misleading or require some context. \\nTrump\\'s attacks\\nCoronavirus shutdowns\\nTrump has repeatedly said that Biden, if elected, plans to shut down the entire country to combat the coronavirus. \\nFacts First: This is wrong and needs context. Trump is referring to an interview where Biden was answering a question about a hypothetical scenario, not proposing a national shutdown. \\nDuring an ABC interview on August 21, Biden was asked what he would do if experts told him to shut down the country if he were president. Biden said, \"I would shut it down. I would listen to the scientists.\"\\nBiden was not suggesting the US should be shut down right now. Additionally, presidents can\\'t unilaterally shut down the country. They can offer guidance and take other measures, but their power to control what restrictions states put in place is limited.\\nYou can read the full exchange here.\\nPeaceful protestors\\nAt a campaign speech in North Carolina, Trump claimed Biden has cheered on rioters by referring to them as \"peaceful protesters.\"\\nFacts First: This is false. Biden has correctly noted that many protesters have been peaceful; he has not argued that the violent protesters are peaceful. Rather, he has repeatedly denounced violence, rioting and looting.\\nDefunding police\\nBoth Trump and his allies have accused Biden of wanting to defund the police or cut their funding. \\nFacts First: Biden has expressly not supported calls to \"defund the police.\" Part of his criminal justice plan includes a renewed investment in community policing initiatives. He has also suggested some funding could be redirected to social services, mental health counseling and affordable housing, but in July comments he made to an activist, Biden then immediately transitioned to his previous proposal to deny federal funding to specific police departments that do not meet certain standards.\\nYou can read more here.\\nHiding in the basement\\nOver the summer, Trump began insinuating that Biden was holed up in his basement and had only been campaigning from there since the start of the pandemic. \\nFacts First: This is an exaggeration. While Trump continued to travel for campaign purposes amidst the pandemic, Biden did campaign entirely from his home from mid-March through May, holding regular digital campaign events from his basement or living room. However, the former vice president has made multiple trips since late May. \\nAfter more than two months without public events due to the coronavirus pandemic and state stay-at-home orders, Biden emerged to lay a Memorial Day wreath on May 25. \\nBiden also attended a June 1 community meeting at Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Delaware, delivered a June 2 speech in Philadelphia about racism and leadership and a June 5 economic address in Delaware, met with the family of George Floyd on June 8 in Houston, and held a June 11 economic roundtable in Philadelphia. He has made numerous campaign stops in the intervening months.\\nBanning fracking\\nTrump has used Biden\\'s stance on fracking, a drilling method used to extract natural gas and oil, to attack him on two fronts. According to Trump, Biden repeatedly said he was going to ban fracking but has since flip-flopped on the issue.  \\nAt a recent campaign rally in Pennsylvania, Trump claimed Biden said, \"We\\'re going to ban fracking and he said that for a year. Then all of a sudden he said, well, maybe we\\'ll have some fracking.\"\\nA few days later, Trump said Biden\\'s \"taking everything back, he\\'s taken anti-fracking back.\" \\nFacts First: Trump\\'s characterization is misleading. Biden\\'s written plan never included a full ban on fracking. However, there is at least some basis for Trump\\'s claim: During the Democratic primary, Biden sometimes suggested he was proposing to get rid of all fracking, creating confusion over his stance. He has since explicitly said he does not support a nationwide fracking ban (though in part because he doesn\\'t believe such a ban would pass).\\nYou can read more about Biden\\'s past comments on fracking here. \\nBiden\\'s attacks\\nHoax ad\\nDuring his campaign\\'s highest week of ad spending, Biden tweeted out an ad attacking President Donald Trump for comments he has made over the pandemic. Specifically, the ad suggests that Trump has called the virus a hoax.\\nThe 25-second ad begins with a clip of Trump at a campaign rally on February 28 in South Carolina. The ad plays a quick clip of Trump saying \"the coronavirus\" then it cuts to him saying \"and this is their new hoax.\" Text on the ad reads, \"Trump in public: \\'Hoax.\\'\"\\nFacts First: This is a misleading attempt to suggest that Trump specifically called the coronavirus a hoax. While Trump\\'s comments were a bit confusing, Biden\\'s ad leaves out important context and dishonestly edits the two soundbites together.\\nTaken in totality, Trump\\'s comments at the February 28 rally indicate that he is deriding Democrats for attacking his performance on the coronavirus. A full 56 seconds pass between the two clips the campaign ad edited together.\\nYou can read more here. \\nUpside-down Bible \\nDuring a CNN town hall on September 17, Biden attacked Trump for posing for pictures while holding a Bible in front of a church after protesters were forcibly removed from a park across from the White House. Biden suggested that Trump held the Bible upside down, and then retreated back to a bunker.\\nBiden said the protesters were removed so Trump could \"walk across to a Protestant church and hold a Bible upside down -- I don\\'t know if he ever opened it -- upside down, and then go back to a bunker in the White House.\"\\nFacts First: Biden gets two facts wrong here. Trump did not hold a Bible upside down and his visit to the bunker was a few days before this event.\\nOn May 29, Trump was briefly taken to a White House bunker amid intense protests that evening. This was three days before the visit outside of St. John\\'s.\\nWhile posing in front of the church, Trump held a Bible out for the cameras. Photos and videos show that Trump held the Bible right side up.\\nTrade deficit\\nIn a campaign speech in Michigan, focused on manufacturing and his support for unions, Biden claimed that the US trade deficit has hit a record high under the current administration.\\n\"Under President Trump, US trade deficit has grown,\" Biden said. \"It\\'s hit an all-time high. Let me say that again. US trade deficit is at an all-time high, under Trump in the last three years.\"\\nFacts First: Biden is wrong. While the trade deficit has grown under Trump, measuring for both goods and services, the overall trade deficit has not hit an all-time high under Trump. Measured by just goods however, Biden is correct. However, he did not specify that he was talking only about goods.\\nThe total trade deficit hit a record $763.5 billion in 2006 under George W. Bush. By the end of Barack Obama\\'s term it had fluctuated and fallen to $481.2 billion in 2016, according to the Census Bureau.\\nThe deficit rose under Trump, hitting $576.9 billion in 2019, despite Trump\\'s promises during the 2016 campaign that he\\'d reduce it.\\nYou can read a longer fact check here. \\nWhite supremacy\\nIn a June 16 interview on Instagram with actress and musician Keke Palmer, Biden claimed that Trump has not acknowledged the problem of White supremacy.\\nFacts First: Trump has condemned White supremacy but only recently said \"there probably is some\" systemic racism in the US. \\nFollowing the mass shootings in Ohio and Texas in August 2019, Trump in prepared remarks said that \"in one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and White supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America.\"\\nTwo days after the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, during which Heather Heyer was killed, Trump issued a statement condemning racism, specifically \"the KKK, neo-Nazis, White supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\"\\nThis statement came a few days after Trump suggested there were \"very fine people on both sides\" of the rally and protest, a statement for which he has been sharply criticized by Biden and others.\\nTrump has also been criticized for not being as forceful or persistent in criticizing White supremacist violence as he has about terrorism by Islamic extremists or crime by undocumented immigrants -- and he has himself used racist rhetoric.\\nRegardless, it\\'s not true that he has not acknowledged the problem of White supremacy at all.\\nSocial Security confusion\\nBiden has often attacked Trump for his \"plan\" to eliminate a tax that funds most of Social Security. \\nFacts First: While Trump hasn\\'t issued any formal plan, he has made confusing comments about permanently \"eliminating\" the payroll tax that he has not clarified or corrected. His aides have argued that Trump is not proposing to eliminate the tax, but rather to forgive those payroll taxes that are currently being deferred. \\nYou can read more about the debate on this issue and what Trump has said here. \\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Columbia, South Carolina (CNN)In four years, Sen. Lindsey Graham has gone from Donald Trump\\'s cutting critic to his dogged defender, a bipartisan dealmaker respected by Senate Democrats to a staunch conservative reviled by liberals across the country.  \\nGraham has frustrated the left before but never paid the price in his red state of South Carolina. Now, the three-term senator is in the race of his life, facing an unexpectedly fierce challenge from his Democratic opponent, Jaime Harrison, whose insurgent campaign has raised and spent an unprecedented amount of cash. \\nThe race is tied, according to three recent polls. But Graham is banking that South Carolina will send him back to Washington for three reasons: His alliance with Trump, his vigorous defense of the President\\'s Supreme Court nominees and push to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett before Election Day, and his opponent\\'s party ID.  \\nIn the final weeks of the campaign, Graham is attempting to mar Harrison\\'s hope-and-change message by tying him down to unpopular Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \\n\"Here\\'s what I\\'m gonna tell all the liberals talking about South Carolina: We\\'re gonna kick your ass,\" Graham told a crowd full of police officers in Myrtle Beach last week.  \\nGraham, who first came to power in Washington by winning a House seat during the Republican Revolution of 1994, had been viewed as a shoo-in for reelection for much of the cycle. But Harrison has swamped Graham across the airwaves, with $51 million in money already spent in ads and in future ad reservations -- compared to just $18 million for Graham, according to Kantar\\'s Campaign Media Analysis Group. \\n\"I\\'ve been helping Trump, and I apparently pissed every liberal in the country off,\" Graham told CNN here in the state capital. \"But we\\'ll be fine.\"  \\nGraham\\'s relationship with Trump is a double-edged sword. While Graham has earned many of the President\\'s supporters, it has also opened him to charges of hypocrisy, going from calling Trump a \"race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot\" in 2015 to telling CNN in an interview this past weekend that the two are \"a team.\" \\n\"I don\\'t like it when people don\\'t have a stand on their issues,\" said Maggie Parker, a voter in Columbia, when asked about Graham.  \\nEven some of his supporters are critical of the shift. \\n\"I\\'d rather him be honest and not flip-flop,\" said Mike Jackson, a voter in Myrtle Beach who plans to vote the GOP line. \"That\\'s one of the things I\\'m not crazy about. I like for a man to be straightforward and stay that way -- not to turn out to be a yes man when his boss man turns up.\" \\nIn the interview, Graham was unapologetic about his shift, contending he has put his past disputes with Trump behind him.  \\n\"I accepted my defeat,\" Graham said, referring to his loss in the 2016 Republican presidential primary. \"President Trump won my state. I\\'ve been trying to help him where I can. He\\'s very popular in South Carolina.\"  \\nGraham also steered clear of any slight criticism of Trump. Asked about Trump\\'s own admission that he downplayed the coronavirus, held packed rallies during the pandemic, downplayed the wearing of masks and made repeated false claims that the virus would simply disappear, Graham instead defended the President\\'s actions.\\n\"I think he made the decisions,\" Graham said of Trump, pointing to restrictions on travel from China and ensuring ventilators were stocked up, a frequent argument made by the White House. \"I don\\'t think you want to get out there and say, \\'Hey, the whole country is going to blow up.\\'\"\\nPressed on whether Trump should have held packed campaign rallies and crowded White House events, like the one announcing the nomination of Barrett to the Supreme Court where few wore masks or isolated themselves, Graham said: \"People came, and I believe in wearing masks and they were social distancing.\"\\n\"It didn\\'t come out of Trump Tower; it came out of China,\" Graham said of the coronavirus. \\nSimilarly, asked if Trump has made his job harder -- like after he failed to condemn white supremacists at last week\\'s debate -- Graham didn\\'t answer directly. \\n\"All I can say about people of South Carolina is it\\'s not the color of your skin,\" pointing to Republican Sen. Tim Scott, a black Republican, and Nikki Haley, the former governor and daughter of Indian immigrants. \"So, it\\'s not about where you\\'re from in South Carolina or the color of your skin, it\\'s about your ideas.\" \\nHarrison\\'s plan: Rely on paid media \\nAs he\\'s gained traction in the race, Harrison has taken an increasingly low profile, sparingly doing media interviews and steering clear of public events. As a father of two young children and a pre-diabetic, Harrison has been cautious during the pandemic, even insisting on plexiglass to be placed beside him during Saturday\\'s debate and privately pushing for the debate to be held virtually up until the final hours before the event. \\nBut it\\'s also unclear how Harrison fills his time. His campaign would not provide a list of virtual events his aides said he\\'s been doing, despite many requests by CNN. And he refused to agree to an interview or answer questions from CNN before and after his debate with Graham. \\nMany voters in South Carolina say they have seen a lot of Harrison -- but only through his ads.\\n\"They have been blitzing us with ads back to back on YouTube, Spotify, you name it,\" said Lyric Swinton, a voter in Columbia. \"It\\'s just about everywhere it\\'s ads all across the state.\" \\nHarrison\\'s staggering spending prompts outside groups to jump in\\nDemocrats haven\\'t had success in South Carolina ever since Fritz Hollings retired fifteen years ago after nearly four decades in the Senate. In the six Senate elections since 2004, the Democratic candidate never cracked 45% of the vote. But Harrison may break that barrier in his race against Graham, boosted by an unprecedented level of financial support.  \\nIn his final campaign in 1998, Hollings raised $5.6 million. Harrison\\'s campaign reserved more than that -- over $9.3 million to be precise -- in ads the week beginning October 6, according to CMAG. To date, the Senate contest is the most expensive in South Carolina\\'s history.\\n\"Nobody\\'s ever had a race like this before,\" said Walter Whetsell, a spokesman for the pro-Graham Security Is Strength PAC.\\nHe said in South Carolina, statewide campaigns traditionally buy 8-10 weeks of television advertising at a cost between $2 million-$3 million dollars.  \\n\"He\\'s spending that damn near every two or three days,\" said Whetsell.\\nBombarded across the airwaves and facing tightening polls, Republican leaders are rushing to Graham\\'s defense. \\nThe Senate Leadership Fund, the Super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has upped its plans to spend in the race, spending or reserving $9.6 million in South Carolina, compared to $6 million in advertising from the Senate Majority PAC, the Super PAC aligned with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, according to CMAG. \\n\"The far-left money spigot has been turned on for liberal lobbyist Jamie Harrison, and now he\\'s flooding South Carolina with his liberal donors\\' funds,\" said SLF President Steven Law in a statement.  \\nJ.B. Poersch told CNN that the South Carolina race has been competitive for a long time.  \\n\"The problem with Lindsey Graham is nobody seems to trust him,\" Poersch said. \"That sentiment of not trusting Lindsey Graham knows no party.\" \\nTargeting suburban women\\nHarrison has to hope for a series of fortunate events to beat Graham. He has to bring out Democratic voters, while appealing to Republicans who are turned off by the senator in the Trump era.  \\nAmanda Loveday, a former executive director of the South Carolina Democratic Party, said Harrison \"has run the most effective Democratic statewide race that we\\'ve seen in modern history.\" \\nShe said that white suburban voters, especially women \"who are just tired of Trump,\" could \"determine how this election is won.\" \\nBoth campaigns are clearly targeting them. Harrison has aired one television ad featuring a woman named Robin from North Charleston, a former Graham supporter now attacking the senator for wanting to slash protections for those with pre-existing conditions like her. \"He might as well cut this tube,\" she says, holding onto what helps her breathe.  \\nAnother Harrison ad from another former Graham supporter, Melissa in Fort Mill, which is south of Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that the senator \"has changed\" and that it is now time for a change. \\nSecurity Is Strength has responded with one of its own ads featuring a young mother and teacher, Anna Coleman, who says, \"I want my family to be safe.\" She then attacks Harrison for being \"part of this liberal culture that is tearing our country apart.\" It then seeks to tie the Democratic candidate with the left\\'s defund the police effort, which Harrison rejects, showing images of mobs on the streets. \"I mean defund the police,\" says Coleman. \"That\\'s just crazy.\" \\nLoveday, the South Carolina Democratic strategist, said that one important factor in the Senate race is Bill Bledsoe, a Constitution Party candidate, whom she said will still be on the ballot in November, even though he dropped out last week and endorsed Graham. The last Democratic candidate to win a statewide race, South Carolina Superintendent of Education Jim Rex, defeated a Republican in 2006 by 455 votes when four third-party candidates also ran for the office. \\n\"That\\'s going to be huge for Jaime,\" said Loveday. \"[Bledsoe\\'s] name will appear on every ballot in the state of South Carolina. And if you vote for him, it could potentially determine the results of the election.\" \\nHarrison grew up poor in Orangeburg, and was raised by his grandparents before attending Yale University and Georgetown Law. He worked as a staffer for South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, led the state Democratic Party, and worked as a lobbyist with clients including Michelin, Boeing and the South Carolina Ports Authority. His message echoes Barack Obama\\'s slogans from 2008. \"It\\'s not about left versus right,\" says Harrison. \"It\\'s about right versus wrong.\" \\nGraham has attacked Harrison\\'s lobbying career, noting one of his clients was a hedge fund company that had previously sued Hurricane Katrina victims -- a charge Harrison\\'s campaign has called misleading since it was before Harrison worked on behalf of the company. \\nBut the senator\\'s overall message is that while Harrison is a liberal, Graham is going to ensure that Barrett will be confirmed this month. \\nYet even as Trump is more popular in South Carolina then he is in other states where vulnerable Republican senators are running, polls have shown a dip in the President\\'s standing here. Whether that\\'s enough to end Graham\\'s 26-year career in Congress is an open question.\\n\"I think we\\'re a team,\" Graham told CNN when asked if his fortunes were tied to Trump\\'s. \"Sometimes he says some things that are difficult to be honest with you. But Trump\\'s going to win this state because of his record. And I\\'m going to win because of my record. And this is a conservative state.\" \\nCNN\\'s David Wright contributed to this report.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Alexandra Martinez is an award-winning Cuban American writer based in Miami, Florida. Her work has appeared in Vice, Catapult Magazine, and Miami New Times. Find her at alexandra-martinez.net. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.\\n (CNN)On a blistering August morning in 1973, my grandparents, mom and aunt left Cuba. My maternal grandparents had met as a result of the Revolution; my abuela (grandmother) was a volunteer teacher in the literacy movement, and my abuelo (grandfather) was a technician and organizer who helped remove the previous dictator, Fulgencio Batista, and was exiled to Venezuela. \\n \\nAfter 1959, he was allowed to return and was celebrated by the Revolution. As the years passed, their living conditions and civil liberties withered. It became abundantly clear that Cuban dictator Fidel Castro would not uphold the rights of the people they had fought for. They spent five years being called gusanos (worms) while my abuelo labored in a forced-work agricultural camp to earn his family\\'s exit. When they were granted permission to leave, they left behind everything they had ever known: generations of family, their homes, and a bittersweet love for their island. Their only solace was the flickering thought that their young daughters would have a better life. \\n \\nToday, my 80-year-old abuela lives in her dream home in the predominantly Latino suburb of Miami, Kendall, a house she and my late abuelo built as the fruit of their decades of labor, wistful regret, and trauma after leaving their homeland. Her story is not unlike those of others in Miami\\'s Cuban-born community, which in 2017 accounted for more than a quarter of Miami-Dade County\\'s population and six percent of Florida\\'s voting power, according to 2016 exit polls.\\n \\nWe are a community that values democracy and freedom -- a community that historically has backed Republicans but whose best interests lie with Joe Biden, not Donald Trump. \\n \\nCuban Americans have leaned to the Republican Party, given its harder anti-communist line and its tougher stands on the Castro regime. After losing everything to Castro, older generations have clung on to America\\'s embargo on Cuba as a form of retribution. President Barack Obama\\'s moves to open ties with Cuba and thaw relations were met with skepticism.\\n \\nA fraught history\\n \\nThe relationship between Cuba and the US has been fraught since the Revolution. Beginning in 1961, when the Bay of Pigs invasion occurred, Castro and his government made sure his citizens knew they were under a constant threat of attack. My grandparents had just gotten married in Cuba and would soon give birth to their first daughter amid an atmosphere that my abuela refers to as \"eternally frenetic.\" One day she asked, \"When will things go back to normal everyday life?\" It wouldn\\'t.\\n \\nBy 1978, my grandparents were already living in Miami when President Jimmy Carter made the controversial decision to relax restrictions on travel to Cuba. My grandparents missed their family after five years away and saved money to go to the island. \\n \\nThey went in December 1979 and were treated like foreigners, obligated to rent a hotel even though they would sleep at their family\\'s centuries-old home in Marianao, a Havana neighborhood. My grandmother\\'s longing for her island life was met with a rude awakening: Everything had changed, she says. On their flight back to Miami, she closed the door to Cuba in her mind, deciding she would never return.\\n \\nMonths later, Castro released thousands of political prisoners, then convicted criminals, and other so-called \"undesirables\" as he deemed them, and Carter welcomed them to the US. The infamous \"Mariel Boatlift\" changed the political and social makeup of South Florida forever. A state of emergency was declared in Miami-Dade County. My grandparents were scared, uncertain about what would happen in a city already rife with civil unrest.\\n \\nOnce an agreement was reached between the two countries, Castro allowed familial visits to America. My grandmother was reluctant because she knew the money for the plane tickets would benefit the Castro government, but her desire to see her parents outweighed the former. Her parents came to meet their first great granddaughter who had just been born in August 1989, my sister. When my great grandparents returned to Cuba, they were met by the Special Period of economic crisis. Every aspect of Cuban life was affected, the people were struck with famine and medicine was scarce.\\n \\nYears later in 1999, I got my first lesson on US-Cuban relations when a young boy named Elian Gonzalez was found floating on an inner tube in the Straits of Florida. My school was canceled because of protests, my cousin\\'s birthday party called off -- my family had learned that anything having to do with Cuba was cause for alarm and extreme caution. What played out just a few miles away from my house was a petty game of politics, and the result is Gonzalez\\'s continued puppetry for the Castro/Diaz-Canel regime today.\\n \\nDespite growing up surrounded by Cuban culture, my understanding of Cuban politics was always vague and limited to extreme qualifications. In 2013, I was having dinner with a friend\\'s family. His parents asked me where my parents stood on the embargo; I realized I didn\\'t know. Like most things that had to do with Cuba, it wasn\\'t something my parents discussed at home, careful not to open old wounds. When I asked them, they were triggered, saying they were against it, after so many years of closure, clearly it wasn\\'t an effective policy. Vengeance is never the answer.\\n \\nBy January 2014, my interest in Cuba had been piqued after taking a Cuban cinema class at Columbia University. My professor idealized Cuba and its policies. Confused, I decided to visit the island, meet my family and conduct research for my senior essay. After just a week, I realized Cuba was not a socialist paradise, nor an apocalyptic nightmare. The truth as always lies with the unspoken people of Cuba, luchando (fighting) and just trying to get by.\\n \\nAlmost a year after my visit, Obama announced he was thawing ties. By then, my family welcomed a decision that months prior they, too, had been skeptical of. It is only by being in Cuba that you can really understand the necessity of exposure and open relations.\\n \\nGiven what my grandparents went through, it may be surprising that Cuban Americans would lend their support to Trump -- someone who loudly defies the traditional American values of democracy, rule of law, and freedom of speech that make the US so different from communist Cuba. But according to a 2016 National Election Pool exit poll, Cubans were about twice as likely as non-Cuban Latinos to vote for Trump in Florida, with 54% supporting him.\\n \\nThe 2020 battle for South Florida \\n \\nRecently, it has been reported that Trump\\'s polling throughout Miami\\'s Democratic enclave is outperforming his results from 2016. His $5.9 million spending in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale TV market has vastly surpassed Biden\\'s. The latter is now trying to make up ground with help from Mike Bloomberg, but Trump\\'s messaging has already targeted an especially vulnerable and impressionable group: Cuban immigrants with deeply ingrained trauma. \\n \\nMy abuela, a registered Independent, has never liked Trump, voted twice for Obama and once for Hillary Clinton. Since 2016, she has compared his jingoistic rhetoric to Fidel Castro\\'s. His crude behavior and sheer lack of morals have been nonnegotiable to her -- in her words, he brings shame to the White House, a place once known to her as \"the light of the world.\"\\n \\nBut she recently called me to announce that she was frustrated and not going to vote in the upcoming election because Joe Biden was plotting to reestablish ties with Cuba and would concede too much power to Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel. I knew immediately from the language she used this was likely messaging from Trump\\'s campaign, likening the entire Democratic Party to Castro\\'s communists.\\n \\nI told her that reestablishing ties with Cuba and picking up where Obama left off would actually benefit her. The future of her monthly Western Union remittances to her brother in Cuba have become uncertain due to the economic sanctions Trump has placed on the island. In June, the State Department announced it was adding Fincimex, a Cuban company controlled by the military which processes Western Union remittances, to its Cuba Restricted List. \\n \\nJust last year, Trump banned all flights to Cuba outside of Havana, causing an extreme decline in tourism. The Trump campaign claims to be punishing the Cuban government and military where it hurts the most, in their pockets. But, after a year, it is clear that the people who are hurting the most are the citizens of Cuba. \\n \\nTrump and his strategists have expertly pandered to my grandmother\\'s generation, who are jaded by Castro\\'s destruction of their homeland. Trump\\'s campaign has paid millions for TV ads on local and national Spanish stations and has even influenced Cuban millennial talk show hosts to evangelize his platform. The overarching aim has been to equate Democrats with their long-feared enemy: socialism.\\n \\nBut as explained by The New Yorker\\'s Masha Gessen, Cuba\\'s government is not an accurate example of socialism. The country\\'s well-defined wealthy class and stringent censorship make it a totalitarian regime. \\n \\nIn reality, Castro and Trump have more in common than they do differences. America\\'s police brutality and attacks on media most closely resembles Cuba today. When Cuban police killed a 27-year-old Black man, Hansel Hernandez in Guanabacoa, on June 24, activists organized a protest in Havana. The government\\'s response was a PR campaign with the Twitter hashtag #HeroesDeAzul (Heroes in Blue), an almost carbon copy of America\\'s #BlueLivesMatter campaign.\\n \\nMeanwhile, at the Republican National Convention, Trump invited Maximo Alvarez, a Cuban American businessman who arrived via the Pedro Pan Freedom Flights in 1961, two years after the start of Cuba\\'s 1959 Revolution. Alvarez said the current racial uprisings remind him of his home country in 1959 and compared Democrats to Castro.\\n \\nTrump is not the only Republican to have opposed Obama\\'s softening of America\\'s policies toward Cuba. But we can already see the effect of Trump\\'s decision to undo them. My cousin, a 29-year-old self-employed entrepreneur, has struggled to make enough for his growing family since tourism has declined under Trump\\'s harder line. Trump\\'s Cold War positions hurt people like my cousin, but not the intended targets like the country\\'s leaders.\\n \\nThe pandemic provides its own reasons for Cuban Americans in hard-hit Florida to oppose Trump. Miami\\'s working-class community of Hialeah, a 96% Hispanic enclave of more than 233,000 and home to more Cubans and Cuban Americans than anywhere else in the country, had the second highest preponderance of cases in the state in July. Without national leadership, it\\'s difficult to see a way out.\\n \\nTrump\\'s messaging sinks in\\n \\nStill, Cuban Americans like my abuela appear to be susceptible to Trump\\'s scare tactics. Perhaps because of her age, her demographic, even though she\\'s never subscribed, she receives almost daily emails from the Trump campaign. She spends her days watching Spanish television, where she watched Joe Biden say he would continue Obama\\'s Cuba rapprochement policy. The speech triggered in her a sense of humiliation and defeat -- reminding her of the pain she felt when she saw Obama be ridiculed by the Cuban regime during his 2016 visit, casually enjoying a baseball game, she says he was \"walked all over\" by Castro.\\n \\n\"The day Biden said he would continue Obama\\'s policy, se me cayó el techo encima,\" (It felt like my roof had fallen on top of me) she says.\\n \\nThe neutralization of the supposed \"enemy\" takes her back to the days of crowds of people yelling in the Plaza Civica (now called Plaza de la Revolucion), \"Fidel seguro, al Yankee dale duro!\"\\n \\nIf Cuban Americans don\\'t vote for Biden, it means squandering the health of our local community, as well as putting at risk the well-being of our families on the island. After our phone call, my grandmother realized she had let her deep-rooted trauma cloud her sense of judgment and recommitted to vote for Biden. \\n \\nI was shocked at first by my abuela\\'s declaration -- her moral imperative had always kept her away from Trump\\'s extremist rhetoric. I asked her if she understood the weight of that decision, how it could indirectly help elect Trump. She acknowledged that could happen and repeated that there simply was no good candidate to vote for. I reminded her that perhaps it seemed that way, but comparing Biden and Trump is like comparing day and night. She said that having never had the right to vote in Cuba, she could not waste her privilege as an American citizen to vote now and agreed that \"no hay otro remedio\" (there is no other choice) but Biden.\\n \\nIn this election, she is voting out of obligation. I hope more Cuban Americans can have the same conversations with their skeptical family members and help them realize that this election is not one to leisurely disengage from -- that it is our obligation as first-generation Cuban Americans to preserve the democracy our elders fought to bring us to; and the freedom so many still yearn for.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)Clare Bronfman, heiress to the Seagram liquor fortune, was sentenced to nearly seven years in prison Wednesday -- more than the five-year sentence prosecutors had recommended. \\nBronfman was remanded to custody shortly after the hearing. Her attorney told CNN she plans to appeal immediately. \\nBronfman, 41, is the first member of Nxivm, a company that marketed self-improvement programs, to be sentenced in the federal case that resulted in the cult-like group\\'s founder Keith Raniere being convicted of sex trafficking, racketeering, sexual exploitation of a child and human trafficking charges. \\nBronfman has spent the last two years in home confinement and was seen entering federal court in Brooklyn wearing a dark floral mask and clutching the hand of one of her attorneys. \\nBronfman was one of five co-conspirators indicted on racketeering charges in connection with Raniere\\'s case, but her sentence was in connection with two charges she pleaded guilty to in April 2019 which included conspiracy to conceal and harbor people who were not in the US legally for financial gain, as well as fraudulent use of identification. \\nWhile Bronfman pleaded guilty to those two charges, she has said she was not aware of the allegations of abuse surrounding a secret, all-female group within Nxivm known as DOS.  \\nUS District Judge Nicholas Garaufis said in his hour-long reading of her sentence, that while she was not convicted of racketeering, sex trafficking and other charges as Raniere was, her case was \"not about an isolated incident of credit card fraud or a run-of-the-mill case of harboring illegal aliens for financial gain.\"\\n\"Ms. Bronfman\\'s crimes were not committed in a vacuum,\" Garaufis said. \"They were committed in connection with her role in Nxivm and her close relationship with Raniere, and I believe that it would be inappropriate for me to consider them divorced from that context.\"\\nGaraufis also said he believes there may be aspects of Raniere\\'s crimes with which Bronfman \"very well may not have been familiar,\" and agreed with her defense team that evidence did not show she was aware of DOS before women began speaking publicly, alleging the group was a sex cult.  \\nDuncan Levin, an attorney for Bronfman, shared a statement with CNN shortly after her sentencing. \\n\"Clare expected to be punished for what she pleaded guilty to, but her conduct merits a far lower sentence,\" Levin said in the statement. \"Despite press reports to the contrary, the court did find that Clare did not fund a sex cult. She intends to mount a vigorous and immediate appeal.\" \\nSeth D. DuCharme, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York announced the sentence in a press release. \"Defendant Bronfman twisted our immigration system to serve a reprehensible agenda, and engaged in flagrant fraud to the detriment of her victims and in the service of a corrupt endeavor,\" DuCharme said in a statement. \"With today\\'s sentence, she has been held accountable for her crimes.\"\\nThe four other co-defendants in the case, who were high-ranking members of the organization, pleaded guilty last year to racketeering charges in connection with the case. \\nIn a letter to US District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in August, Bronfman said she was not involved with DOS, where members claimed they were forced to give damaging confessions, nude photos and potentially embarrassing information as \"collateral\" to maintain their vow of secrecy to the group. Women recruited into the group were known as \"slaves\" and each had \"masters,\" prosecutors said. Some former members of the group testified at Raniere\\'s trial that they were directed to have sex with Raniere, send him nude photos, and were even branded with his initials on their pelvic areas. \\n\"I did not and do not support anyone abusing or using violence towards anyone. I just tried to do what I thought was best to honor my role as a leader in NXIVM and a good friend,\" Bronfman said in her letter. \\n \\nDespite Raniere\\'s conviction, Bronfman said in her letter to the judge that she will not disavow Raniere or Nxivm.  \\n\"Many people, including most of my own family, believe I should disavow Keith and NXIVM, and that I have not is hard for them to understand or accept,\" Bronfman wrote in her letter. \"However, for me, NXIVM and Keith greatly changed my life for the better.\"\\nBronfman said in her letter that Raniere\\'s self-improvement teachings helped her overcome \"patterns of self-loathing, insecurities, shame and fears\" and that through Nxivm, she was able to find a community of friends that became like family to her. \\nBronfman will be housed at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, the same facility where Raniere is housed. He is expected to be sentenced Oct. 27. \\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)Over the summer, as racial justice demonstrations swept through American cities, President Donald Trump warned he would wield the powers of government to suppress violence. Embracing a \"law and order\" mantle, Trump himself announced from the East Room a surge of federal agents and castigated groups such as Black Lives Matter as cultivating \"hate.\"\\n\"My first duty as President is to protect the American people, and today I\\'m taking action to fulfill that sacred obligation,\" he declared.\\nA few months later, Trump\\'s only acknowledgment of his government taking down an alleged domestic terrorism plot to kidnap the Democratic governor of Michigan was to wonder why he hadn\\'t been thanked.\\nHow Trump chooses to promote his administration\\'s efforts to enforce \"law and order\" follow a clear pattern of political calculation; in instances when the Justice Department finds cases that bolster his claims of fraudulent voting, rampant urban crime or deep state corruption, Trump is eager to participate. He\\'s likely to reinforce the message about quelling violence on Saturday when he delivers remarks on \"law and order\" from a White House balcony to a crowd on the South Lawn.\\nBut when the government has worked to combat extremist anti-government groups -- which even his own FBI says present the most pressing threat to the nation -- Trump has at best ignored the efforts and at worst used them to fan the very resentments held by the groups\\' followers.\\nThe situation could only become more fraught as the election nears and as some extremist groups seek to retaliate against continued lockdown orders. Trump himself has railed against continued restrictions and has pointedly refused to call for post-election calm, even as he makes false claims about a rigged vote.\\nFormer officials and others familiar with the situation say Trump has demonstrated little interest in making efforts to combat domestic terrorism a priority for his administration, despite warnings from law enforcement officials, members of Congress and groups that track extremism about the increasing threat of extremist and far-right groups. Some have claimed White House officials attempted to suppress use of the phrase \"domestic terrorism\" altogether over the course of the Trump administration.\\nOthers said it was evident Trump recognized his own supporters were among those being labeled \"domestic terrorists\" and believed it would damage his standing with his base to warn of their danger. \\nAnimated instead by immigration enforcement and a crackdown on urban crime -- issues he believes galvanize his voters -- Trump has publicly downplayed the threat posed by armed militia groups and sought to focus attention elsewhere.\\nAfter the FBI investigated whether local officials in Pennsylvania improperly discarded ballots, Trump was briefed personally on the matter by Attorney General Bill Barr and revealed details of it during a Fox interview before they were made public.\\nHe has also taken enthusiastic and at times furious interest in the department\\'s work probing the origins of the Russia investigation, publicly encouraging Barr to \"move\" this week to bring criminal charges as the presidential election nears.\\nBut he hasn\\'t made broad or vocal appeals on combating domestic terrorism. In the hours of phone-in television interviews he conduced after the Michigan plot was revealed, Trump made barely a passing mention of it -- and only to bemoan the fact he wasn\\'t getting credit.\\n\"The President always wants to pick a side, and he wants to pick the side that supports him,\" said Miles Taylor, a former Homeland Security official in Trump\\'s administration who now opposes the President and is a CNN contributor. \"But Donald Trump has created, in my opinion, the favorable conditions that have allowed these domestic terrorist groups to rise.\"\\n\"The White House wanted to cover its eyes and wanted to cover its ears when it heard about domestic terrorism because they didn\\'t want to pay attention to the right-wing extremists that they saw as a potential base of support,\" Taylor said. \"As a consequence, the President\\'s rhetoric has served as a loaded gun for those groups who have since taken his words as sort of permission to do what they\\'re doing.\"\\nThe plot\\nOn Thursday, instead of specifically condemning the groups that allegedly hatched an elaborate plot to abduct Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and instigate a civil war, Trump went after the governor for not easing coronavirus restrictions in her state. \\n\"Gov. Whitmer of Michigan has done a terrible job. She locked down her state for everyone, except her husband\\'s boating activities,\" Trump tweeted. \"The Federal Government provided tremendous help to the Great People of Michigan. My Justice Department and Federal Law Enforcement announced today that they foiled a dangerous plot against the Governor of Michigan. Rather than say thank you, she calls me a White Supremacist—while Biden and Democrats refuse to condemn Antifa, Anarchists, Looters and Mobs that burn down Democrat run cities.\"\\nBefore his tweet, Whitmer had accused Trump of fomenting conditions that allowed groups such as Wolverine Watchmen -- whose members were charged on Thursday -- to flourish.\\n\"Just last week, the President of the United States stood before the American people and refused to condemn white supremacists and hate groups like these two Michigan militia groups,\" Whitmer said, claiming those who were plotting to kidnap her had \"heard the President\\'s words not as a rebuke but as a rallying cry -- as a call to action.\"\\nTrump, meanwhile, insisted he did not endorse anything the group did, even as he accused Whitmer of angering citizens of her state by maintaining coronavirus lockdowns.\\n\"I do not tolerate ANY extreme violence,\" he wrote. \"Defending ALL Americans, even those who oppose and attack me, is what I will always do as your President! Governor Whitmer—open up your state, open up your schools, and open up your churches!\"\\nHe wrote the message while recovering from coronavirus himself at the White House. It echoed Trump\\'s calls over the summer for Whitmer to reverse restrictions on businesses and gatherings meant to prevent coronavirus from spreading.\\nRight-wing groups have protested Whitmer\\'s pandemic response since early in the crisis, when thousands of people -- some of them armed -- gathered at the state capitol in Lansing to demand she reverse executive orders that shut down much of the state.\\nTrump sided with those protesters, many of whom arrived to the capitol waving Trump flags. He tweeted \"LIBERATE MICHIGAN\" and said those agitating for looser rules were \"very good people, but they are angry.\"\\nProtesters\\nTwo months later, Trump took the opposite view of protesters demanding justice after the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man who died in police custody in Minnesota. Trump ordered an outsized federal response to the demonstrations, which spread to cities across the country.\\nThe President was responding to criticism from his allies that he appeared weak as some of the protests turned violent. But the crackdown generated fierce backlash, particularly after chemical agents were used to clear a park across from the White House so Trump could stage a photo-op outside a church.\\nAs protests have continued in some cities, Trump has sided with groups that have sought to quell the violence themselves. He defended a caravan of his supporters who drove into Portland, Oregon, and fired paintball guns at protesters, calling them \"peaceful protesters\" and claiming they were using paintballs as \"a defensive mechanism.\"\\nHe has also defended Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old who is accused of fatally shooting two people during protests over the police shooting of another unarmed Black man, Jacob Blake.\\nSocial media accounts believed to belong to Rittenhouse portray a young White man with an affinity for guns who supports \"Blue Lives Matter\" and Trump. Asked if he agreed with armed vigilantes like Rittenhouse taking to the streets, Trump said he\\'d \"like to see law enforcement take care of everything,\" but didn\\'t condemn vigilantism.\\nThe issue seemed to reach a zenith during the first presidential debate, when Trump declined to specifically condemn the Proud Boys, a far-right group whose ideology has been labeled \"misogynistic, Islamophobic, transphobic, and anti-immigration\" by the Anti-Defamation League. \\nInstead, Trump told the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by,\" a phrase later co-opted by the group in memes and social media posts. \\n\\u200bIn online statements, Proud Boys have claimed they have only used violence in self-defense. But members are often seen carrying firearms, bats and donning protective gear\\u200b, and some have been convicted of crimes against anti-fascist protesters. Their supporters have been seen at recent protests across the US, including in Portland.\\nLater, Trump insisted he\\'d never heard of the Proud Boys. After days of backlash, he finally said he condemned them in an interview on Fox. But that did not seem to dampen the group\\'s support for him; its founder joined a vigil for the President outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Center over the weekend.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)President Donald Trump on Saturday said he is nominating Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative federal appeals court judge, to succeed the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the US Supreme Court, setting off a fierce partisan battle in the waning days of a hotly contested presidential election.\\nCalling it a \"very proud moment indeed,\" Trump called Barrett a woman of \"towering intellect\" and \"unyielding loyalty to the Constitution\" who would rule \"based solely on the fair reading of the law.\" \\nIn a flag-bedecked Rose Garden designed to mimic Ginsburg\\'s own nomination ceremony in 1993, Trump recounted Barrett\\'s educational and professional background, noted her seven children and hailed her ties to another late Supreme Court justice, Antonin Scalia, for whom she clerked.\\n\"I looked and I studied and you are very eminently qualified for this job,\" Trump told his nominee. \"You are going to be fantastic.\"\\nBarrett, Trump declared before an audience that included Scalia\\'s widow, Republican senators and several figures from the conservative media, is \"one of our nation\\'s most brilliant and gifted legal minds.\"\\nIn her own remarks, Barrett offered only a glimpse of what type of justice she would be and did not delve into specifics.\\n\"A judge must apply the law as written,\" she said. \"Judges are not policy makers.\"\\nInstead she sought to cast herself as a public servant -- one who, at 48, could potentially serve on the court for decades.\\n\"If confirmed, I would not assume that role for the sake of those in my own circle, and certainly not for my own sake, I would assume this role to serve you,\" she said.\\nThe nomination comes at a critical time in history, as the President openly questions the integrity of the upcoming election and has not committed to a peaceful transfer of power in the event he loses. He\\'s repeatedly said that the Supreme Court needed to have all nine seats filled ahead of Election Day, in case the court needed to weigh in on the legality of mail-in ballots being sent to Americans across the country amid the coronavirus pandemic. And several weighty cases loom on the immediate horizon, should she be confirmed as swiftly as Republicans hope, including one that could determine the fate of the Affordable Care Act.\\nTrump seemed to momentarily shrug off the looming battle, even if Barrett herself said Saturday she was under no illusions about how difficult her confirmation might be.\\n\"This should be a straightforward and prompt confirmation,\" Trump said. \"I\\'m sure it will be extremely non-controversial. We said that last time, didn\\'t we?\"\\nBut Democrats were already writing off her nomination, which had been widely expected.\\n\"By nominating Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, President Trump has once again put Americans\\' healthcare in the crosshairs,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a statement, adding a vote for Barrett amounted to \"a vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act.\"\\nBarrett was appointed by Trump to the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017 and advocates on the right have backed her nomination because of her writings on faith and the law. The 7th Circuit is based in Chicago and covers cases from Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin. If her Senate confirmation is successful before the November election, the appointment would mark Trump\\'s third US Supreme Court pick in one presidential term, cementing a conservative stronghold in the court for a generation. \\nBarrett graduated from -- and now works part-time as a professor at -- Notre Dame Law School. She was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, and now lives in South Bend, Indiana, with her husband Jesse M. Barrett.\\nFollowing Ginsburg\\'s death last week, Trump expressed eagerness to appoint her replacement, arguing that he had a constitutional duty to fill her seat and committed to appointing a female nominee. Barrett will be the fifth woman ever appointed to the court and second conservative, if confirmed.\\nIn the week Trump deliberated his latest Supreme Court choice, Barrett, once a finalist for the Supreme Court spot that went to Brett Kavanaugh in 2018, emerged as the favorite among his shortlist, after meeting with the President at the White House, according to sources familiar. \\nBarrett\\'s Senate nomination process is set to begin swiftly as conservatives aim to seat her before Election Day. \\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham said that Barrett\\'s confirmation hearing would begin Monday, October 12, according to a statement released Saturday night.\\nTwo Republican senators have said they do not support voting on the nomination of a Supreme Court justice ahead of the election, but now that Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney has signaled that he is on board with moving ahead with a vote, Barrett\\'s likely to be confirmed barring any potential missteps.\\nLegal philosophy\\nSince joining the appellate bench, Barrett has been a cautious jurist, plainly aware that she remains under a national microscope for any Supreme Court confirmation battle. Still, she has demonstrated her conservative bona fides on Second Amendment gun rights, immigration and abortion -- positions Democrats are poised to voice opposition against in upcoming confirmation hearings. \\nLast year, she dissented alone when a 7th Circuit panel majority rejected a Second Amendment challenge from a man found guilty of felony mail fraud and prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal and Wisconsin law.\\nIn 2018, she joined a dissent with fellow conservatives in an Indiana abortion dispute and referred to a provision that made it unlawful for physicians to perform an abortion because of the race, sex or disability of the fetus was a \"eugenics statute.\" \\nMore recently in June, she dissented as a 7th Circuit panel left intact a US district court decision temporarily blocking a Trump policy that disadvantaged green card applicants who apply for any public assistance.\\nAnd religious conservatives were especially energized by an exchange with Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, during Barrett\\'s 2017 confirmation hearing for her current judgeship. \\nIn a tense back-and-forth, the Democratic senator sharply questioned whether the judicial nominee could separate her Catholic views from her legal opinions. \\n\"The conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you,\" Feinstein pointedly said. \"And that\\'s of concern when you come to big issues that large numbers of people have fought for years in this country.\" \\nBarrett supporters believed the nominee was being disparaged for her Catholicism. But Democrats said the exchange was in reference to Barrett\\'s own writings on the topic that had prompted questions from both parties -- and concerns from progressives that she would chip away at abortion rights.\\nAt the hearing, Barrett testified that her religious beliefs would not interfere with her rulings as a federal judge. But Democrats, including Feinstein, were not convinced, worried that Barrett\\'s views meant that she would strike against abortion rights as a federal judge.\\nShould Barrett be confirmed before Election Day or shortly thereafter, one of her earliest cases would be on the latest Obamacare challenge. The court is scheduled to hear that case on November 10.\\nBarrett has also cast doubt on the Affordable Care Act, authoring a 2017 law review essay which criticized Chief Justice John Roberts\\' legal rationale for saving the law. \\nThis story has been updated to include confirmation of the October 12 hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee.\\nCNN\\'s Joan Biskupic, Manu Raju, Gregory Clary and Christian Sierra contributed to this report.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump said his coronavirus infection was a \"blessing from God\" because it educated him about potential drugs to treat the disease in a video meant to demonstrate his return to work after several days in the hospital.\\nThe appearance, his first since returning from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, was taped Wednesday afternoon in the Rose Garden by White House staff. Trump seemed upbeat, but his voice still sounded breathless at points and he appeared to be wearing make-up.\\nParts of the video looked edited. In it, Trump framed his ongoing bout with the virus as a net positive.\\n\"I think this was a blessing from God that I caught it. It was a blessing in disguise,\" he said, citing his first-hand experience with the experimental combination of drugs he was administered at Walter Reed.\\nHe singled out in particular the high dose of an experimental antibody cocktail from Regeneron, saying he requested it from his doctors and attributing his recovery to its effects.\\nCalling the drug a \"cure,\" Trump said he would work to make it available at no cost to other Americans. \\n\"I want everybody to be given the same treatment as your President,\" Trump said, adding: \"It was, like, unbelievable.\"\\nHe also seemed downbeat at the prospects of a vaccine before Election Day, saying political maneuvering had stymied progress.\\n\"I think we should have it before the election and, frankly, the politics get involved,\" he said.\\nThe video was the first time Trump had been seen since returned from Walter Reed on Monday evening. While he taped a video on Tuesday from the White House residence, it was never released.\\nThe White House said earlier in the day he was being briefed on a looming hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico and stimulus talks in the Oval Office, though Trump himself scrapped talks on additional aid a day earlier. \\nOval Office return\\nUnsatisfied with the temporary office space erected for him in the White House residence, where he was isolating after returning from three days in the hospital, Trump had been itching to return to the Oval Office since Tuesday but aides convinced him to stay put.\\nFew seemed to believe, however, that Trump would last much longer isolating in his private quarters. \\nIn a new memo released midday Wednesday, Trump\\'s doctor relayed the President saying \"I feel great!\" and reported he had been symptom-free for 24 hours. But the memo declined again to provide critical information such as when Trump last tested negative, what his lung scans show and whether he is still on the steroid dexamethasone or any other medications that could be masking his symptoms.\\nTrump\\'s \"schedule right now is fluid, we\\'re looking at his prognosis,\" chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters earlier at the White House. \"If he decides to go to the Oval, we\\'ve got safety protocols there.\"\\nIndeed, preparations had been made for Trump\\'s eventual return to the Oval Office, including positioning a so-called \"isolation cart\" stocked with yellow medical gowns, respirator masks and plastic goggles required for visitors just outside the office doors near where Trump\\'s assistants sit. \\nWhen he did return, Trump avoided other areas of the Wing Wing, entering the Oval Office directly from outside. Meadows and social media adviser Dan Scavino joined him there dressed in the protective gear. It wasn\\'t clear who else he might have encountered along the way. \\nTrump made phone calls and spoke with aides mostly from his third-floor quarters on Tuesday and a taped a video -- never released -- from downstairs where offices were set up for him next to the medical suite.\\nWhat we do know about his health\\nAll except Trump\\'s senior-most aides are mostly in the dark about his health status beyond what his doctor released publicly. While he seemed short of breath at times on Monday night, people said he seemed somewhat better on Tuesday, though few actually saw him in person. \\nIn his memo on Wednesday, White House physician Dr. Sean Conley wrote Trump \"has not needed nor received any supplemental oxygen since initial hospitalization\" and said he has been \"fever-free for more than 4 days,\" but did not say whether Trump was currently receiving any medications which could lower a fever.\\nTrump\\'s labs, he said, \"demonstrated detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies from labs drawn Monday.\" \\nRegeneron, the company that makes the experimental antibody treatment given to Trump on Friday, said the test likely showed evidence of the treatment, not Trump\\'s own immune response.\\nOver the weekend, Trump\\'s physician said days seven to 10 after Trump\\'s diagnosis could be the most critical, a window that seemed to open on Wednesday. The White House continued to refuse to disclose when Trump last tested negative for coronavirus, throwing into doubt the extensive testing regimen they had long pointed to as their main protection against the virus.  \\nIt also wasn\\'t clear which drugs the President continues to take. He was due to receive his final dose of remdesivir on Tuesday night at the White House but it wasn\\'t known if he remains on a steroid, which some inside the building have openly speculated could be altering his mood. \\nAny aide who comes near Trump is required to don protective garb, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The appointments of Wolf and his No. 2, Ken Cuccinelli, to the top leadership roles in the Department of Homeland Security have increasingly come under scrutiny, though both continue to serve in their posts.

The second rule would eliminate the longstanding requirement that employment authorization applications be processed within 30 days, thus allowing such applications to sit untouched indefinitely,\" James\\' office said.\\nXinis found that DHS \"completely sidestepped this critical impact of the new rules\" and \"never wrestled with the fundamental implications of deferring or denying advance work authorization.\"\\n\"Substantially limiting approval of work authorization for bona fide asylees will inevitably affect their ability to afford the costs of seeking asylum, including hiring legal counsel,\" Xinis wrote.\\nXinis\\' order granted injunctive relief to only members of Casa de Maryland, Inc. and Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, two of the lawsuit\\'s plaintiffs that the judge found to have \"demonstrated associational standing at this stage,\" finding the relief \"both proper and necessary to avoid irreparable harm.\"\\nThe organizations have approximately 100,000 and 4,000 members each, according to the judge\\'s order.\\nJames welcomed the ruling, calling Wolf a man with \"no authority and no business sitting in the chair of the acting secretary of Homeland Security.\"\\n\"Not only is this decision welcome news for asylum seekers who were unfairly targeted by the Trump Administration, but the courts have now found that Chad Wolf has no authority at the Department of Homeland Security,\" she said.\\nCNN has previously reported that the Government Accountability Office found that Wolf and Cuccinelli, the senior official performing the duties of deputy secretary, were appointed as part of an invalid order of succession.\\n\"We vehemently disagree with what the GAO has put out,\" Wolf told CNN\\'s Jake Tapper at the time.\\nWolf has been at the forefront of a host of issues like immigration, civil unrest and the coronavirus pandemic response, and as a result, has come under criticism for his actions.

But he did co-found the alternative magazine that grew into what Vice Media is today, and he worked at Vice for 14 years. \\nMcInnes, along with Shane Smith and Suroosh Alvi, bought Voice of Montreal, a magazine funded by the Canadian government, in 1994. According to a profile in The Guardian in 2008, the three took control of the magazine after a falling out with the publisher. They changed the name to Vice and later moved to New York City and expanded the magazine internationally. \\nMcInnes, under aliases, wrote much of the content for Vice in its early days before they had a budget for freelancers, according to a New Yorker profile in 2013. He also co-authored several Vice books.\\nIn a profanity-laced Q&A with New York Press in 2002, McInnes said he was glad that hipsters in Williamsburg, the Brooklyn neighborhood where Vice is headquartered, were White. After a letter writing campaign by a Black reader, Vice apologized for McInnes\\' comment, The New York Times later reported. He was also quoted by the Times saying, \"I love being white and I think it\\'s something to be very proud of. I don\\'t want our culture diluted. We need to close the borders now and let everyone assimilate to a Western, white, English-speaking way of life.\\'\\' An unnamed ex-staffer told The New Yorker \"[t]hat was the beginning of the end\" of McInnes\\' time with Vice.\\nBy the time McInnes left Vice in 2008, the company had invested in creating digital video and gained notoriety for its provocative documentaries. Vice was on its way to becoming a darling of media investors that would, at its likely high-water mark in 2017, be valued at $5.7 billion. McInnes left \"because of creative differences with his partners,\" according to The New York Times. \\nMcInnes founded the Proud Boys in 2016. He quit in 2018, but in 2019 sued the Southern Poverty Law Center for designating the organization a hate group.  Officially, the group describes themselves as being organized around the belief that \"West Is The Best\" — what they call Western Chauvinism — and reject the label of White supremacists and alt-right. They say they oppose both racism and \"racial guilt.\" They advocate for closed borders, gun rights, and \"venerating the housewife.\" In a statement to CNN Business Thursday, McInnes rejected the notion that the Proud Boys are racists or White supremacists.\\nCurrent Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio told CNN\\'s Elle Reeve, who previously worked at Vice, that he was happy about the President\\'s comment for the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by.\"\\nIn Wednesday\\'s staff memo, Dubuc wrote, \"I hope that our work, our culture and our leadership speak for itself unequivocally, but let me say - to leave no shred of doubt - we all condemn white supremacy, racism and hate in every form.\"\\nVice has also extensively covered the Proud Boys and other far-right groups, Dubuc noted. \\n\"Our award-winning teams have led the charge in holding the Proud Boys and other similar groups accountable through dogged and unflinching investigative journalism. Our teams have produced world-class reporting on the alt-right from Charlottesville to Louisville and most recently Portland,\" Dubuc wrote. \"I thank you for your unwavering commitment to continuing this work - and if anyone gives you a hard time, send them my way. I\\'m happy to set the record straight.\"\\nVice Media declined to comment beyond Dubuc\\'s email. \\nWhen CNN Business reached out to McInnes by text message about what Dubuc had written, he replied saying, \"I created that brand and defined the content from its inception to when I left in 2008.

In 2017, after the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed, the President said that there were \"some very fine people on both sides.\"\\nThe year before, David Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, endorsed Trump. Trump\\'s response: \"Well, just so you understand, I don\\'t know anything about David Duke, OK? I don\\'t know anything about what you\\'re even talking about with White supremacy or White supremacists.\"\\nEven beyond not bringing himself to outright condemn White supremacy, everything Trump had to say -- or not -- to Black voters on Tuesday tells you that few believe those who say that he\\'s not racist.\\nThe debate billed one segment as being about \"race and violence in our cities,\" a facile framing that was intended to lead to a conversation about race and the anti-Black police violence that\\'s brought protesters to the streets.\\nInstead of discussing those topics, though, Trump deflected and sought sanctuary in his usual talking points: Biden\\'s endorsement of the 1994 crime bill, gauzy appeals to patriotism and \"law and order.\" Not once did he grapple with the reality of systemic racism.\\nIn the summer of 2016, Trump made a crass pitch to Black voters in the predominantly White suburb of Dimondale, Michigan, urging them to take a chance on his campaign.\\n\"You\\'re living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed -- what the hell do you have to lose?\" he asked.\\nOn Tuesday, Black voters seemed to get their answer, as they have so many times over the past four years, as an updated Proud Boys logo circulated online. On it was the President\\'s \"stand by\" remark.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Washington (CNN)Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed on Friday that whomever President Donald Trump nominates to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will get a vote on the Senate floor, signaling a historic fight in Congress over one of the most polarizing issues in American politics.\\n\"President Trump\\'s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate,\" McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said in a statement Friday evening that sets GOP lawmakers on a collision path with Democrats, though the exact timing of such a fight -- in particular how much of it would happen ahead of or after Election Day -- was not immediately clear.\\nSenate Majority Whip John Thune, the number two GOP senator, backed McConnell, saying in a statement of his own, \"I believe Americans sent a Republican president and a Republican Senate to Washington to ensure we have an impartial judiciary that upholds the Constitution and the rule of law. We will fulfill our obligation to them. As Leader McConnell has said, President Trump\\'s Supreme Court nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\"\\nGOP aides are skeptical that there is enough time to confirm a nominee before November 3, given that Supreme Court nominees typically take two to three months to process, according to a review of recent confirmation proceedings. \\nBut that process could be sped up if McConnell, who controls the majority of the chamber, has the votes to confirm a replacement, and there is enough time to confirm someone in a lame-duck session of Congress after the November elections.\\nThat calculation is further complicated if Republicans lose control of the Senate and the White House after the election -- and whether enough GOP senators would break ranks and oppose any nominee by a President who had just lost his election and a GOP Senate that just lost its majority.\\nSenate Republicans, who hold the majority in the upper chamber, only need 51 votes to confirm a new justice once one is formally nominated. Currently, there are 53 GOP senators -- meaning they can only lose three Republicans. In the event of a 50-50 split, Vice President Mike Pence could cast a tie-breaking vote.\\nAlready, Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine have said that there is not enough time to confirm someone before November.\\nCollins told The New York Times earlier this month that she\\'d oppose seating a nominee in a lame-duck session if Joe Biden wins the White House.\\nIt\\'s unclear if more Republicans would break ranks.\\nCNN has reached out to Collins, Murkowski and Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah -- among others -- to seek their position on the matter.\\nIn a message to GOP senators on Friday, McConnell urged his colleagues not to lock themselves into a position that they may regret later and counseled them to be cautious about what they are telling the media about their views on how to process the nomination, according to a person who saw the note. He urged them to \"keep your powder dry.\"\\nMcConnell did not indicate a timeframe for considering the nomination but made clear he believes there\\'s enough time to take up the nominee this year.\\nWhile GOP Senate sources believe action on a nominee will likely wait until a post-election, lame-duck session of Congress, it\\'s possible it could be moved up for this reason: The possibility of court fights over the election results and the need for nine justices on the court to resolve any disputes.\\nA GOP Senate source said that this topic will be under discussion with senators as they decide whether to fast-track a nominee before November.\\nIn July, Republican leaders signaled they would confirm a nominee this year. \\n\"We will,\" said Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Republican leader, when asked if the Senate would fill a vacancy, even during the lame-duck session after the presidential election. \"That would be part of this year. We would move on it.\"\\nBut Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham wasn\\'t sure if he would agree to that.\\n\"I\\'d like to fill a vacancy. But we\\'d have to see. I don\\'t know how practical that would be,\" Graham told CNN in July. \"Let\\'s see what the market would bear.\"\\nMcConnell\\'s vow that a nominee would get a vote set up a clash with the top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer of New York, who said earlier Friday that a Supreme Court vacancy \"should not be filled until we have a new president.\"\\n\"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,\" the top Senate Democrat tweeted in a reference to a statement made by McConnell in 2016 after the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. \\nGinsburg died on Friday due to complications of metastatic pancreas cancer, the court announced. She was 87.\\nEarlier this year, McConnell reiterated his position that the GOP-led Senate would confirm a nominee to any Supreme Court vacancy that occurred this election year, despite leaving a seat vacant in 2016 and preventing President Barack Obama\\'s nominee from consideration.\\nGraham expressed his condolences over Ginsburg\\'s passing Friday evening. \\n\"It was with great sadness that I learned of the passing of Justice Ginsburg. Justice Ginsburg was a trailblazer who possessed tremendous passion for her causes. She served with honor and distinction as a member of the Supreme Court,\" the Republican South Carolina senator tweeted.\\nHe went on to say, \"While I had many differences with her on legal philosophy, I appreciate her service to our nation. My thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends. May she Rest In Peace.\" \\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Friday evening that flags over the US Capitol building are flying at half staff in honor of the late justice. \\nIn a statement, Pelosi said, \"We must honor Justice Ginsburg\\'s trailblazing career and safeguard her powerful legacy by ensuring that the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court upholds her commitment to equality, opportunity and justice for all. \"\\nGinsburg was appointed in 1993 by President Bill Clinton and in recent years served as the most senior member of the court\\'s liberal wing, consistently delivering progressive votes on the most divisive social issues of the day, including abortion rights, same-sex marriage, voting rights, immigration, health care and affirmative action.\\nOne additional element that might impact the looming nomination fight is the Arizona special election. \\nThe Arizona Republic is reporting that if Democratic Senate candidate Mark Kelly wins a November 3 special election against GOP Sen. Martha McSally, he could be sworn-in as soon as November 30, meaning the balance of power in the Senate would shift from the current 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats to 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats.\\nThat difference could impact the ability of McConnell to confirm a replacement for Ginsburg given that some GOP senators have expressed reluctance to filling a Supreme Court vacancy during a presidential election year.\\nThe newspaper makes clear, however, that getting Kelly sworn in then is not a done deal and may be contested, saying, \"Two Republican and Democratic election attorneys agree that state law and Senate practice would make Kelly eligible to take over the seat once held by Sen. John McCain as soon as Nov. 30, when the state election results are expected to be canvassed.\"\\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Friday.\\nCNN\\'s Alex Rogers, Veronica Stracqualursi and Joan Biskupic contributed to this report. \\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)Members of the far-right group the Proud Boys are celebrating comments made by President Donald Trump after he was asked \\u200bto condemn White supremacists, and refused to do so, during Tuesday\\'s presidential debate.\\nThe President instead used \\u200bhis allotted time to blame \\u200bwhat he called \"antifa and the left\\u200b\" for violence and to tell the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by.\" \\u200b\\n\\u200bShortly after Trump\\'s answer, his words were embraced in memes and other social media posts by accounts that purported to be from Proud Boys members. \\nSome emblazoned the \\u200bphrase \"stand back and stand by\" onto the group\\'s logos. Others treated the President\\u200b\\'s choice of the words \"stand by\" as a sort of rallying cry -- and have since been promoting it. Now, they\\'re turning it into profit by selling merchandise with the comment on it. \\u200b\\nCNN\\'s Elle Reeve spoke with Enrique Tarrio, the group\\'s leader, who said while he was happy about the President\\'s comments, he doesn\\'t see it as an endorsement.\\nTarrio said he interpreted \"stand back and stand by\" as meaning they should just keep doing what they\\'re doing.\\nAlthough it claims a diverse membership -- Tarrio says he is Cuban American -- the Proud Boys group \\u200blists among its central tenets a belief in \"closed borders\" and the aim of \"reinstating a spirit of Western chauvinism.\"\\n\\u200bIn online statements, Proud Boys have claimed they have only used violence in self-defense. But members are often seen carrying firearms, bats and donning protective gear\\u200b, and some have been convicted of crimes against anti-fascist protesters. \\n\\u200bThe group\\'s ideology has been labeled \"misogynistic, Islamophobic, transphobic, and anti-immigration\" by the Anti-Defamation League.\\nTheir supporters have been seen at recent protests across the US, including in Portland.\\nTuesday\\'s debate also provided another example of Trump dodging and deflecting an opportunity to condemn White supremacist groups within the United States.\\nThe day after the debate, Trump claimed he had no idea who the Proud Boys were. He also, again, refused to explicitly condemn White supremacists before repeating his call for his Democratic rival Joe Biden to denounce Antifa.\\nIt also provided further fuel for Biden\\'s claims that the President has emboldened right-wing extremist groups since the 2017 \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia\\u200b, in which a neo-Nazi drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one woman. \\nBiden has frequently cited Trump\\'s response to that as \\u200bmotivating him to run for the presidency.\\nIn response to the violence, the President said at the time that there were \"very fine people on both sides\" of the protests, which included White supremacists.\\nWho are the Proud Boys?\\nThe group was created by Gavin McInnes, a co-founder of Vice, in 2016, according to a Proud Boys website.\\nBefore he quit the group in late 2018, McInnes said in a speech that the Proud Boys weren\\'t going to pick fights, \"but if they pick fights with us, we\\'re going to finish them.\"\\n\"Violence doesn\\'t feel good,\" he said in the same speech. \"Justified violence feels great and fighting solves everything.\"\\nThe Anti-Defamation League, citing videos posted to social media from McInnes\\' radio show, says he has previously posted videos of him\\u200bself giving the Nazi salute, saying, \"Heil Hitler,\" defending Holocaust deniers and repeatedly using racial and anti-Semitic slurs. They say despite the videos, McInnes has refuted claims that he is anti-Semitic and racist.\\nCNN has reached out to McInnes\\' lawyer about the videos but has not yet received a response.  \\n\"We\\'re a drinking club with a patriot problem,\" Tarrio, the group\\'s current leader, told CNN. \"As Proud Boys, I think our main objective is to defend the West\\u200b,\" \\u200bhe said.\\n\"If our mere presence causes people to want to commit acts of violence, we\\'re not afraid to defend ourselves,\" Tarrio said.\\nOn one of its websites, the group calls \\u200bitself \"men who refuse to apologize for creating the modern world.\"\\nIn 2019, two members of the Proud Boys were convicted on assault charges, including attempted gang assault, for \\u200battacking \\u200banti-fascist protesters. \\n\\u200b\\u200bSome members of the group appear to have connections to the President\\'s longtime friend and political adviser Roger Stone\\u200b, according to Stone\\'s testimony for his 2019 criminal case related to the Russia investigation. During that trial, Stone testified that some Proud Boys members helped run his social media accounts. \\u200b\\nOn July 8, Facebook removed Stone\\'s \\u200bInstagram and a network of pages linked to him on its platforms because they were linked to the Proud Boys, which have been banned from the social media platform under its hate policies.\\nMembers of the group also attended Stone\\'s court hearings.\\nWhat the President said during debate\\nThe President had been asked by the moderator Chris Wallace if he would condemn White \\u200bsupremacists and militia groups.\\n\"I\\'m willing to do that,\" the President said, without condemning anyone. \"I\\'m willing to do anything. I want to see peace.\"\\nAfter the initial question, Wallace and Biden both prodded him to condemn White supremacy and Trump appeared to deflect and dodge that, saying \\u200b\"almost everything\" of the violence \\u200bhe\\'s seen has been from \\u200b\"Antifa and the left.\"\\n\"What do you want to call them,\" the President said. \"Give me a name. Give me a name. Who would you like me to condemn?\"\\nBiden then mentioned the Proud Boys, which Trump seized on.\\n\"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by,\" he said. \"Somebody has to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem, this is a left-wing.\"\\nIn recent Senate testimony, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that the FBI views Antifa as \"more of an ideology or a movement than an organization.\" Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, testified that White supremacists pose the most lethal terror threat to the nation.\\nCNN\\'s Elle Reeve, Sara Sidner, Marshall Cohen, Julia Vargas Jones and Samantha Guff contributed to this report.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Justin Gest (@_JustinGest) is an associate professor at George Mason University\\'s Schar School of Policy and Government and the author of \"The New Minority: White Working Class Politics in an Age of Immigration and Inequality.\" The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\\n (CNN)An aura of political mystery swirls around swing states.\\nLike trade winds for ancient sailors, swing states are pivotal but seem unpredictable. \"Where will they go this time?\" ask millions of political onlookers every four years.\\nThe very word \"swing\" suggests vacillation and a propensity to move independently from other, more consistently partisan populations, but the political orientations among voters in swing states are not so different from deeply red and blue states.\\nWhat makes swing states unique is that the demographic distribution of Democratic-leaning and Republican-leaning voters is more balanced -- making election results less predictable. \\nAccording to Gallup, which tracks the partisan tilt of different US regions, four out of every five states lean substantially to one side or the other. Only 10 states feature a partisan advantage of five percentage points or less, and they attracted nearly all public events featuring the candidates in 2016. In this series, CNN Opinion focuses on some of these battlegrounds -- including Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Texas, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\\nDespite the high stakes that bring these swing states to everyone\\'s attention, three major political dynamics reveal the way they are just as extreme, just as polarized and just as interconnected as the rest of the country.\\nFirst, swing states are not loaded with moderates.\\nModerate voters are thought to be rare in the United States. Political scientists David Broockman and Douglas Ahler have shown how many pollsters distort their numbers by labeling as \"moderate\" people whose conflicting political opinions are incoherent with party platforms -- even when some of these opinions are extreme. \\nJust as polarized as the rest of America, swing states\\' Republicans and Democrats are simply more evenly distributed. Public opinion among Republicans in Indiana, which Gallup lists as a leaning Republican state (46% Republican vs. 38% Democratic), is not massively different from public opinion among Republicans in Wisconsin, one of 2020\\'s most critical swing states. \\nSimilarly, public opinion among Democrats in Minnesota, a leaning Democratic state (46% Democratic vs. 38% Republican), is not massively different from public opinion among Democrats in Wisconsin either. Viewed in this way, Wisconsin (43% Republican vs. 43% Democratic) is just equal parts \"Indiana Republicans\" and \"Minnesota Democrats.\"\\nGiven the shortage of moderates, it is reasonable to ask why some political strategists urge parties and politicians to \"moderate\" their views. This is as much in the interest of persuading those rare moderate voters as it is to avoid raising the salience of issues that are likely to mobilize intense opposition from intense partisans.\\nModerate views are less threatening to partisans, even if fewer people fully agree with them. For example, with regard to the racial justice protests over the summer, Joe Biden has avoided other Democrats\\' passionate demands to defund police departments while voicing his support for protesters and advocating for peace. \\nSecond, swing states are not actually composed of a greater share of undecided voters than other states.\\nLast November, The New York Times Upshot and Siena College conducted a survey of voters across six principal swing states -- Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.\\nTwo thirds of voters said that they would \"definitely\" vote for either the Democratic nominee or President Donald Trump, and these voters were about evenly split between the two candidates. Almost 20% said that there was \"not really any chance\" they would ever support an opposing party\\'s candidate, leaving a mere 15% of swing state voters who could support either party. \\nAmong this fraction, though, a number had already chosen a candidate, leaving only 9% of voters across the six states who were truly \"persuadable.\" According to the American National Election Studies, about 10% of voters nationwide are persuadable, down from 18% as recently as 1992. \\nEven though fewer people align with a party these days, \"independents\" have been found to still reliably vote for the same party. According to polling conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2019, more than 80% of independents lean toward and tend to vote for one party or the other.\\nWhile many will point to these trends as evidence of hardening partisan loyalties amid America\\'s profound polarization, it is also a product of candidates\\' increasing exposure. By the time presidential elections take place, social media and 24-hour news cycles ensure that nearly every detail of candidates\\' lives have been meticulously chronicled. \\nThere is little more information one could need to make a decision. It\\'s therefore not surprising that many undecided voters are also characterized by lower levels of political knowledge or having little free time to mull politics.\\nWhile campaigns will invest in broadcast and digital advertising in the weeks before elections to appeal to the rare undecided voters, many of them focus just as much on mobilization through outrage, fearmongering and identity politics -- anything to motivate those already inclined to vote for their candidate. \\nIn July, Trump said that Democrats want to \"destroy our suburbs,\" warning that his opponents\\' policies would lead to rising crime and lower home values -- baseless claims invoking the racially charged views that spurred suburban \"White flight\" in the 1960s.\\nFor his part, Biden\\'s campaign has run television ads in regions with older populations stating that Trump\\'s plans will \"deplete Social Security within three years,\" a claim that was refuted by The Washington Post. With so few undecided voters in swing states, all campaigns focus heavily on voter mobilization.\\nThird, because swing states have more or less standard shares of moderate and undecided voters, they are not disconnected from larger American demographic and electoral trends; they are subject to the pervasive political dynamics of the moment.\\nAs demographic and attitudinal shifts accumulate, some swing states become more partisan and some partisan states become unpredictable. As late as the 1990s, the Democratic Party retained a strong unionist base and skepticism about global trade and free markets — views that appealed to White working-class populations across much of the Rust Belt. During that period, states like Iowa, Missouri, Ohio and West Virginia were swing states. Bill Clinton won all four in 1992 and 1996.\\nToday, Democrats have embraced globalization and immigration -- and emphasized racial justice. In 2016, Trump won Iowa, Missouri, Ohio and West Virginia and is expected to win most, if not all, of them again in 2020. Instead, diversifying and urbanizing states like Virginia, Colorado, Nevada, North Carolina and Arizona -- once reliably red -- may all be blue this year.\\nCampaigns\\' focus on swing states has historically raised the profile of certain region-specific issues like fracking (Ohio and Pennsylvania), auto manufacturing (Michigan and Ohio) or relations with Cuba (Florida). However, as political scientist Daniel Hopkins has found -- thanks largely to 24-hour cable news and social media -- the \"nationalization\" of American politics has allowed presidential candidates to campaign on largely the same issues in Wisconsin as they might in Wyoming, if they ever visited Wyoming.\\nOf course, every election postmortem will continue to focus on swing states and their voters because that\\'s where the action is. In doing so, we also renew the romance that American politics is still about persuasion.\\nThe most recent example was the Rust Belt\\'s White working-class voters in 2016. In the midst of a strong, quasi-peacetime economy, Trump was able to shift attention to divisive immigration and identity politics to make a nostalgic, populist appeal that mobilized a number of White working-class voters, who had long sat out of elections, felt increasingly ignored by Democrats or felt threatened by Hillary Clinton and her vision for a more global, cosmopolitan American future.\\nSome Democrats have wondered whether they can win these voters back. But many have advocated for the party to turn its attention to persuading suburban women and the elderly -- and mobilizing their established constituents. \\nWhatever voters they target, both Democrats and Republicans will focus on issue salience, voter mobilization and leveraging demographic shifts. So, the real questions we should ask are:\\n1. Will Trump be able to shift attention away from his administration\\'s botched response to the pandemic? \\n2. Are Republicans as motivated to reelect Trump as Democrats are to defeat him?\\n3. What are the overarching demographic trends that may produce new Democratic or Republican voters? \\nOnce we know the answers, the mysterious swing state becomes much more familiar. They are the story of America on a smaller scale.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)The apparent inevitable ascent to Congress of a Georgia Republican who has promoted the outlandish conspiracy theories of QAnon could be a bellwether for American politics, in which extreme views creep increasingly into the mainstream, experts on extremism told CNN.\\nMarjorie Taylor Greene -- who, in addition to promoting QAnon theories, has also suggested that President Barack Obama is Muslim, called Jewish billionaire and liberal philanthropist George Soros a Nazi, and questioned whether a plane really crashed into the Pentagon on 9/11 -- beat neurosurgeon John Cowan in a primary runoff on August 11. \\nA month later, her longshot Democratic challenger, Kevin Van Ausdal, dropped out of the race in the Republican stronghold, citing personal and family reasons, all but clinching Greene\\'s victory for the 14th district congressional seat in northwest Georgia.\\nQAnon adherents believe in a baseless conspiracy theory that there is a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles who have infiltrated the highest reaches of American government and are working hand-in-hand with other elites in business and Hollywood. They believe President Donald Trump is secretly fighting to destroy this cabal and that messages are being delivered to them in code by an anonymous central character called Q. \\nBefore she was a public figure, Greene posted a half-hour video online of herself telling followers about the QAnon conspiracy theory -- saying, for instance, that \"according to him (Q), many in our government are actually worshipping Satan.\" \\nShe did appear to step back from the comments in a Fox News interview posted August 14. While the piece characterized her as not talking about Q after she \"started finding misinformation,\" she has not herself, when asked multiple times since then, publicly disavowed the conspiracy theory, which the FBI has listed as a possible domestic terrorism threat. \\nBrian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said he believes Greene\\'s success may mark the beginning of a larger trend in American politics. \\n\"She is a bellwether,\" he told CNN.\\n\"While most people who run under the QAnon banner will be rightly laughed out of the voting booth, the fact of the matter is that a movement this broad, with this many followers, is bound to elect QAnon participants,\" Levin added.  \"They are growing, they are engaged, and unlike other fringe movements, they are fielding candidates, at all levels from local to national races.\"\\nQAnon supporters emerging in political races\\nSeveral candidates have publicly expressed, in varying degrees, support for QAnon. Among them are Republican Lauren Witzke, who last week bested the party\\'s endorsed candidate for the Senate seat in Delaware held by Democrat Chris Coons. Witzke, who ran on a platform of ending immigration for 10 years, has been photographed wearing a QAnon t-shirt, though she, too, has sought to distance herself from her past comments. \\nAnother primary winner, Jo Rae Perkins of Oregon, vanquished three other candidates in the Republican contest and will face off with incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who has held the office since 2009 in the blue state.\\nIn a recent interview with CNN, Perkins chided a reporter for wearing a mask and said she believes the fatality numbers for Covid-19 have been \"doctored.\" Perkins also discussed QAnon -- which is often referred to as simply Q -- calling it \"a resource for information.\" \\n\"I can read all these articles,\" she said. \"It\\'s kind of like a clearing house. And that\\'s what I really like about Q. That\\'s one thing that I like, the other thing is that there are questions in the Socratic method.\" \\nAt a Second Amendment rally Saturday in Catoosa County, Georgia, CNN asked Greene about her views, but she declined comment. Her husband told CNN, \"have you seen the Fox News interview?\" \\nIn that interview, Greene denied that she is the \"QAnon candidate,\" saying, \"never once during my campaign did I ever speak about QAnon,\" adding that she has run on a \"save America, stop socialism\" platform of supporting President Donald Trump, securing the border by \"building a wall,\" opposing abortion and defending the Second Amendment.\\nRegardless of her current views on QAnon, many groups in the American militia movement support Greene and other candidates who espouse similar views, said Freddy Cruz, a research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center.\\n\"I worry about what will happen, once she is placed in a position when she has a lot more authority,\" Cruz told CNN. \"In the long run (her political success) adds legitimacy to these kinds of ideas, which are incredibly dangerous.\"  \\nCynthia Miller-Idriss, a sociology professor and education at American University, said elected officials should use their elevated platforms to de-escalate conspiracy theories -- not the reverse. \\n\"It is always shocking when we see elected officials either promoting or failing to condemn conspiracy theories, because we rely on those people as the sources of our information about what\\'s true and not true,\" she said.\\nRepublicans warming up to Greene\\nOnce publicly wary, the GOP establishment seems to be warming up to Greene.\\nRep. Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, said in mid-June that Greene had made \"disgusting\" comments regarding Black people, Soros and Muslims. But he told CNN last week that he wants to sit down with Greene and talk about her goals, noting repeatedly he\\'s been told she\\'s \"very strongly\" against abortion.\\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told CNN that she \"denounced QAnon,\" referring to the Fox News piece. Rep. Liz Cheney, a member of the House GOP leadership, also said she was satisfied with Greene\\'s comments on Fox News. \\nSome, like Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican, remain skeptical.\\n\"QAnon is a dangerous thing,\" Kinzinger said in a recent CNN interview. \"It undermines a whole belief in representative democracy.\"\\nAlthough Greene\\'s rise was unexpected, it isn\\'t considered a huge upset, as she hadn\\'t faced an entrenched incumbent. \\nShe initially announced her candidacy against Lucy McBath, a Democrat in the sixth congressional district of Georgia -- which includes the northern suburbs of Atlanta -- who ousted Republican Karen Handel in an upset victory in 2018. \\nGreene\\'s plans changed in late 2019, when Rep. Tom Graves, the 10-year Republican incumbent, announced that he would not seek reelection. Greene, 46, dropped out of the sixth district and announced her candidacy for the 14th district, where she moved in January. \\nGreene beat eight candidates in the June 9 primary, but faced Cowan in the August 11 runoff because neither had garnered at least 50% of the vote. Of the nine Republican candidates, she was the only woman. \\nPrior to her foray into politics, Greene -- a mother of three who purchased her parents\\' construction company, Taylor Commercial, which she now owns with her husband, Perry Greene -- had cultivated a following on social media platforms by promoting extreme views.\\nOn October 5, 2017 -- four days after a mass shooter killed 58 people at a country music festival in Las Vegas -- Greene posted a video on Facebook openly wondering whether it was part of a larger plot aiming to curb gun rights, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\\n\"Is that why the country music festival was targeted -- because those would be the people that we would relate to?\" she asked in the video, the paper reported. \"I don\\'t believe Stephen Paddock was a lone wolf.\"\\nShe later said she was satisfied with investigations by local and federal authorities that concluded that he was, the AJC reported.\\nIn 2018, she hinted at a conspiracy theory often promoted by 9/11 truthers: \"It\\'s odd there\\'s never any evidence shown for a plane in the Pentagon.\" \\nShe has also appeared in a video talking about \"an Islamic invasion into our government offices,\" and has stated that, if she were Black, she would feel \"proud\" to see Confederate statues, because \"I\\'d say, \\'Look how far I have come in this country,\" according to Politico. \\nGreene also initiated a petition to impeach House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for treason. In February 2019, she posted a livestream video on Facebook of herself delivering it to Pelosi\\'s office. It attracted 67,000 likes and other Facebook interactions; by December the petition had amassed nearly 300,000 signatures. \\nAt the rally in Catoosa County rally, Greene\\'s speech didn\\'t address QAnon, but it touched on many of the polarizing themes that have made her controversial: Islam, guns, prayer in schools, \"fake news.\" She referred to Antifa as communists and Black Lives Matter as a \"radical Marxist\" group. Islamic nations, she said, \"throw homosexuals off of buildings.\" \\n\"We will not tolerate rioting, burning and looting of our cities,\" she said. \"We will not allow the government to remove God out of our schools, our pledge and our lives.\" \\nGreene said she refuses to allow the country to be \"pulled down into the depths of socialism.\"\\n\"The Democrat\\'s platform is socialism,\" she said. \"Their policies and their agendas are socialism from every single angle of the Green New Deal to Medicare for all.\"\\nShe lamented how some find her social-media posts offensive, such as one removed by Facebook earlier this month depicting Greene holding a gun next to a separate montage of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other members of the so-called \"Squad.\" \\n\"But they\\'re not offended by the cries by the radical leftists to go out and riot and loot and burn in the street,\" she said. \"I\\'m going to tell you something -- when I get to Congress, I will be fighting for every single person\\'s freedom of speech, because conservatives aren\\'t going to be canceled.\"\\nCNN\\'s Nelli Black contributed to this report.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)Former President Barack Obama urged voters to focus on down-ballot races in new remarks published Thursday, arguing that while the presidential race gets the most attention, it is down-ballot races that could have the greatest impact on politically-motivated gerrymandering.\\nThe video represents the latest attempt by top Democrats to focus attention on down-ballot races, like those for state legislatures across the country. The party hopes that they can take control of a handful of state legislatures in November, wins that could be key because the state bodies elected in 2020 will play major roles in redrawing the congressional and legislative maps in 2021.\\n\"You\\'ve heard a lot about the presidential race, maybe too much,\" Obama says in a video for NowThis News, \"but there is a lot more that will be on the ballot this fall.\"\\nObama adds: \"In this election, the state leaders we elect will help redraw electoral districts all across the country.\"\\nObama is not new to the fight over redistricting and has focused a portion of his post-presidency work on the issue, including by folding his Organizing for Action group into the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a group run by his former attorney general, Eric Holder, that looks to link Democratic issues with the need to take on gerrymandering.\\n\"President Obama has said this is an all hands on deck moment, and one of the main drivers is redistricting that will happen based on November\\'s results,\" Eric Schultz, an Obama adviser, said. \"Now more than ever, we need to elect Democrats up and down the ballot. The Presidential campaign generally gets most of the attention, but President Obama believes these other races are mission-critical.\"\\nThe former president says in the video that he doesn\\'t think people \"completely appreciate how much gerrymandering affects the outcome\" of elections. The video then notes how Republicans swept into control in key states during the 2010 elections, allowing them to redraw maps in places like Georgia, Louisiana, Texas and Ohio.\\nObama argues that many priorities of his presidency, including immigration reform and gun control measures, were thwarted, in part, because of gerrymandered districts electing Republicans to Congress.\\n\"Those maps will stand for 10 years, that could mean a decade of fairly drawn districts where folks have an equal voice in their government, or it could mean a decade of unfair partisan gerrymandering,\" Obama says in the video.\\nThe video was made with NowThis News, a progressive mobile news outlet.\\nDemocrats, emboldened by considerable excitement among their party\\'s key voters, hope they can flip at least one legislative body in Texas, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona and Minnesota. And the party hopes it can make substantial inroads in states like Ohio, Wisconsin, Kansas, Georgia and Florida.\\nGroups like the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and Forward Majority, a super PAC that aims to pour millions into key state legislative races, have been leading the fight to focus Democratic attention to these races.\\nForward Majority announced earlier this month that they would direct $15 million into state legislative races in Texas, Florida, North Carolina and Arizona, so-called Sun Belt states where Democrats believe President Donald Trump could lead voters to reject Republicans in November.\\n\"Without having a seat at the table next year, we will likely see an unprecedented level of gerrymandering,\" said Forward Majority co-founder Vicky Hausman, who argued that these four states \"represent the most powerful points of leverage in our democracy.\"\\nThe is partly a newfound focus for Democrats on down-ballot races like state legislatures. Republicans spent millions to control the legislative bodies over the last decades, leading Democrats to lose control of several state legislatures during Obama\\'s presidency.\\nBut Democratic groups have been making the case, like Obama does in the video, that these local officials wield notable power on everything from how a state responds to something like the coronavirus pandemic to how they deal with issues of police brutality.\\n\"This year, educate yourself on the candidates at every level on your ballot,\" Obama says. \"They can make a profound impact on your community and our country.\"\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Hong Kong (CNN)When 12 Hong Kongers boarded a speedboat in the tiny fishing village of Po Toi O on August 23, they didn\\'t realize they were headed for a world of trouble. \\nBut high in the sky above them, someone may have been aware of the danger they faced. \\nAlmost all the 12 were on bail or facing charges related to last year\\'s anti-government unrest, and were hoping to follow other fugitives who had fled to the self-governing island of Taiwan, about 700 kilometers (440 miles) away. \\nA non-stop sea crossing in an open motorboat of the sort the 12 were using would usually take about 14 hours, dangerous and exhausting, with a severe risk of capsizing. But soon after the 12 crossed the maritime border between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, their boat was stopped by a coast guard vessel. \\nThey have been detained in China ever since, denounced as \"separatists\" by Beijing and charged with a number of offenses, including illegally crossing a border and smuggling, with the threat of potentially more serious national security charges hanging over them. Back in Hong Kong, their families have desperately lobbied for their return, saying the 12 have been denied access to lawyers and abused while in Chinese custody. \\nPolice in Shenzhen, across the China border from Hong Kong, said the \"public security authorities will protect the legitimate rights of the suspects in accordance with the law.\"\\nSpeaking Tuesday, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the fugitives had \"chosen to flee, and in the course of fleeing, they entered another jurisdiction and have committed a crime of illegally entering another place.\" \\n\"They have to face the legal consequences in that jurisdiction,\" Lam added. \"It is as simple and straightforward as that.\"\\nShe refuted any suggestion that the Hong Kong government was aware of or involved in the case prior to the 12 being arrested. \\nBut according to open-source flight data, first reported by Hong Kong newspaper Apple Daily, a Government Flying Services (GFS) aircraft was deployed to eastern Hong Kong, above Po Toi O, at about 4 a.m. on August 23, and stayed in the area for more than four hours. \\nThe movement of the plane -- as recorded by FlightAware, an aircraft tracking service -- closely matches a timeline of the fugitives\\' journey released by the Hong Kong government. \\nThe GFS plane circled the Po Toi O area until 7:30 a.m., when it started flying southeast, the direction the speedboat took to open waters. The Chinese Coast Guard stopped the boat at 9 a.m., less than an hour after the aircraft began making its way back to base. \\nAccording to information provided by GFS, the aircraft involved -- a Bombardier Challenger 605 -- is equipped for search and rescue, airborne surveillance and aerial photography. \\nPublicly available flight data for the particular plane, B-LVB, shows the August 23 trip was out of the ordinary: it did not fly before 7:30 a.m. any other day between August 18 and October 7, nor did it make any other flights of over three hours during this period. \\nOn Thursday, Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong shared a partial flight plan he said had been leaked by a whistleblower within the flying service. The purported log, which CNN has been unable to independently verify, shows an operation labelled \"P-OPS,\" which Wong said stood for \"police operation,\" was ongoing for the period tracked by FlightAware. \\nA spokeswoman for Hong Kong\\'s Security Bureau -- which oversees police, immigration enforcement, and the flying service -- said that \"in accordance with the established practice, aircraft deployment and navigation details involved in flight missions will not be disclosed.\"\\n\"The Hong Kong Police have time and again reiterated that the 12 Hong Kong suspects were arrested by the Mainland authorities for the offense of crossing the boundary illegally,\" she added. \"The operation has nothing to do with the Hong Kong Police.\"\\nThe suggestion that the government or police may have been aware the 12 fugitives, one of whom was facing charges under the city\\'s national security law, planned to flee Hong Kong, and let them go -- exposing them to greater penalties in China -- has caused widespread outrage in the city. \\n\"I\\'m shocked and appalled as the Hong Kong Government evidently colluded with Chinese authorities to put activists in greater danger, on matters clearly within its jurisdiction,\" Wong said in a statement. \\nIn a press release Thursday, a group representing the fugitives\\' families accused the government of a \"conspiracy\" to hand over their loved ones to China, and called for their immediate release. \\nA small protest was held outside the flying service headquarters later Thursday, but it was soon broken up by police, who accused demonstrators of breaking coronavirus public gathering restrictions. \\nHong Kong has its own judicial system, under the \"one country, two systems\" principle that was intended to safeguard the city\\'s limited autonomy until 2047, with legal and human rights protections not enjoyed on the mainland.\\nFear of being exposed to China\\'s judicial system, where the conviction rate is more than 90% and political prosecutions are common, sparked protests against an extradition bill last year which transformed into months of anti-government unrest. \\nThis year, as protests began to pick up again following a coronavirus-forced break, the Chinese government imposed the national security law on Hong Kong, criminalizing sedition, secession and subversion. \\nThe law, which the government says is necessary to restore order, has caused several prominent activists to flee overseas. \\nCNN\\'s Rebecca Wright, Ivan Watson and Isaac Yee contributed reporting.\\n'},\n",

Gutiérrez represented the 4th Congressional District of Illinois for more than 25 years and has been a leading advocate for immigration reform, health care and climate action. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion articles on CNN. \\n (CNN)Three years after Hurricane Maria tore through Puerto Rico, hardship on the US territory is still palpable. Thousands of Puerto Ricans still live under blue tarps after losing their homes in the storm. Hundreds of schools shut down after the destruction of September 20, 2017. Death tolls in the storm\\'s wake range from 3,000 to as many as 4,645 -- the exact tally is likely to remain a mystery. And the island\\'s crippled economy hasn\\'t recovered.\\nBut Friday, after years of inaction and omission, and only 45 days before the election, President Donald Trump, who once boasted \"I\\'m the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico,\" decided it was time to send the island $13 billion in disaster aid. Before the announcement, the Trump administration had been holding back billions in funds approved by Congress for disaster relief in Puerto Rico.\\nSuch a cynical move could only lead us to ask: Why now? \\nVoters in Florida, a key battleground state, are crucial for the presidential election. It\\'s no coincidence that the Sunshine State is home to thousands of Puerto Ricans who fled the island after Maria. With the many others that were there before the tragedy, Puerto Ricans now make up almost a third of the state\\'s eligible Hispanic voters, a similar share to that of Cubans, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of US Census Bureau data.\\nThree years have passed and the island, which was hit by a string of devastating earthquakes earlier this year and currently faces a spike in coronavirus cases, remains markedly resilient.\\nThe consequences of deadly hurricanes, extreme weather and earthquakes often begin to fade from the news and conversation weeks after they hit. The world moves on. But those living in Puerto Rico cannot move on. Because the cracked and unstable bridges and roads, traffic disruptions, abandoned homes and a forever-changed population are daily reminders that our home is not yet whole.\\nI was still serving in Congress when the hurricane hit Puerto Rico. The first few weeks were overwhelming. I wanted to get to the island as soon as I could, but President Trump restricted access to planes for members of Congress. I was finally able to get a commercial flight to the island nine days after the storm.\\nWhile Trump was suggesting that Puerto Ricans only wait for government assistance with their hands crossed, I personally saw how we Boricuas in the mainland were the first to get to the island with hands on deck ready to work.\\nI visited Puerto Rico 12 times in the first three months of the tragedy\\'s aftermath and saw how terrible and ineffective the federal government\\'s response was.\\nPuerto Rico has endured tragedy and loss. The need is real. Only 200 long-term recovery projects have been funded in Puerto Rico, out of more than 9,000 requests, according to FEMA\\'s own count. \\nBy the end of 2018, Hurricane Maria had displaced more than 130,000 Puerto Ricans, according to data from the US Census Bureau. The almost 4% drop in the population changed the island\\'s demographics and put a mental and emotional strain on families who\\'ve been separated out of economic and health necessity.\\nThis is all to say: We cannot look away from Puerto Rico. Our fellow Americans living here are still struggling with a storm three years after it made landfall. We still need robust investment in infrastructure, health, education to rebuild, and regrow.\\nPaying attention to the real needs in Puerto Rico and not only to what is solely politically convenient is now more critical than ever as we see an increased risk from the threat of more dangerous and frequent storms.\\nThe 2020 hurricane season was projected to be \"extremely active,\" and it has lived up to that projection. Puerto Rico has already been in the path of two major storms. Both Hurricane Isaias and Tropical Storm Laura caused flooding and shortages in power and running water on the island. \\nThis is not an accident. It is not bad luck. This is the new normal under climate change. Global warming is fueling stronger and more destructive hurricanes. \\nOne day, one year, three years: The reality is still the same. The island we love, the island I profoundly love, is in constant danger at the mercy of a climate crisis that will define our generation and the ones to come. This is why, on the third anniversary, we need to remind everyone that for Puerto Rico, Hurricane Maria feels like it was yesterday and could well be our tomorrow. And, most importantly, that Puerto Rico\\'s pain shouldn\\'t be used as a political token.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': \"This article was originally published in the International Monetary Fund's blog. Saad Quayyum is an economist at the International Monetary Fund. Roland Kangni Kpodar is deputy unit chief in the strategy, policy and review department at the International Monetary Fund and senior fellow at the Foundation for Studies and Research on International Development (FERDI). The opinions expressed in this commentary are their own.  \\nJust as Covid-19 has disproportionately impacted some communities more than others, globally, the virus has had an oversized negative impact on migrant workers. \\nPerhaps surprisingly, despite the bleak experience for foreign overseas workers during the pandemic, the effect on remittances — the flow of money they send back home — has, in many cases, proven resilient. But that trend may yet be upended. \\nThe predicament of migrant workers over the last few months has highlighted the pressing need — now greater than ever — to support them and their families back home. \\nIn the wake of the pandemic, many overseas foreign workers lost their jobs, and reports were widespread of newly laid-off foreign employees stranded in host countries without the means to return home. \\nMigrants, many of whom are undocumented, often face a heavier burden than a local worker once they lose their job. They often lack access to social safety nets or stimulus checks, which provide a cushion to their local counterparts. This is especially the case for the undocumented or those on temporary work visas \\nAt the same time, many migrant workers have limited or no access to health care. Crowded living quarters, together with poor working conditions, put them at higher risk of contracting the virus. \\nThey may also live in fear of deportation as several countries have tightened immigration rules in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. \\nOutlook for remittances \\nIt's unsurprising then that remittances were expected to take a hit from the pandemic as countries that employ large numbers of foreign workers moved into recession. In addition, the hundreds of thousands of migrant workers employed in major oil-producing countries also suffered repercussions from the drop in oil prices, which weighed down the outlook of Gulf Cooperation Council countries and Russia. \\nThe remittances sent back by migrants are a crucial source of external financing. In 57 countries, it exceeded 5% of GDP last year. The money went mostly to low-income households.  \\nAgainst the background of the current health crisis, the need for that income is acute. \\nBack in April, the World Bank estimated that remittances would fall by 20% in low and middle-income countries.\\nDespite the coronavirus and its likely impact on remittances, the picture is not unconditionally bleak. Remittances often hold up in response to adverse shocks in recipient countries. This possibly explains why they were surprisingly resilient in many countries in the first half of the year. \\nWhile there is a great deal of diversity, remittances largely fell from March, then started to stabilize in May before picking up. This pattern was broadly in line with the stringency of virus containment policies in advanced countries where strict measures were put in place in March and slowly relaxed starting in May. \\nThe bounce back in remittances could be driven by a greater need to send money back to families as the remittance-receiving countries now struggle with the pandemic and collapse in external demand.\\nBut, if migrants are dipping into their meager savings to support families back home, this may not be sustainable over time, especially if the recession in host economies becomes protracted. A second outbreak of the coronavirus in the latter part of the year in host economies, for example, could jeopardize remittance flows further.  \\nNow more than ever, adequate and timely policy responses from both remittance-sending and remittance-receiving countries are critical to help migrant workers. Overseas workers often fill essential roles — in health care, agriculture, food production and processing — and often risk their lives to perform these jobs. \\nSolutions\\nHost countries could ensure all migrants have access to health care, and basic goods and services. There have been some positive steps in this area: All migrants and asylum-seekers were temporarily granted citizenship rights in Portugal. Italy announced plans for temporary work permits for more than half a million undocumented migrants deemed essential for harvesting crops and caring for the elderly. The State of California has contributed $75 million to a $125 million fund to provide $500 to support each undocumented worker. Back home, authorities in countries that send workers overseas could step up support to vulnerable households, especially in those countries where the drop in remittances has been more severe. As remittances dry up, well-targeted cash transfers and food aid can be especially helpful to protect poor households, and those at risk of falling back into poverty. Returning migrants may need training to be reabsorbed in the labor market. Access to credit can help them start a business where opportunities in the formal labor market is limited. Technology could also be leveraged to the benefit of migrant workers and their families. For example, digital technology and mobile payment systems could be used to facilitate and lower the cost of sending and receiving remittances. The average cost of sending remittances was about 7% in the first quarter of 2020. Reducing this cost now would return a significant amount of money to the poor. Governments could modify regulations to facilitate flows while minimizing risks of inappropriate use. Relaxing caps on how much can be transferred digitally (through mobile phones for example) can be helpful. Providing tax incentives to money transfer service providers to offset reduction in fees, as Pakistan did during the Global Financial Crisis, can be a smart move. Schemes like the 2% cash back for remitters instituted by Bangladesh can further support remittance flow. Increasing market competition among the remittance service providers can also drive down the cost. \\n\\n\"},\n",

Santorum twice ran for president of the United States and is now a CNN senior political commentator. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\\n (CNN)The much anticipated first 2020 presidential debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden will undoubtedly captivate the nation. Political pundits, activists, and voters should not underestimate Biden's debate acumen. As the Democratic presidential nominee's Senate colleague for a dozen years, and as someone who has participated in Republican presidential primary debates, I know firsthand that he possesses performance skills necessary to succeed in Tuesday's debate. \\nRecently, observers on all sides of the political spectrum have questioned Biden's ability to display a sound debate performance, but I expect him to bring his 'A' game.\\nLet us not forget, Biden is a career politician who has spent more than four decades in Washington. That would give anyone a depth of knowledge of every issue and a comfort that comes from debating them on the Senate floor for more than 35 years. We also witnessed him hold his own in the vice-presidential debates against former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, and most recently in some of the primary debates, he outmaneuvered his Democratic opponents -- many of whom are well-respected debaters in their own rights. \\nAs someone who worked alongside Biden in the United States Senate, almost always on opposing sides of our nation's most critical issues, I can affirm that he would not have risen into Democratic leadership if he did not hold the skills necessary to succeed on Tuesday night's stage. \\nTrump must be prepared to take the fight to Biden. Hillary Clinton was a tough challenger in 2016, but Biden has many more years of substantive national debate experience than her. \\nMost political pundits dismissed Trump heading into the 2016 debates, yet he came out swinging and, from my vantage point, caught Clinton off guard in each one. It is imperative that he brings the same intensity and focus on Biden's deplorable record on policies ranging from taxes to trade and his extreme agenda in order to win Tuesday night. \\nBeyond his bravado, Trump shepherded in an incredibly strong economy -- one which hit the lowest unemployment rate in a half-century in 2019, historically low unemployment for African Americans and Hispanics, and a soaring stock market. I am confident that he will do it again during a second term.  \\nAnd for many conservatives like myself, one of his most impressive accomplishments has been nominating more than 200 constitutionalists to the federal bench, with a third Supreme Court justice nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, who could be confirmed soon. \\nTrump needs to put this record front and center when he squares off with Biden. And then he must contrast those accomplishments with Biden's agenda of raising taxes, what even former Obama defense secretary Robert Gates has called his many questionable foreign policy decisions, his advocacy for damaging trade deals like NAFTA, which cost nearly 880,000 jobs in its first decade per the Economic Policy Institute, and his support for liberal immigration policies that reward illegal behavior with a glide path to citizenship and -- as studies have shown -- drive down wages for far too many American workers. \\nThe first presidential debate will be a knock-down, drag-out fight between the two candidates. After more than a week of virtually no campaign appearances so he could prepare for this debate, no one should doubt Biden's ability to rise to the occasion. \\nIt is my hope that Trump will remind American voters why he ran for president in the first place -- to fight for the men and women of this nation, the blue-collar families that have been forgotten time and time again by our national policymakers. If he does, he can defeat Biden on Tuesday and reset the presidential race heading down the home stretch.\\n\\n\"},\n",

View more opinion on CNN.\\n (CNN)President Donald Trump is used to taking questions from celebrity anchors at Fox News, who lob softballs greased with praise. His appearance in a town hall Tuesday night, held by ABC News, featuring questions from undecided voters in Pennsylvania, was an altogether different experience. Faced with demands for answers, Trump resorted to his standard lies about what he has done and what his rival, Democratic candidate Joe Biden, would do as president.\\n \\n \\nThe most obvious conclusion one can reach watching Trump lie about his own record and about what Biden proposes, is that Trump simply does not believe he has a superior plan to offer voters. He looked like a fast-talking salesman hawking an inferior product.\\nConsider, for example, his answer when Ellesia Blaque, who was born with a serious illness, and asked about his efforts to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, which guarantees coverage for people with preexisting conditions. \\n \\nTrump responded with a fictional tale about Biden\\'s health care plans, so detached from reality that ABC\\'s George Stephanopoulos had to stop him by asserting a barrage of facts to which Trump responded with the only ammunition he could find: even more lies. The President claimed that Biden and the Democrats will get rid of preexisting condition coverage, while he will offer a plan to protect it. \\n \\nIf one could create reality by repeating a lie, a Trump health care plan that is better than Obamacare -- any Trump health care plan -- would have materialized long ago. Trump has been claiming he has one for at least four years. Again, on Tuesday he repeated this promise. In reality, the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to get rid of Obamacare and has offered nothing in its place. It is the Democrats who created a plan that made health care accessible for most, if not all Americans. Trump lied about Biden imposing, \"socialized medicine.\" Biden has run since the primaries in open opposition to Medicare for All.  \\n \\nThe President claimed Biden will bring an economic depression, \"the likes of which we have never seen in this country,\" even though it is under Trump\\'s administration that the country is in the worst downturn since the Great Depression. He reiterated his claim that the economy will surge in a \"super V\" shape recovery. Many economists are skeptical of that rosy projection.  Trump also falsely claimed Biden \"wants to raise everybody\\'s taxes.\" Biden has said he will raise taxes on people earning $400,000 a year or more.\\n \\n \\nTrump lied, equivocated and misled about the pandemic, claiming against all evidence that \"We\\'re rounding the corner,\" and in spite of expert predictions that more than 410,000 Americans will have died of Covid-19 by the end of this year. He said the virus will go away without a vaccine, but faster with one. In a curious moment, he explained that the virus would disappear as \"you\\'ll develop -- you\\'ll develop herd -- like a herd mentality.\" Perhaps he was thinking about herd immunity, but it\\'s unclear. \\n \\nWhen asked about why he downplayed the coronavirus, he claimed that he \"up-played it,\" even though his monthslong denial is thoroughly documented. He again congratulated himself, claiming he did a great job handling the pandemic. Oddly, he expounded about the virus to a woman who said her mother died of cancer and was asking about his plans to expand immigration.\\n \\nWhen asked about his refusal to issue a nationwide mask order, he harmfully repeated that \"there are a lot of people think that masks are not good.\" And then, making a bizarre statement about Democrats, he said:  \"They said at the Democrat convention they\\'re going to do a national mandate, they never did it.\"\\n \\nTo lies and misrepresentations, Trump added a heavy dose of denial. Smacked with a series of questions about racism and allegations of excessive use of force by some police, particularly against African Americans, Trump appeared to be aiming not to gain the support of the people asking the questions, but at keeping the backing of his already-enlisted White nationalist fans.\\n \\nHe rejected any claim that the country has a problem with racism, and when asked what common-sense police reforms he could support, he offered perhaps the most startling response of the night. Almost all police officers are good, he explained, but they are afraid that if \"they do something slightly wrong ... their life is ruined.\" Trump\\'s proposal amid the attention rightly being given to police killings? Give police more power. \"We have to give the police back that strength that they had a short while ago and that they have in Republican cities,\" he said. \\n \\nThis was not the performance of a candidate who believes he offers better policies than his rival. Instead, it was the work of a salesman who thinks he can outtalk the crowd -- and make them buy something different from what they thought they wanted.   \\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)The Trump administration hasn\\'t announced how many refugees could be admitted to the United States in the upcoming fiscal year, which begins this week, signaling yet another delay and likely leaving thousands of those seeking refuge in limbo again. \\nUnder President Donald Trump the administration has slowly chipped away at the refugee cap, which dictates how many may come to the United States. The US had been already on course during the 2020 fiscal year to admit the lowest level of refugees since 1980 when the coronavirus pandemic hit and led to a pause in arrivals until late July. \\nNow, just days before the start of the next fiscal year, the administration has stayed mum on what the next cap might be -- a move reminiscent of last year, when an announcement was made shortly before the fiscal year began on Oct. 1 and the final sign-off by the President came in November. \\nWithout a presidential determination, as it\\'s known, refugees cannot be resettled in the US, with some exceptions. \\n\"This administration has never administered this program in good faith,\" said Danielle Grigsby, director of policy and practice at Refugee Council USA. \"And yet again, we have another fiscal year coming to a close and we\\'ve not come anywhere near hitting any of the regional ceilings, the ceiling goals. It seems par for the course again.\"\\nOnly a little more than 9,000 refugees had been admitted to the US as of August 31, according to the Refugee Processing Center. That\\'s half of the refugee ceiling -- 18,000 -- set late last year. \\nEach year, the administration sets a cap for how many refugees may be admitted to the US. Historically, the number of admissions has fluctuated according to world events, though it\\'s generally been high. From fiscal years 1990 to 1995, for example, many refugees arriving in the US were from the former Soviet Union, according to the Pew Research Center.\\nIn the last few years of the Obama presidency, the administration moved toward increasingly high caps, up to 110,000 in fiscal year 2017 amid the Syrian crisis. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee, has pledged to restore high levels of refugee admissions if elected, setting an annual target of 125,000. \\nWhen asked about the upcoming refugee ceiling, a State Department spokesperson declined to comment on internal deliberations. \\n\"The overall refugee admissions ceiling and allocations are the President\\'s decision, following appropriate consultations with Congress, based on the advice of relevant agencies,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"We do not comment on the internal discussions or the timeline related to its development.\"\\nThe refugee cap is discussed among several departments and agencies, and eventually approved by the President. Consultation with Congress over the cap is also required by law. \\nDemocratic leaders on the House and Senate judiciary committees sent a letter to the Trump administration in early September, urging officials to \"engage in meaningful consultations with Congress\" before setting the next fiscal year refugee cap. \\n\"We are in the midst of the worst refugee crisis in history,\" reads the letter from Sens. Richard Durbin of Illinois and Dianne Feinstein of California, along with Reps. Jerrold Nadler of New York and Zoe Lofgren of California, citing in part the pandemic. \\nThere\\'s often a moratorium on arrivals the first few days of October, but last year that moratorium extended into the fall. The same thing could happen this year if a presidential determination is not made soon.\\n\"At the start of every fiscal year, there is a pause in resettlement travel for the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program,\" the State Department spokesperson said, regarding the moratorium. \"Our implementing partners are notified and we coordinate closely with them to resume travel once the Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions is signed for that fiscal year.\"\\nThe persistent delays continue to fuel uncertainty among refugee resettlement organizations. \\n\"It very well could be the last, final blow to the program, as we\\'ve been treading water the last few years,\" said Jen Smyers, director of policy and advocacy for the immigration and refugee program at Church World Service, one of the nine resettlement agencies. \"If there\\'s a whole month without resettlement, that alone is really detrimental to the program.\"\\nCNN\\'s Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report. \\n'},\n",

The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\\n (CNN)The first presidential debate on Tuesday night was a national security catastrophe. And it wasn\\'t only the countless Americans who watched in dismay as President Donald Trump acted more like a child than a competent commander in chief -- the world was watching. Trump\\'s debate disaster not only embarrassed our country, it made each and every one of us less safe.\\nAt a basic level, Trump\\'s debate performance was a metaphor for his presidency -- erratic, unhinged and untruthful. In fact, the only thing that Trump did well during the debate was lie.\\nOur allies and our enemies saw the President mocking not only the debate rules but also our democracy, as he dug his heels in on his refusal to say he will accept the outcome of the 2020 election.\\nWhile allies likely watched in dismay and probably continue to worry about how to fill the void left by a lack of competent US leadership, our enemies have cause to rejoice. Trump\\'s behavior has been a critical contribution to Russia\\'s mission to undermine the US-led world order and what Trump\\'s own White House has described as the Chinese Communist Party\\'s goals of discrediting democracy. The Chinese just have to re-air Trump\\'s debate debacle, and US democracy is discredited.\\nThe President\\'s interruptions, lies and disjointed thoughts don\\'t paint a picture of a sane global leader; they paint a picture of a maniac man who has access to the nuclear codes. After watching that debate, not to mention witnessing the past almost four years of his presidency, the idea that Trump is the man whom Americans elected to lead the nation is a major self-inflicted blow to any fantasy of the United States as a global leader. Rival powers like Russia and China probably cheered throughout those painful 90-plus minutes because Trump is a poster child for their propaganda about democratic decay. \\nBut it wasn\\'t just Trump\\'s attitude Tuesday night that was dangerous -- it was also his rhetoric. \\nAs an American, a security analyst and the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, Trump\\'s rhetoric on White supremacy was one of the most sickening things I have listened to. Not only did he fail to forcefully condemn White supremacy when explicitly pressed by the moderator, but he essentially issued a call to action by telling the Proud Boys, a far-right group that the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) calls misogynistic, Islamophobic, transphobic and anti-immigration, to \"stand back and stand by.\" The Proud Boys took note and reportedly celebrated his words. (After the debate, Trump\\'s son Donald Trump Jr. and his campaign aide Jason Miller said that Trump had misspoken.)\\nThis isn\\'t the first time that Trump has failed to condemn White supremacists. Nor is it the first time that he has fanned the flames when it comes to dangerous domestic threats. FBI Director Christopher Wray recently testified that within the category of domestic terrorism, racially motivated violent extremism -- especially White supremacist threats -- is the \"biggest bucket\" that the FBI works on. Yet, with a perceived endorsement from the President, the Proud Boys could very well accelerate their disgusting, violent activities. To put it plainly, Trump undercut law and order -- and law enforcement -- by potentially raising a domestic terrorism threat with his rhetoric during the presidential debate.\\nBut the Proud Boys likely weren\\'t the only ones proud of POTUS last night -- Russia\\'s Vladimir Putin probably was, too. Trump\\'s inaccurate comments on election integrity sounded like a public service announcement scripted by the Kremlin.\\nWhen pressed on the facts about mail-in voting, Trump lied and spread conspiracy theories, despite the warning from the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency that foreign actors and cyber criminals are doubling down on spreading disinformation about the elections. Wray even specifically said that he worries misinformation could contribute to Americans losing confidence in our elections.\\nTrump was more than a megaphone for such misinformation last night. With all the access he has to US intelligence, not to mention the fact that Russian disinformation efforts are public information, Trump should know that he\\'s helping Putin attack the United States -- but he seems not to care.\\nWhile debates have historically been a key opportunity for Americans to hear from candidates, we can\\'t call this first engagement a debate. It was, flat out, a national security disaster.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)For 122 seconds on Wednesday night, the vice presidential debate was hijacked by an insect interloper. \\nWhat appeared to be a common housefly emerged inside the University of Utah\\'s Kingsbury Hall and, like a weary traveler, rested for more than two minutes on Vice President Mike Pence\\'s neatly parted white hair. \\nBy midmorning Wednesday, a parody Twitter account in its name had amassed more than 100,000 followers -- including, but not limited to, the former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, The New York Times\\' erstwhile chief book critic, some political operatives and one \"crazycookielady\" of Turlock, California.\\nFor one night and early morning, as this dark and doom-y election season slouches toward a fraught conclusion in the midst of a pandemic, they were united in their desire to read tweeted bug puns. The debate itself, discussion of which was quickly blotted out by news about the next one, was mostly memorable for its discussion of the coronavirus and Pence\\'s depiction of alternate and much more appealing history of the Trump administration\\'s response. That followed, in the run-up, a couple days of drama over the Pence camp\\'s reluctance to seat their candidate beside an ornamental, from a scientific perspective, plexiglass barrier.\\nThis was not the first time the theater of politics was interrupted by the absurd. Nor was it a first that the bright light of a debate -- theoretically if not practically designed to address the existential issues of the day -- was overshadowed by something weird or uncanny. Usually, though, it is one of the candidates that sets the tiny fire that crackles on for longer -- so much longer -- than it should. \\nThe now-famous real housefly of Salt Lake City, with its two-plus minutes of screen time, received two-plus more minutes of attention on the debate stage Wednesday than issues like immigration, which was not put up for debate, or the actuarial realities facing the two men atop the debaters\\' tickets, which was the subject of a question that neither candidate answered. One Twitter account created after the moment, meant to be a parody from the fly\\'s point of view, sent out insights from \"Bzz bzzz lol\" to a more pointed analysis of Pence\\'s performance.\\nMeanwhile, the Biden campaign struck fast with the puns and began hawking a \"Truth Over Flies\" fly swatter for $10 on its website. But be warned, \"Orders ship within 14 days\" -- or about 13, on the long end, from the time this episode zips out the window of collective cultural memory.   \\nThe modern era of debate night memes has typically carried some kind of underlying, metaphorical significance. In 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, now the junior senator from Utah, bragged about the \"binders full of women\" he drew from while staffing up his gubernatorial office in Massachusetts. Romney later described the phrasing as \"inelegant,\" but defended his efforts to create a more diverse workplace. \\nThe viral Twitter accounts and Facebook pages, one of which quickly amassed 300,000 followers, that sprung up in the aftermath of his remark have mostly been abandoned. Presently, @bindersofwomen is one of the few that tweets on, but only to a trifling 1,200 or so loyalists. (Or, more likely, about that number of zombie followers who haven\\'t culled their feeds in eight years.)\\nThe binders were real, as it turned out, as the Boston Globe reported in 2017 -- a little less than five years after their star turn. There were two of them, three rings on each, weighing in at 15 pounds and 6 ounces. \\nFor his part, former President Barack Obama might consider himself lucky that the social media of 2020 was still mostly stardust back in 2008. In a debate with Hillary Clinton during that year\\'s salty primary campaign, Clinton was asked by a moderator what she would say to New Hampshire voters about her \"likability issue.\"\\n\"Well, that hurts my feelings,\" Clinton deadpanned. \"But I\\'ll try to go on.\"\\nAfter she described Obama as \"very likable,\" the future president interjected, \"You\\'re likable enough, Hillary.\"\\n\"I appreciate that,\" she replied, smiling, somehow, through it all. The episode raised some eyebrows and made headlines, but didn\\'t trigger the kind of popular backlash it might have even a few years later.\\n Other debate night oddities, missteps and trivia have survived much longer. \\nThe late former President George H.W. Bush\\'s decision to steal a glance at his wristwatch as a voter began to ask how \"the national debt affected\" his life was caught on camera in 1992 and framed as evidence of the incumbent\\'s disconnect with ordinary Americans.\\nAnd then there was Richard Nixon\\'s sweaty, waxen visage, which -- as we\\'re quadrennially reminded -- shaped public opinion around the 1960 campaign, and not in his favor. The juxtaposition with a tanned John F. Kennedy, poised to lead America into a New Frontier, was -- in the popular telling -- a defining moment in that year\\'s election. \\nLesser political talents than Nixon, who lost out to Kennedy by a sliver before winning twice, in 1968 and 1972, have seen what might have been a minor digression or stumble take on a life of its own. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry\\'s 2012 presidential bid never quite recovered from an inconvenient moment of forgetfulness on a Republican primary debate stage. In describing how he\\'d cut down on federal spending, Perry informed voters he would like to ax three big government agencies. \\nThe Departments of Commerce and Education were two of them. The third, though, eluded him. \"Oops,\" he said, surrendering to memory lapse as his rivals looked on. It was the Department of Energy -- the same agency Perry would go on to lead for more than two years as a member of the Trump administration\\'s first round of cabinet chiefs.  \\nNot all self-generated signature debate moments are rejected or regretted by their authors. In 2012, after Obama fumbled his way through a first round with Romney, then-Vice President Joe Biden came out throwing against his opposite number, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan. In a performance The Guardian described as \"high-energy ... part angry bar-room debater, part condescending elder uncle, part comic mime artist,\" Biden dismissed a Ryan remark by declaring, \"\\'With all due respect, that\\'s a bunch of malarkey.\" \\nMalarkey, and his desire to see it gone, has been a theme of this Biden campaign. \\nIn December 2019, the campaign launched an eight-day, \"No Malarkey\" bus tour through Iowa. And yes, there are buttons and magnets emblazoned with the expression on sale to pair with your fly swatter on the Biden 2020 website.\\nBut the most enduring debate night utterance of recent times came from then-candidate Trump during one of his face-offs with Hillary Clinton around this time in 2016. And, appropriately, it was an interruption. As Clinton spoke about taxes and social security, and suggested Trump would try to avoid the former at the expense of the latter, Trump leaned down into his microphone and muttered, \"Such a nasty woman.\"\\nClinton bulled on, but an enduring meme -- one rife with T-shirts and other branded items -- was born.\\n\\n'},\n",

It\\'s a thought ricocheting around the world as we cope with Covid-19, quarantine, wildfires and hurricanes. \\nNow it can. \\nRosh Hashanah, which marks the Jewish New Year, begins Friday, September 18. Even if you\\'re not Jewish, it\\'s a way to immerse yourself in parts of these rituals of renewal. Maybe God knows we all need a little renewal now.\\n\"I\\'m thrilled that it\\'s time for Rosh Hashanah,\" said Stacy Stuart, co-founder of JewBelong, a lighthearted New York-based organization for Jews, non-Jews and anyone who has felt like an outsider at Jewish events. \\n\"It\\'s about how you want to clear your soul for the New Year,\" said Archie Gottesman, who co-founded the organization with Stuart.\\nThey\\'re organizing a virtual event Friday evening called \"Sins, Stars and Shofars!\" a one-hour event with stories, song and readings focused on uplifting people and repairing the rifts and divides facing our world. It features a celebrity lineup, including US Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, CNN political commentator Bakari Sellers, comedian Judy Gold and actress Alysia Reiner, from Netflix\\'s \"Orange Is the New Black.\"\\n\"People have been stressed. They\\'ve been isolated and freaking out,\" said Rabbi Amichai Lau-Lavie, founding spiritual leader of Lab/Shul NYC, an experimental community for sacred Jewish gatherings, which is organizing its own virtual high holiday programs separate from JewBelong.\\nJewBelong sums up 2020\\'s anxieties in its event tagline: \"Kinda feel like God owes us an apology this year?\"\\nBringing in a New Year in September\\nRosh Hashanah, which means \"head of the year\" in Hebrew, is a two-day celebration that marks the beginning of the Jewish High Holy Days each autumn.\\nThe New Year inaugurates 10 days of repentance, also known as Days of Awe. They lead into Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, which this year is on Sunday, September 27. That\\'s followed by Sukkot, of the Feast of Tabernacles, commemorating how God protected the Israelites as they wandered the desert in search of the Promised Land.\\nRosh Hashanah begins Friday at sundown, customarily with the blowing of the shofar, the ram\\'s horn, a sound traditionally meant to wake up people from their slumber, or perhaps in this year\\'s case, quarantine.\\n\"We are trying to find ways to replace the communal feeling (congregants) are missing by not gathering in person,\" said Rabbi Joshua Lesser, who leads Congregation Bet Haverim in Atlanta.\\nHe created a Facebook group called \"Dreaming Up High Holy Days 2020,\" which has gathered more than 2,700 rabbis, cantors and lay people in a conversation about how to adapt Jewish traditions to the present pandemic. That group has become a vibrant ground for creative ideas.\\nOne way Lesser\\'s congregation is specifically adapting is by creating high-holiday boxes for congregants that include holiday candles, apple snacks, honey and notebooks for people to jot down reflections as they mark the high holidays wherever they are.\\nAnd they have created DIY high-holiday guides, which explain how to create a sacred space within the home that includes a makeshift altar and personal pictures or totems of significance.\\n\"I can\\'t imagine I would have thought this way had services been as usual,\" Lesser said.\\nA holiday of reflection\\nTraditionally, Rosh Hashanah is about acknowledging where we might have fallen short in the previous year and how to repair ourselves and the world in the coming year.\\n\"You are invited to be publicly private, to be publicly present and say \\'I\\'m here to work on my personal stuff,\\'\" Lau-Lavie said. \"It\\'s true every year, but it\\'s especially true this year given the pandemic and the political moment.\"\\nDuring the high-holiday season, he has enrolled hundreds in various challenges related to spiritual readings and personal commitments on topics including racial justice and immigration reform.\\n\"These are the questions that you ask in therapy or with a coach or when you sweat your ass off in yoga,\" Lau-Lavie said. \"Who am I? Who do I want to be?\"\\nJewBelong is offering online tools to help guide people through their own personal reflections.\\nWhether or not you\\'re Jewish, he explained, there\\'s value in the spiritual and emotional exercise of honestly contemplating your actions this year, and what you want most out of your life.\\nAn opportunity to apologize\\nMaybe you\\'ve been fighting with someone, neglecting them or been dishonest to others, yourself or to the universe. \\nThe Jewish High Holy Days are a chance to say you\\'re sorry, Stuart explained.\\nJewBelong\\'s tool enables you to write out exactly where you feel you may have missed the mark. Then you have the option to send that in an email, perhaps to yourself or to the person you want to apologize to.\\nOr you can share it on Facebook or Twitter, making your personal expression of sorrow or remorse public for your whole community to see.\\nCast off those sins\\nOne major theme of Rosh Hashanah is the tradition of tashlich in which people symbolically cast off their sins, often by throwing morsels of bread into a flowing body of water.\\n\"Kids remember throwing sins into the river, or they may not remember anything else but they go to do tashlich -- which is casting their sins -- they remember that,\" Stuart said. \"Physical rituals really last.\"\\nIf finding a body of water nearby is too hard, you could just use your bathtub or sink, Gottesman added.\\nOr you can use JewBelong\\'s virtual tool, which allows you to input aspects of your life to improve. Examples might include faults such as jealousy or gossip, or more generally being afraid to try new things or finding fault in your partner\\'s body.\\nThe English word \"sin\" isn\\'t necessarily the best translation of the concept, Lau-Lavie explained. A better way of thinking of it might be to examine where we are hitting the mark in our lives, and where we are falling short of the best version of ourselves.\\nIt includes a prayer from the Rabbi Rachel Barenblat:\\n\"I\\'m ready to let go of my mistakes. Help me release myself from the ways I\\'ve missed the mark, lift my troubles off my shoulders. Help me to know that last year is over, washed away like crumbs in a current. Open my heart to blessing and gratitude. Renew my soul as the dew renews the grasses.\"\\nWhat\\'s your legacy?\\nFinally, the New Year reflection gives us a chance to envision our future. JewBelong created a tombstone tool, asking people to type in what they might like to have written on their tombstone, encapsulating the meaning of their life.\\nIt could be as simple as \"He pet every puppy\" or \"She always took time to listen.\"\\nThen you have a chance to add what you can do right now to start enacting that reality.\\n\"It\\'s about \\'How do you want to be spending your life?\\'\" Stuart said. \"This is not a dress rehearsal.\"\\nAnother way of understanding the spirit of Rosh Hashanah, for believers and nonbelievers, is to think of it as a rigorous self-analysis of your past, present and future.\\nLau-Lavie recommended making a list of habits from your past that are no longer serving you, figuring out what you can do in the present to course-correct and then making a commitment to live better going forward.\\n\"It\\'s an invitation for reflective honesty,\" he said. \"The bottom line is not Jewish. The bottom line is human.\"\\n\\n'},\n",

Or, if he does, who will still carry an enormous clout among his base of voters? How does Biden attempt to appeal to these voters who felt so aggrieved by American politics that they voted for Trump not once but twice?\\nHow does Biden begin to heal racial tensions when some factions on the left and the right, among Whites and Blacks, find him to be a problematic arbiter of race relations? \\nHow does he pass any of his legislative promises if Congress remains divided? How does he find compromise opportunities with Republicans, as he\\'s expressed interest in doing, when his own party may insist on pulling him leftward?\\nHow does he combat a Covid-19 culture clash over everything from vaccines to mask-wearing when some Americans refuse to trust science and medical experts?\\nIn short, how does he bring together a country that may not want to come together? \\nA Trump victory raises equally meaningful questions\\nConversely, those questions are different but just as meaningful if Trump wins a second term. Will he double down on four years of division? What will that mean for the very real problems he and Congress will have to tackle, especially if the GOP loses control of the Senate? How will the electorate respond? \\nHow do we end the violence in major cities over racial injustice and police brutality? How do we combat Covid when the White House undermines the science? How do we fortify the checks and balances that Congress and the Justice Department have systemically weakened? \\nNo matter what happens in November, what comes next?\\nIt\\'s an overwhelmingly complicated, loaded question if ever there were one, and it\\'s where we want to start a series of conversations.\\nThe systemic and institutional problems America is grappling with will not be resolved in November with an election or January with an inauguration. They may not be resolved within the next year or four. And the way forward is remarkably unclear. \\nFrom race to criminal justice, immigration to gun violence, reproductive rights to LGBTQ rights, tax policy to trade policy, education to climate change, Russia to China, a distrust of science to a distrust of news -- it\\'s imperative that we start having conversations now about tackling these issues that go beyond talking points and political slogans.\\nEach week CNN Opinion will feature an essay by an expert voice outlining how we can move ahead on one of these crucial problems facing America. Following that essay, I\\'ll host other expert voices to engage in a larger conversation, which you can watch on CNN Digital, about tackling those problems in real ways, that don\\'t gloss over the cultural, social, political and economic barriers either administration would inevitably encounter. \\nEach week we\\'ll also ask you, the viewer, to weigh in. What do you think is the path forward for the week\\'s particular problem? Is it new legislation? Community action? Public advocacy? New leadership? Or a combination? And we\\'ll try to address those ideas in our discussions.\\nThese conversations -- what comes next? -- will continue through and past the election, and will be continually reshaped by the news as we learn more about what the next few weeks, months and years will actually look like.\\nAs you prepare to vote in November, it\\'s important to not only weigh the issues that matter to you and the candidates who are promising to make your lives better, but to ask how, exactly, they plan to do that? What will change in November? And what can you do to impact the changes you want to see? We hope this series helps facilitate those kinds of discussions now and after what could be the most important election of our lifetimes.\\n\\n'},\n",

View more opinion at CNN.\\n (CNN)Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\'s death has pulled the High Court once again into the whirlwind of drama of a presidential campaign. In 2016, CNN exit polls found that concern over vacancies on the Court was among the most important factors among Republicans in determining their support of Donald Trump. And for many, Trump delivered.  \\nPresident Trump\\'s success in staffing the federal courts has as much to do with Republican hardball tactics in the Senate as it does with his own commitment to doing so. Justice Ginsburg\\'s death will put these hardball tactics to the test as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already indicated that he will allow a vote to fill Ginsburg\\'s seat and Trump has called for quick action to do so \"without delay.\"  \\nGinsburg\\'s death comes just 46 days before the presidential election and political forecasts lean toward a Biden victory this November. Trump has trailed in national polls as well as in most all polls in battleground states. \\nDespite the fact that voting has already begun in several states the GOP appears to be moving full steam ahead. Only one Supreme Court vacancy has ever been filled this close to a presidential election -- and that was in 1864. This would also be the first Supreme Court appointment by a president after they had been impeached.    \\nIn spite of ascending to the presidency after losing the popular vote, recording historically low presidential approval ratings, and becoming just the third president to be impeached, only Jimmy Carter has appointed more federal judges at a similar point in their presidencies as Trump. The Conservative transformation of the federal courts in recent years has been a point of pride for McConnell and consternation for many Democrats.\\nThe Republicans\\' move to fill Ginsburg\\'s seat has infuriated Democrats who have not forgotten McConnell\\'s refusal to hold a vote over President Barack Obama\\'s nomination of Merrick Garland to the High Court in February of 2016. Back then, McConnel said that the American people should \"have a voice in this momentous decision.\" As noted, the people are currently in the midst of speaking by voting early in several states and many more will be joining them in the next few weeks by casting their votes in advance of the November 3 election. \\nThe Garland appointment went nowhere and the seat remained vacant until Neil Gorsuch was nominated by President Trump and confirmed by the Senate in early 2017. Trump was able to fill a second seat with the controversial appointment of Brett Kavanagh in October of 2018. Just one month later, Democrats had a strong midterm showing, gaining control of the House of Representatives as 40 seats switched party control. \\nWhile this strategy may land the GOP an additional conservative seat on the Court, it may lead to some additional far-reaching consequences that may ultimately not serve their long-term purposes very well. It could also secure a Biden victory and cost Republicans the Senate. If that were to happen, we could expect Democrats to retaliate and use their newfound power aggressively to regain what they believe to be lost ground on the federal courts. It could also bring about major changes to the legislative process.\\nIf 2020 results in another Democratic tidal wave, it would yield Democratic control of the presidency, House, and Senate. If indeed this were to happen, we can expect that Democrats will play hardball of their own by pursuing an agenda that could result in eliminating the filibuster and passing legislation related to voting reform, immigration, health care, and tax reform. And in what would have been unthinkable several months ago, Democrats could very well pass legislation to restructure the federal courts. \\nSen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) suggested as much tweeting: \"It is going to be very hard after the procedural violence that Mitch McConnell has inflicted on the Senate and the country for anyone to justify us playing it soft next year just to satisfy pundits. We must use the power that voters give us to deliver the change we are promising.\" \\nLikewise, Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) tweeted that if McConnell seeks to fill the seat then \"when Democrats control the Senate in the next Congress, we must abolish the filibuster and expand the Supreme Court.\"\\nThroughout the primary season, Democrats discussed major changes of this sort -- from abolishing the Electoral College to increasing the size of the Court. The Republicans\\' move to seize another Supreme Court seat in the midst of an election would provide Democrats with the motivation and excuse to make those changes should they gain power.  \\nPrior to Ginsburg\\'s death, polling showed that voters preferred Biden choose the next Supreme Court Justice. Just as the power to fill vacancies on the Court was a motivating factor for Republicans in 2016, it is likely the same issue could provide a significant boost to Democrats this year. This is especially likely if Republicans continue to move forward with a Trump nomination.  \\nTraditionally, the Court has been seen as a counter-majoritarian check, whereas the electoral process is geared to majoritarian rule. However, the power of the Senate -- and the control it gives to less populated states -- has skewed power into the hands of a minority of the population. Some on the left have argued that the Senate\\'s emphasis on federalism has come at the expense of majoritarian rule. \\nIn addition to the power of the Senate in judicial nominations, the Electoral College has also ceded greater influence to less-populated states as all states receive two electoral votes on the basis of their statehood, regardless of their population. Theoretically this provides greater voting power to less populated states compared to more populated states. For instance, in 2016, an electoral vote in Wyoming represented just under 200,000 citizens, while an electoral vote in California represented over 700,000 citizens.\\nThis is underscored by the fact that we have had two presidents win the office in spite of losing a plurality of the vote in the last five elections. Thus, only half of the remaining justices on the High Court were appointed by presidents who first attained office by winning the popular vote. \\nIn short, our electoral system has enabled a minority of the population to rule, rather than the majority -- or even a plurality. We would not be surprised, then, if McConnell\\'s decision to try and fill the seat ultimately backfires on Republicans by ushering in a unified Democratic government. If that were to happen, Democrats may well choose to wield their power to regain control of the Courts -- especially if they believe that two Supreme Court seats were stolen during Trump\\'s only term.\\nBuckle up America because 2020 -- somehow -- is about to get even worse. \\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Oren Cass is the executive director of American Compass, a conservative economic policy group, and author of \"The Once and Future Worker: A Vision for the Renewal of Work in America.\" The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\\n (CNN)As painful as the Covid-19 economic fallout has been, the unemployment rate today is lower -- and the average rate this year has been lower -- than the average during the four years of former President Barack Obama\\'s first term, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That is no defense of the current catastrophe -- only an observation that the catastrophe is not a once-in-a-century occurrence but one to which Americans have become quite accustomed.\\nFor struggling groups, the picture is even worse. For instance, take men with only a high school degree. In the 1990s, about 73% of them were working at any point in time. That figure fell below 70% after the 2001 recession and never bounced back. Then it fell below 65% following the Great Recession and stayed there through the long, slow recovery. When Covid struck, it went below 55%, and still remains below 60%. This decline represents 4 million fewer men working than had 1990s economic conditions persisted. \\nSo, while ending the pandemic is obviously job one, the more consequential question for policymakers, and for presidential candidates Donald Trump and Joe Biden, is not how to get out of this particular mess but rather how to change the course of an economy that, through booms and busts, has been leaving much of the population behind. \\nHow do we get businesses investing again, rather than merely disgorging profits to shareholders? When growth and investment do happen, how do we ensure that American workers benefit, and benefit broadly -- not just in technology and finance, not just in select cities, not just college graduates? \\nBoth candidates, in their own way, have fallen short in addressing questions like these. President Trump has offered little in the way of a second-term agenda. His campaign website literally has no section dedicated to issues, policies or proposals. Instead it offers a list of \"Promises Kept,\" leading with a section on \"Economy & Jobs\" that claims \"President Trump jump-started America\\'s economy into record growth\" (this is not true) and then highlights the 2017 tax reform that showed no sign of boosting corporate investment, according to analysis published by the American Enterprise Institute.\\nFormer Vice President Biden has no shortage of plans. Indeed, his website\\'s \"Vision\" page features 48 different sections, including separate \"agendas\" for the \"Asian-American & Pacific Islander\" and \"Indian American\" communities. Some facets of this vision show great potential: His \"plan to invest in middle class competitiveness\" includes infrastructure and training proposals. His \"plan for K-12 education\" places needed emphasis on career and technical education that can provide non-college pathways to good careers. His \"plan to ensure the future is \\'made in all of America\\' by all of America\\'s workers\" at least gestures toward the importance of a robust industrial policy that could help domestic manufacturers thrive. Such ideas deserve applause.\\nBut as some proverb surely goes, a man with a million plans has none. The important question is where Biden would focus his attention and, discouragingly, he seems largely committed to a repeat of the Obama administration that he helped lead. His formal acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, typically the most important address of a presidential candidate\\'s campaign, is illustrative. After leading with a mention of infrastructure, the former Vice President turned to \"building on the Affordable Care Act,\" spoke of education reform only in terms of helping college students, doubled down on America\\'s broken and increasingly irrelevant system of organized labor, promised millions of green jobs and ensured us that the wealthy will \"pay their fair share\" in taxes. Sounds familiar?\\nIn principle, Biden\\'s mention of at least some important priorities are preferable to Trump\\'s general silence. In practice, though, his political coalition seems to be steering him into the same wall that Obama struck: Focus on college students and graduates, not the majority of Americans who won\\'t earn even a community college degree. Focus on hypothetical \"green jobs\" intended to replace the existing energy sector\\'s jobs, not a genuine industrial renaissance that by one analysis will require some fossil-fuel power. Focus on whatever Big Labor demands, not reforms that might revitalize the American labor movement at the expense of existing unions. Downplay the excesses of globalization, the abuses of China, the downsides of unrestrained immigration, lest one appear insufficiently progressive and \"open.\" \\nAmerica tried this agenda from 2009 to 2016; the result was, as Biden accidentally argued in his same convention speech, \"young people who have known only an America of rising inequity and shrinking opportunity.\" \\nIt is cliched, but nevertheless true, that doing the same thing and expecting a different result is insanity. A new mindset and new strategies are needed for America to turn an economic corner, so that its booms are longer and better, its busts shorter and shallower, and its prosperity shared more widely. \\nTop priorities should be boosting domestic investment and innovation and returning critical manufacturing and supply chains to our shores. Government should invest more aggressively alongside industry on technological breakthroughs, as it once did for semiconductors and jet engines. For some products, mandates should simply require that key components be made in America.\\nWe have to build clear pathways to good careers that don\\'t just run through college campuses. For some people and some vocations, a leafy campus is the right next step after high school. For most, it is not. Even among those who do graduate from college, about 40% end up in jobs that do not require their degrees. Teenagers need the opportunity to earn practical skills and even spend time in the workplace. And then they deserve at least as much public support in employer training programs as they get in traditional higher education. \\nOnce their careers are underway, workers also need to have real power in the labor market and representation on the job, without kneecapping employers in the process. Americans take for granted our dysfunctional system of \"enterprise level\" bargaining, where workers at individual companies must fight to organize and then bargain with their employer. This creates enormous hostility, and it places companies that do unionize at a competitive disadvantage. \\nAn alternative, which is already standard in many western democracies, is called \"sectoral bargaining.\" Instead of the organizing and bargaining happening company by company, trade associations representing all of an industry\\'s employers, and unions representing all of the industry\\'s workers, negotiate employment rules that will apply industry-wide. Workers help determine how their workplaces will operate, and employers win in the marketplace with innovation, productivity, and service instead of trying to undercut each other on labor. \\nBoth Biden and Trump have said and done things that could suggest an interest in major industrial, education and labor reform. Neither has indicated he is serious.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)President Donald Trump faced life outside his own political bubble on Tuesday, where his self-congratulation, buck passing and audacious falsehoods conspicuously failed to meet the moment when he was confronted by undecided voters.\\nTrump appeared at an ABC News town hall in Philadelphia, and peppered a socially distanced audience with the rhetoric and talking points that delight his loyal base. But if his goal was to satisfy relatively small groups of voters who polls show haven\\'t yet made up their mind, the President appeared to fall short and rarely addressed the substance of questions about his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, race relations and health care. \\nIt was an unusual moment of exposure for a leader who demands constant public praise from his subordinates. On Tuesday night, audience members granted him the respect due to his office but none of the adulation he craves.\\nTrump was largely cordial and likely came across as strong to voters that love him. But his performance offered Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden multiple openings only two weeks before their first debate clash -- one of the last potential turning points of the White House race. First-term presidents who have spent years expecting deference from everyone they meet often get a shock in the first debate showdown with a challenger keen to get in their grill. Tuesday\\'s event suggests the surprise may be especially acute for Trump when he faces Biden on September 29.\\nAnswers that normally draw wild cheers at Trump\\'s packed campaign events fell flat when he was confronted by voters who appeared to want to cut through bluster and propaganda. And his responses did little to recognize the magnitude of the challenges facing the nation in a fearful year, suggesting that the President has yet to find the language or the appeals that might turn around an election he so far seems to be losing.\\nOn a day when America recorded more than 1,200 new deaths from Covid-19, Trump effectively told the country to ignore his own words to Bob Woodward downplaying the threat early this year even though he knew how bad it was.\\nHe said he did a \"tremendous\" job on the virus, insisted \"it\\'s going to disappear\" and that \"a lot of people think masks are not good.\" Asked who said masks aren\\'t good, Trump replied, \"Waiters.\" He bizarrely said \"herd mentality\" would make it go away, in an apparent reference to herd immunity that medical experts say could cost several million lives. The President has pounced on Biden\\'s verbal slips as evidence that he lacks the mental capacity to be President. But his own confusing answers after six months supposedly leading the national effort to fight the pandemic failed to inspire confidence that he fully understands the implications of the emergency even now. \\nHe also illogically complained that Biden, who has no power, had not followed through on a national mask mandate and claimed falsely the US response to the crisis was the best in the world. And the President denied any blame for how the pandemic has turned out -- placing the entire responsibility on China, where the virus first emerged, and several times complained he is not getting the credit he deserves.\\nAt the end of the night, the President was asked by a voter named Ashley West to cite the most difficult part of his presidency and asked what he had learned from it -- and in a way that seemed jarring given that the 200,000th American will soon die from the disease, the President reflected on his own personal sense of loss.\\n\"I learned that life is very fragile. I knew people that were powerful people, strong people, good people, and they got knocked out by this, and died. Six people. It was five until about two weeks ago. Now, it\\'s six,\" Trump said.\\nTrump defends himself\\nThe President became most exercised when denying reports that he referred to US war dead as \"losers\" and \"suckers,\" calling them \"fake.\" He made halting attempts to show empathy to a new US citizen from the Dominican Republic who lost her mother to breast cancer complications a month ago and asked him a question about immigration. Trump responded by telling her that it was terrible that people died alone in hospital due to Covid-19 -- and turned the answer into an infomercial for his pandemic leadership. Biden, who has buried a first wife and two children in a life marked by tragedy, is highlighting his own empathy as a balm for the country at a grief-wracked moment.\\nTrump shrugged off questioners who asked him if he agreed America needed to reexamine its painful history on race, again arguing that there were a few \"bad apples\" in the police force who \"choked\" in incidents in which unarmed Black Americans were killed. \\nThe President also falsely claimed that Democrats wanted to remove protections for patients with pre-existing conditions introduced under Obamacare. His own administration is currently arguing a Supreme Court case trying to destroy the Affordable Care Act, while Democrats seek to preserve the law. While Trump says he would protect pre-existing conditions, he has offered no credible health plan.\\nThe President\\'s appearance came in a crucial swing state at a moment when he is trailing Biden by nine points in the CNN Poll of Polls as the country faces concurrent crises: a pandemic, the consequent economic crash, a racial reckoning and historic fires in Western states.\\nNine percent of voters in a CNN/SSRS poll this month said they might still change their mind about who they will vote for. Trump\\'s task in the election appears to be to add less fervent voters to his coalition after spending four years incessantly playing to his base. But while his strongest moments Tuesday came on ending foreign wars and on the economy, and he likely pleased supporters with his unequivocal pro-police statements, the President offered few new policies or approaches at the event that differed from positions in three years when his approval rating has rarely climbed above the low 40s.\\nTrump\\'s campaign insists untapped seams of pro-Trump voters who sat on the sidelines in 2016 are being ignored by pollsters and will embrace the President\\'s hardline culture war rhetoric to sweep him to a second term.\\nTrump again denies evidence of his own voice\\nThe town hall event exactly seven weeks before Election Day was a reminder of the kind of chaos, falsehoods and divisiveness that is a selling point for the President\\'s most faithful voters but is the kind of behavior that may prompt an undecided voter to turn away.\\nThe stream of lies and alternative realities that the President promoted recalled a statement attributed to former Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats in Woodward\\'s book \"Rage\" that was published on Tuesday.\\n\"To him a lie is not a lie. It\\'s just what he thinks. He doesn\\'t know the difference between the truth and a lie,\" Coats is quoted as saying to former Secretary of Defense James Mattis.\\nSuch commentary was borne out when Trump responded to a question by a first time voter from Pittsburgh who asked why he was captured on tapes made by Woodward as downplaying the pandemic.\\n\"Yeah, well, I didn\\'t downplay it. I, actually, in many ways, I up-played it, in terms of action,\" he said.\\nIn essence, the President is inviting voters to refuse to believe the evidence of their own ears on his early attitude to the worst domestic crisis since World War II that has now killed 195,000 Americans and pitched 30 million out of work.\\nHe is implicitly arguing that not only does he not deserve any blame for a response that lags other industrialized nations -- the US has 4% of the world\\'s population and more than 20% of the Covid-19 cases and deaths.\\nBut such a view relies on an interpretation that distorts the traditional sense that the buck stops on the Oval Office desk and instead relies on voters to believe a flagrant act of salesmanship that defies the reality of their own lives.\\nAfter Trump told Fox News earlier Tuesday that he had read Woodward\\'s book on Monday night, and found it \"boring,\" Woodward said that the President was living in an \"Orwellian world.\"\\n\"He was told, he knew, he told me about it,\" the veteran reporter told CNN\\'s Anderson Cooper.\\n\"I don\\'t know, to be honest, whether he\\'s got it straight in his head what is real and what is unreal.\"\\nThis story has been updated to reflect the figures of Tuesday\\'s coronavirus death toll after a correction by Johns Hopkins University.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)Partisan battle lines were clearly drawn on Monday when the confirmation hearing of Judge Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump\\'s choice to fill the seat of the late liberal icon, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, got underway in a bitterly divided Senate with Election Day just weeks away.\\nSharply divergent narratives emerged in opening speeches as Republican senators praised Barrett\\'s judicial qualifications in glowing terms and emphasized her capability as a working mom, while Democrats warned that health care protections and the Affordable Care Act are at stake, and will be under threat, if the confirmation succeeds.  \\nThe hearing already appears on track to be a firestorm as Republicans push forward with almost unprecedented speed and Democrats look for ways to draw out the process for the lifetime appointment. Meanwhile, across the street at the Supreme Court, the remaining eight justices, who have just begun a new term, find themselves, and the court, once again in an unwelcome political spotlight. \\nOne after another, Republicans used their time at the hearing to highlight Barrett\\'s qualifications to be appointed to the high court.\\nSenate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, described Barrett as \"in a category of excellence,\" saying that she is \"highly respected,\" and \"widely-admired for her integrity.\" \\nRepublican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who like Graham is up for reelection this cycle, told Barrett during the hearing, that \"folks with widely different judicial philosophies agree that you are brilliant, respectful, kind.\" \\nCornyn also indicated that his constituents have expressed admiration at how Barrett balances her career with taking care of her family. \\n\"Judge, there\\'s a question that comes up in my discussions with my constituents that\\'s really more basic and more personal: They want to know how you do it? How do you and your husband manage two full-time, professional careers and at the same time take care of your large family?\" Cornyn said, adding, \"I bet there are many young women, like my own two daughters, who marvel at the balance you\\'ve achieved between your personal and professional life.\" \\nDemocrats, in contrast, were united in warning that Barrett\\'s confirmation stands to jeopardize health care access and protections -- a central part of the strategy they have so far employed in fighting the nomination.  \\nSen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee\\'s top Democrat, argued that \"the stakes are extraordinarily high\" in the fight over the vacancy, adding, \"most importantly, healthcare coverage for millions of Americans is at stake with this nomination.\"\\nDemocrats framed the issue in personal terms, sharing concerns from constituents and, in some cases, opening up about their own health conditions. \\nSen. Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said that his constituents are deeply concerned over what the confirmation could mean. \\n\"They\\'re scared, Judge Barrett. They\\'re scared that your confirmation would rip from them the very health care protections that millions of Americans have fought to maintain, and which Congress has repeatedly rejected eliminating,\" he said. \\nLeahy went on to say, \"They\\'re scared that the clock will be turned back to a time when women had no right to control their own bodies and when it was acceptable to discriminate against women in the workplace. They\\'re scared that at a time when we\\'re facing the perilous impacts of climate change, bedrock environmental protections are going to be eviscerated, and they\\'re scared that your confirmation will result in the rolling back of voting rights, workers\\' rights, and the rights of the LGBTQ community to equal treatment.\"\\nDemocratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii opened up about her own battle with cancer. \\n\"Access to health care saved my life,\" Hirono said, adding that a diagnosis of kidney cancer \"came as a total shock.\"\\n\"Serious illness can hit anyone unexpectedly - it did for me, and when it does, no one should have to worry about whether they can afford care that might save their life,\" she said. \\n\\'This is going to be a long, contentious week\\'\\nIn a preview of the bitter battle ahead, Graham warned, \"this is going to be a long, contentious week, I would just ask one thing of the committee: to the extent possible, let\\'s make it respectful, let\\'s make it challenging, let\\'s remember the world is watching.\" \\nThe chairman acknowledged that the rapid confirmation timeline taking place in an election year, but defended the process. \\n\"There\\'s nothing unconstitutional about this process. This is a vacancy that has occurred through the tragic loss of a great woman and we\\'re going to fill that vacancy with another great woman. The bottom line here is that the Senate is doing its duty constitutionally,\" he said.  \\nFeinstein agreed with Graham\\'s sentiment that the hearing should be respectful, saying that Democrats \"feel the same way.\" \\nFeinstein, however, argued that Republicans should not be pushing ahead with the nomination, referencing how Senate Republicans blocked consideration of Merrick Garland after his nomination by former President Obama.  \\n\"I believe we should not be moving forward on this nomination, not until the election has ended and the next president has taken office,\" she said. \\nSen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah who tested positive for coronavirus at the beginning of the month, attended the hearing in person. \"Senator Lee is back,\" Graham noted at the start of the hearing, saying that he has been cleared by his physician and welcoming him back. \\nLee delivered his opening statement while in the committee room without wearing a mask. On Twitter, he posted a letter from the congressional attending physician stating that he has \"met criteria to end COVID-19 isolation.\" \\nThe hearings will serve as a touchstone for the bases of both parties, highlighting the potential of a hard-right turn that could last for decades in areas such as abortion, religious liberty, LGBTQ rights and the Second Amendment, distracting voters from the realities of Covid-19 and leaving liberals to contemplate new tools, including adding seats to the Supreme Court, to staunch their wounds. \\nBarrett, who sat through contentious hearings just three years ago for her seat on the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals, delivered her opening statement at the end of the first day after being sworn in.  \\n\"The policy decisions and value judgments of government must be made by the political branches elected by and accountable to the people,\" Barrett told senators, adding, \"That is the approach that I have strived to follow as a judge on the 7th circuit.\" \\nHer straightforward statement reflects a conservative legal philosophy shared by her mentor, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, and others who believe that courts can\\'t sweep in to solve all of society\\'s woes. She makes clear that she believes some issues are better handled by the political branches, which mirrors what conservative justices said in dissent when the high court cleared the way for same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015.\\nNodding to the divisive Kavanaugh hearings, Barrett admitted to some trepidation about accepting the nomination. \"The confirmation process -- and the work of serving on the Court if confirmed -- requires sacrifices, particularly from my family,\" the mother of seven said. \\nShe also pointed out in her statement that she would bring diversity to the court, in part because every current justice attended an Ivy League school. A graduate of the University of Notre Dame, she would also be the first mother with school-age children to serve on the bench. \\nMindful that she is vying for the seat of Ginsburg -- a feminist icon -- Barrett praised the late justice for \"the path she marked and the life she led.\" Left unsaid was the fact that the two women are ideological opposites. \\nShe ended her statement with a flourish -- highlighting her faith and the fact that she believes in the \"power of prayer\" and has been uplifted to hear that so many people are \"praying for me.\" \\nA nominee\\'s opening statement often sets the tone for the start of the hearing. Following Barrett\\'s statement, the committee adjourned until Tuesday for when the grilling is expected to begin. \\nVoting rights\\nBefore even reaching substantive constitutional questions, Democrats are expected to ask Barrett whether she will recuse herself from any election-related litigation that reaches the high court. Although it\\'s a long shot, it is always possible the Supreme Court will once again be called upon to decide the election. \\n\"I think this will end up at the Supreme Court,\" Trump said at a recent White House event. \"And I think it\\'s very important that we have nine justices.\"\\nBarrett is likely to avoid the question, but if she is confirmed it will be her own choice whether to recuse. \\nAffordable Care Act\\nDemocrats during Monday\\'s hearing turned the focus on the Affordable Care Act. A week after Election Day, the justices will hear the most important case of the term and decide whether to invalidate the entire law. The decision could strip millions of their health care during a pandemic. Critics of Barrett will point to some of her previous writings, before she took the bench, where she expressed skepticism about the reasoning Chief Justice John Roberts used back in 2012 to uphold the law under the taxing power. \\n\"Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute,\" she wrote. \"He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power. \\n\"Had he treated the payment as the statute did -- as a penalty -- he would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond Congress\\'s commerce power,\" she said. The challenge before the court now is different, but it rests in part on Roberts\\' original opinion. \\nRoe v. Wade\\nDemocrats will also seize on positions Barrett took before she was a judge, on Roe v. Wade -- the 1973 landmark decision legalizing abortion. Unlike other recent nominees, there is a significant paper trail detailing Barrett\\'s views on abortion, and Roe, as a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.  \\nShe signed a petition, for example, with other faculty, for a paid advertisement reaffirming the school\\'s commitment \"to the right to life\" and criticizing Roe. \"In the 40 years since the infamous Roe v. Wade decision over 55 million unborn children have been killed by abortions,\" the ad reads. \\nIn 2006, she added her name to a list of \"citizens of Michiana\" who signed a \"right to life ad\" sponsored by a group that opposes abortion that appeared in the South Bend Tribune. The ad from the Saint Joseph County Right to Life calls for putting \"an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade and restor(ing) laws that protect the lives of unborn children.\" \\nLate Friday night, Barrett released a supplement to her Senate questionnaire, including the ad and outlining previously undisclosed talks she gave in 2013 to anti-abortion students groups after CNN\\'s KFile reported their existence. \\nIn 2016, before taking the bench, she said, \"I don\\'t think the core case -- Roe\\'s core holding that, you know, women have a right to an abortion -- I don\\'t think that would change,\" she said. \"But I think the question of whether people can get very late-term abortions, how many restrictions can be put on clinics -- I think that would change.\"\\nAt her 2017 Senate confirmation hearing for a seat on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, she was pressed on whether her own personal convictions would impact how she applies the law. \"If there is ever a conflict between a judge\\'s personal conviction and that judge\\'s duty under the rule of law, that it is never, ever permissible for that judge to follow their personal convictions in the decision of the case rather than what the law requires,\" she said. \\nHer critics point to two opinions from her time as a judge. In both she voted to rehear cases where a smaller panel of judges ruled against abortion restrictions. That desire to take another look at the laws leads her critics to believe she would have voted to uphold those restrictions.\\nBarrett also voted with the majority in an opinion upholding a \"bubble zone\" ordinance in Chicago, which bars abortion opponents from approaching someone within 8 feet in the vicinity of a clinic if the purpose is to engage in protest. Her critics note, however, that even though she voted in favor of supporters of abortion rights, the opinion makes clear the lower court was bound by Supreme Court precedent. \\nSecond Amendment\\nLast term, four conservative justices urged the court to take up a Second Amendment case, yet by the end of the term they had declined to do so. That suggests there wasn\\'t the necessary five votes. Now, if Barrett is nominated, she could be that vote. \\nIn one decision, Kanter v. Barr, she dissented when her colleagues upheld a law barring convicted felons from possessing a firearm. The language she used in the opinion tracked closely with language used by conservative Justice Clarence Thomas. Like Thomas, Barrett suggested that lower courts are thumbing their nose at Supreme Court precedent to uphold gun restrictions treating the Second Amendment like a \"second class right.\" \\nIn the upcoming hearings Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, has vowed to make her views \"front and center\" to show how \"Judge Barrett\\'s extremist, hard-right views of the Second Amendment will do real harm to real lives in real ways.\" \\nSame-sex marriage\\nBarrett does not have a robust record on same-sex marriage, but in a 2016 speech at Jacksonville University made while she was still a law professor, she laid out both sides of the debate. \\nShe framed it as a  \"who decides\" question. That is very similar to how Roberts framed the issue when he dissented in the landmark 2015 case Obergefell v. Hodges, which cleared the way for same-sex marriage nationwide. \\nHe said the issue would have been better handled by the political branches. Speaking broadly, Barrett was asked about the future of the court in the speech and she seemed to align herself with Roberts\\' thinking. \"The \\'who decides\\' question,\" she said, \"is really important to me -- I worry a lot about that \\'who decides\\' question, about our decisions, and my voice being taken away.\" \\nImmigration\\nMany of Barrett\\'s critics fear that on the bench she will greenlight Trump\\'s policies if he wins another term. In one immigration-related case, she dissented when her colleagues temporarily blocked a Trump administration rule that puts green card holders at a disadvantage if they access public services. \\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Monday.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Judith Resnik is the Arthur Liman professor of law at Yale Law School and author of the essay, \"Judicial Selection and Democratic Theory: Demand, Supply, and Life Tenure.\" The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion at CNN.\\n (CNN)As the Senate Judiciary Committee begins hearings over Judge Amy Coney Barrett\\'s appointment to the US Supreme Court, the size of the nine-member court has become an election issue. If, as expected, Barrett is confirmed, the toxic polarization gripping the nation could be further mirrored in federal courts, which are supposed to be places where open-minded judges aim to treat all people equally and render just decisions.\\nHowever, to focus only on the number of Supreme Court justices is to miss the systemic issues essential to a fair judiciary. Tens of hundreds of judges in lower courts — both with and without life tenure — decide the vast bulk of the country\\'s cases. To decide what needs to be changed, it is essential to know how these judges are selected, how long they stay in power and how the Supreme Court gets its cases.\\nWhat the federal courts actually look like\\nThe federal courts are usually depicted as a three-tiered pyramid of life-tenured judges at the district, appellate and Supreme Court. But, in fact, hundreds of federal judges do not have life tenure. In the 1960s and 1980s, Congress enacted laws that added two new judicial positions: magistrate and bankruptcy judges.\\nMagistrate judges, selected by life-tenured district court judges, have eight-year renewable terms. Bankruptcy judges, chosen by appellate court judges, have 14-year terms. In practice, almost all are renewed. When the sets\\' numbers are added together, these non-life tenured judges number around 950 — about 100 more than their life-tenured counterparts.\\nTheir titles may make their work seem quotidian. Not so. Some of the major issues of today — like the bankruptcy of opiate manufacturers — are pending before judges without life tenure.\\nOther federal adjudicators sit in agencies. About 2,000 are called administrative law judges; thousands more are hearing officers. They are part of the federal government\\'s civil service, and they rule on scores of cases about Social Security, veteran benefits, labor immigration and other hot button issues.\\nIn addition, states have thousands more judges getting their jobs through a variety of methods, from merit selection panels to executive or legislature appointments to direct voting — and more.\\nThis array demonstrates, first, that because in this democracy, all of us are eligible to seek relief in courts for our many rights, we need large numbers of judges to hear claims. Second, democracy does not dictate any one method for selecting judges.\\nBut democracy does tell us what we want: fair and equal treatment of all people. It also tells us what we don\\'t want: a small cadre of political partisans deciding who holds the power of judgment for decades.\\nRe-envisioning the federal judiciary\\nThe numbers make plain that the Supreme Court has only a slice of the action. That court decides about 80 cases a year. Federal appellate courts (usually working as panels of three) hear about 50,000 cases a year.  And huge power resides at the trial level, where individual judges are the gatekeepers to the system. About 360,000 civil and criminal cases come in yearly, in addition to about 853,000 bankruptcy petitions.\\nThese numbers represent a small fraction of the caseload, because it is state courts where tens of millions of cases are filed annually.\\nRather than bemoan the volume of filings, this volume should be viewed as a marker of success: people believe that courts are places that can provide remedies.\\nWhat are the problems then? Too few people — many life-tenured judges — hold too much power for too long.  And just because life tenure dates back to the founding does not mean it is operating in the same way now as it was then, which is another reason reform is needed.\\nI learned from delving into the early days of the US that from 1789 to 1809, 63 life-tenured judges sat on all the federal courts across the (much smaller) United States. On average, Supreme Court justices held that office for 14 years, and lower court judges served for 16 years. Fast forward to the end of the 20th century. Between 1983 and 2003, 530 sitting life-tenured jurists were on the bench for 24 years, on average. Many factors account for the increased length of service, including appointing people at earlier ages, longer life expectancies and promotions of judges from one level to another.\\nRethinking what life tenure means is therefore in order. The Constitution guarantees a term of office for Supreme and lower court judges \"during good Behavior.\" That phrasing has been interpreted to mean staying in office until a judge retires (sometimes strategically) or dies. But that reading is not inevitable. The 1780 Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, for example, uses similar words, and the state had a mandatory age-based retirement.\\nMoreover, constitutional courts in several other countries (like Italy and Germany) come with fixed terms or with mandatory age-based retirement (Canada and the UK). In short, ensuring judicial independence through unqualified terms for a person\\'s life is not the only way to get accomplished and able judges.\\nAnother way to reallocate power is to have judges appointed to the federal courts not be locked into one slot. A version of this practice exists now. Retired Supreme Court justices occasionally sit on appellate courts — for example, Justice David Souter on the First Circuit — and lower court judges regularly sit \"by designation\" on appellate courts or move from one district because help is needed to staff the cases. \\nA related reform would be for confirmation to the Supreme Court to come with a cap — pegged to ensure that every four years, a president has the opportunity to nominate a justice, or to intervals when the US Senate membership shifts. Justices who cycle off the high court would still be life-tenured, and they would move to sit on lower federal courts. \\nAdding judges has a useful function because, when the numbers go up, the stakes of any one position go down. Expanding the number of seats on the Supreme or other courts should also entail retooling the process for deciding and choosing cases, all to dilute the concentration of power in any one individual.\\nCritics say that too many judges cannot work together and that the law gets too messy. But disagreement about law is the lifeblood of vibrant democracies. Ideas about how to have larger groups of justices work constructively together come from constitutional democracies that, like the US, are committed to judicial independence and excellence. For example, the UK\\'s Supreme Court has a bench of 12 justices, who sit on panels of five or more. Were the US to add justices and use panels, predicting 5-4 or 6-3 outcomes would no longer be possible.\\nNo discussion of power on the Supreme Court should miss a key facet: the court\\'s control over the docket. During the 20th century, the court gained authority to set its own agenda — four justices can put a case onto the calendar. This means that justices can shop for facts and issues to pursue legal agendas. An alternative exists, as suggested by a group of law professors some years ago: Congress can create or the Supreme Court could delegate to a rotating body of lower court judges the primary role in selecting the cases to be heard by the high court and thereby lower the risk of politicization in case selection.\\nThese proposals are but some of the many ideas about how to redeem and liberate the country from the democratic deficits in the Senate and the presidency. To revive American democracy requires that a small group of people not be able to entrench their views of law\\'s obligations and close off opportunities to debate the meaning and impact of our norms.\\nDemocracy may not instruct us specifically on how to pick judges, but it does tell us a good deal about securing rights to justice, equality before the law and constraints on state power. And those precepts mean that no one person ought to hold too much power for too long.\\n\\n'},\n",

The views expressed in this commentary belong to the authors. View more opinion at CNN.\\n (CNN)Soon, hopefully, former Vice President Joe Biden may be able to atone for missteps made by him, as well as State and Local officials, in designing a criminal justice system that perpetually disenfranchises people of color and the poor. Earlier this year, when the former vice president spoke on justice issues, he recognized his shortcomings: \"I know we haven\\'t always gotten things right, but I\\'ve always tried.\" \\nClearly, \"trying\" by Biden and others hasn\\'t been enough. The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, a result of decades of bipartisan legislation -- like the 1994 Crime Bill -- that propped up institutional racism. About 2.3 million people are locked up in jails and prisons, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, and 40% of those locked up are Black Americans, who in turn only make up 13% of the general population. \\nWhile elected officials have publicly recognized that the justice system needs to be overhauled, they have stopped short of acknowledging the justice system, at all levels, is stacked against communities of color. As scholars like Michelle Alexander have laid bare, The American justice system is designed to keep people of color oppressed It is not broken. Many have argued, it is doing exactly what it was designed to do. Policies that promise change but do not address the structural racism in our justice system are empty. In fact, Biden, who is leading in the polls, helped draft that 1994 crime bill, which led to increased federal financial support of local police departments and their militarization. \\nTo be fair, Biden has evolved on this issue in the years before he became former President Barack Obama\\'s number two. He backed the Second Chance Act of 2007, which provides services to formerly incarcerated individuals and has gone a long way to lowering the recidivism rate. In his last few years in the Senate, Biden also supported the full elimination of the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. This drastically reduced the disproportionate arrest rate of people of color provoked by the racially motivated war on drugs, the effects of which are still widely felt today.\\nIn his bid for president, Biden has called for a federal ban on police chokeholds, a federal police oversight commission, national standards on police use of force, more federal mandatory data collection from local law enforcement and more oversight power for the Department of Justice to investigate local police departments.\\nIn addition, the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force launched in May has made recommendations on a range of issues including pledging to reform an American justice system that has criminalized poverty and overpoliced and underserved Black and brown communities.\\nWhile President Donald Trump has been credited with the passage of the First Step Act in 2018, which won bipartisan support, the law has not led to decarceration and fails to address systemic inequalities in our justice system.\\nHowever, while the act has been hailed as groundbreaking, it is not without its faults. The Brennan Center has found that large parts of the law remain unenforced and underfunded. Moreover, much of the bill only reinstated existing rules, and yet another study found that it has proven ineffective at reducing the number of people in federal custody. This leaves the bill open to being panned as a PR move by the Trump administration to impress Black voters. \\nThe Act also brought forward the use of risk assessments, which has only gone on to further exacerbate racial biases and that institutionalize structural racism that already exist by relying on data such as \"zip code\" and \"age at first arrest\" -- products of over-policing of Black people and communities of color, rather than risk of actual behavior.\\nThe US needs a bold agenda that goes further than small reforms or hollow PR moves reshaping the justice system as a whole. Biden, in taking on justice reform, must address the root causes of incarceration, restructure policing protocol and fund community health and wellness programs instead of more prisons.\\nThis challenge is not insurmountable. It\\'s a question of simple economics. We need to eliminate the economic ecosystem that fuels this unjust system. \\nSupporting Society \\nBiden can make a strong first step and support the BREATHE Act, legislation which proposes eliminating the federal government\\'s ability to give multimillion-dollar grants that enable police force militarization and calls for a \"time-bound plan\" to close all federal prisons and immigration detention centers. The Federal Bureau of Prisons pandemic response has demonstrated what has been called a lack of regard for basic humanity creating deadly conditions for those incarcerated. \\nNext, Biden would need to undo the 1994 Crime Bill, which made incarceration financially attractive to state governments. Actions here would move federal funding for prisons to community-led programs that provide resources to address issues like addiction, weak educational services, homelessness and mental-health crises that frequently lead to incarceration. This is not extreme thinking. In Boston this summer, Mayor Marty Walsh redirected 20% of the police force\\'s overtime budget, or $12 million, to social programs, a cogent example of how this can be done at the local level.\\nPrison Reform and a Chance to Thrive\\nWe need to take the \"industrial\" out of the prison industrial complex. More than 4,100 corporations use prison labor directly or through supply chains. Individuals working within the prison system should receive a living wage, according to the Fair Labor Standards Act. To bring down this house of cards, the 180 publicly traded companies that directly profit through the prison system must be compelled to divest their operations in this sector.\\nHowever, this is not enough. We need to keep people from reincarceration. To break the cycle of recidivism, we must eliminate discriminatory practices that disproportionately affect those who have been incarcerated, and make formerly incarcerated people a protected class when it comes to employment, housing and health-care access.\\nAccording to a 50-state analysis from the Council of State Governments Justice Center, 40 states,  including Pennsylvania and Alabama, bar certain segments of the incarcerated population from accessing continued education. And, while some states may argue there isn\\'t enough funding to provide incarcerated people with skills training and other educational paths, the report found that only three states use all federal funding streams available to them for this exact purpose. This is a travesty because people who take vocational courses in prison are 28% more likely to find a job in their community than those who don\\'t. \\nWe must also guarantee the right to vote for incarcerated people. In only two states, Maine and Vermont do incarcerated or detained people have the right to vote. It\\'s important to note that the prison population in each is overwhelmingly white. But if we look to more racially diverse states, like Florida, we see a different story unfold. \\nFor decades, if not centuries, incarcerated Floridians have experienced voting disenfranchisement, both while detained or incarcerated and after release. In 2018, Floridians voted by a two-thirds majority to restore the right to vote to the formerly incarcerated. However in 2019, the legislature and governor effectively passed a poll tax, keeping many from exercising the right to vote, not to mention, thwarting the will of the people of Florida, a law that was upheld by the Federal Court of Appeals. Of course, Florida is not the only state where incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people are kept from voting, it is just another example of the intentional disenfranchisement of Black and brown voters. \\nIf you truly want people to participate in society, you do not pass laws that keep them from doing so.\\nChange Now\\nThe responsibility is with us to change this and treat each other with respect and love, including our neighbors who have experienced prison or detention, because solidarity is the only form of activism that holds hope for our collective liberation.\\nWhat side of history will the Democratic Party choose? Without fundamental changes, claims of solidarity with communities of color ring hollow. We have an opportunity right now to right the course of history and take the opportunity to lead our country into true and lasting justice.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Peter Bergen is CNN\\'s national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the editor of the Coronavirus Daily Brief and author of the new book \"Trump and His Generals: The Cost of Chaos.\" The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\\n (CNN)Retired Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, who was President Trump\\'s national security adviser from February 2017 to April 2018, has written a book that will likely confound both the President\\'s fans and his critics.\\nIn the preface to \"Battlegrounds,\" McMaster acknowledges that despite the advice of friends, editors, agents and even family members, he chose not to write a paean to Trump \"as an unconventional leader who ... advanced American interests,\" nor did he write a takedown depicting the President as \"a bigoted narcissist unfit for office,\" despite the fact that writing either of these types of books \"might be lucrative.\"\\nSo, for those hoping for a tell-all book along the lines of John Bolton\\'s \"The Room Where it Happened,\" which was written by McMaster\\'s successor as national security adviser and that oozed contempt for Trump, \"Battlegrounds\" will disappoint. \\nNor is McMaster\\'s book a full-throated defense of Trump\\'s record, such as the 2019 book, \"The Case for Trump\" by the historian Victor Davis Hanson -- a colleague of McMaster\\'s at Stanford University\\'s Hoover Institution -- which attempted to make the best case for the President.\\nBut in the long run, McMaster\\'s book will likely have a far longer shelf life than the tell-all books about Trump or the books that laud the President because McMaster ably outlines the national security challenges facing the United States that will last long after Trump leaves office.\\nAs McMaster explains, \"I wanted to write a book that might help transcend the vitriol of partisan political discourse and help readers better understand the most significant challenges to security, freedom and prosperity.\"\\nBy implication, McMaster\\'s book advances the view that when it comes to US foreign policy, \"politics stops at the water\\'s edge,\" as the then-chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Arthur Vandenberg, famously observed at the beginning of the Cold War in 1947.\\nThis view is not surprising when you consider that McMaster never voted during the three and half decades that he served under six presidents, a fact that he reveals early on in \"Battlegrounds.\"\\nThe book operates on several levels: It\\'s a lively memoir of McMaster\\'s time in office, and a scholarly, engaging history and deep analysis of the wide range of national security threats that face the United States and its allies.\\nHowever, there are areas of clear disagreement between McMaster and Trump over American national security policy that McMaster\\'s book also articulates.\\nAn early tell about how McMaster sees the world is his book\\'s subtitle: \"The Fight To Defend the Free World.\" It signals that \"Battlegrounds\" will not be a jingoistic apologia for \\'America First,\\' but rather the book assumes that Afghans liberated from the Taliban and Iraqis freed from the yoke of Saddam Hussein are as much part of the effort to defend the free world as Americans are. The framing of \"the free world\" also seems to differ from President Trump, whose fawning admiration for authoritarian leaders from Russia\\'s Vladimir Putin to North Korea\\'s Kim Jong Un is well known.\\nIn \"Battlegrounds\" there is no score-settling, which has been a feature of so many of the books about the Trump White House. Despite their somewhat rocky relationship, McMaster doesn\\'t even mention Trump\\'s former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis once in his 545-page book about US national security. Nor does McMaster mention Steve Bannon, who was Trump\\'s chief strategist for seven months when McMaster was national security adviser, despite the fact that they both clashed repeatedly about the best way forward in Afghanistan.\\nThe key big idea in \"Battlegrounds\" is that Americans are often guilty of \"strategic narcissism\" and that they should invest in greater \"strategic empathy.\" Empathy of course, is not a synonym for sympathy; it is simply trying to put yourself in someone else\\'s shoes -- whether they are an ally or an enemy -- in order to understand their points of view, even if you might profoundly disagree with them. (McMaster\\'s former boss, of course, is not someone who engages in much \"strategic empathy,\" and \"America First\" seems like the height of \"strategic narcissism.\")\\nAn important example of US strategic narcissism was the erroneous lesson many Americans derived from the first Gulf War after Saddam Huseein seized Kuwait in 1990 and the Iraqi army -- the fourth largest in the world at the time -- was subsequently easily defeated by the US military.\\nIndeed, then-Capt. McMaster led a tank battle during the Gulf War that lasted only 23 minutes, in which his force destroyed an astonishing 28 Iraqi tanks, 16 personnel carriers and more than 30 trucks.\\nMcMaster writes that the easy victory against Saddam led many Americans to presume that \"military competition was over,\" given the US technological overmatch of any likely opponent.\\nThis led to the overconfidence that underpinned the botched 2003 invasion of Iraq, which, at least initially, was an easy victory against Saddam\\'s conventional army. But soon Iraqi insurgents started deploying unconventional tactics such as suicide attacks and improvised explosive devices that bogged down the US military in Iraq for years.\\nThe United States subsequently overlearned from the failures of the Iraq War and swung back to what McMaster describes as a policy of \"resignation\" under President Barack Obama, who didn\\'t appreciate \"the risks of inaction\" when it came to not enforcing his own \"red line\" against the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad\\'s use of chemical weapons against his own people in 2013. This policy also led the Obama administration to pull out of Iraq at the end of 2011, which helped pave the way for the subsequent rise of ISIS. \\nIn other words, in US foreign policy, strategic narcissism can lead both to sins of commission and omission.\\nPutin\\nJust as the swift victory over Saddam in the first Gulf War produced American strategic narcissism, so too did the contemporaneous collapse of the Soviet Union, which some presumed meant history had \"ended\" and that the self-evident benefits of liberal democracy, embodied in the United States, would ensure that liberal democracies would become the preferred mode of governance everywhere.\\nThis, too, was an illusion. As McMaster notes, in fact, \"autocracy was making a comeback.\" It was underlined by the election in 2000 of a hitherto obscure former KGB officer as Russian president -- Vladimir Putin (who has recently pushed through constitutional changes so he can continue ruling Russia until 2036).\\nMcMaster doesn\\'t share Trump\\'s admiration for Putin. McMaster, who is fond of alliteration when it comes to describing enemy tactics, says that Putin uses \"disinformation, denial, dependence and disruptive technologies\" in order to reclaim Russia\\'s \"lost honor\" after the collapse of the once-mighty Soviet Union.\\nIn particular, Putin seems to want to drive a wedge between the United States and NATO. Trump appears to be playing along with Putin\\'s strategy with his regular attacks on NATO, his denigration of key allies such as Canada and Germany, and his cozying up to Putin, none of which makes any strategic sense. \\nMcMaster makes the good point that Trump is far from the only American president who thought they could do business with Putin. George W. Bush famously looked into Putin\\'s soul as if he were some kind of kindred spirit. Hillary Clinton, when she was Obama\\'s secretary of state, pursued a \"reset\" with Russia.\\nBut this was all before Putin set out to subvert the bedrock American principle of free and fair elections, according to the intelligence community. McMaster ignores Trumpian orthodoxy when he notes that \"Russian disinformation showed a clear preference for Trump\" during the 2016 US presidential election.\\nChina\\n \\nIt is China, not Russia, that McMaster says presents the \"larger, more complicated threat to the United States,\" a conclusion that will not surprise anyone familiar with Trump\\'s 2017 national security strategy, written by McMaster and his national security team. \\n \\nThat strategy document made the case that the Chinese steal US intellectual property every year valued at \"hundreds of billions of dollars\" and are \"building the most capable and well-funded military in the world, after our own,\" and warned that Chinese \"land reclamation projects and militarization of the South China Seas flouts international law, threatens the free flow of trade, and undermines stability.\" \\n \\nMcMaster alliteratively asserts that China pursues a strategy of \"co-option, coercion and concealment\" as it seeks to collapse \"the free, open, and rules-based order that the United States and its allies established after World War II.\" \\n \\nThe ruling Communist Party, he contends, is using the Chinese telecom giant Huawei to \"control global communications infrastructure and the data it carries\" in particular for 5G networks and it \"surpassed Cisco as the world\\'s most valuable telecommunications company after it stole the latter\\'s source code.\"  In August, the Trump administration barred Huawei all access to US technology. Huawei has repeatedly denied that it enables Chinese spying. \\n \\nInterestingly, given the Trump administration\\'s stance on immigration, McMaster suggests that a useful response to Chinese authoritarianism is to expose more Chinese to living in a free society and to actually increase immigration from China into the US, \"issuing more visas and providing paths to citizenship for more Chinese, especially those of who have been oppressed at home.\" \\n \\nThe Longest War\\n \\nMcMaster spent two years in Afghanistan running an anti-corruption task force and he has pronounced, well-informed views about what to do about America\\'s longest war. (Disclosure: Before the publication of \"Battlegrounds\" McMaster asked me to comment on a draft of the chapter about Afghanistan and I offered some minor observations.)\\n \\nMcMaster characterizes US officials involved in negotiations with the Taliban under both presidents Obama and Trump as exhibiting an \"extreme case of strategic narcissism based in wishful thinking and a false premise that the Taliban was disconnected from terrorist organizations and open to a power-sharing agreement consistent with the Afghan Constitution.\"\\n \\nAmen to that. US officials negotiate with the Taliban as if they are just a bunch of misunderstood backwoodsmen and a de facto government-in-waiting and so they have to gloss over some important facts, such as the Taliban\\'s dismal record on women\\'s rights and human rights in general and their hosting of al-Qaeda when they were actually in power before 9/11. \\n \\nMcMaster points out that this wishful thinking persists despite the fact that the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al Zawahiri, pledged allegiance to Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansour, the leader of the Taliban in 2015 once it became clear that the original leader of the Taliban, Mullah Omar, had died two years earlier. \\n \\nSimilarly, documents found in bin Laden\\'s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, after he was killed by US Navy SEALs in 2011, underline that bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders continued to be in touch with leaders of the Taliban, including Mullah Omar almost a decade after 9/11.\\n \\nAlso, as McMaster documents, Afghanistan has moved on from the Taliban era in myriad ways. In 2001 there were fewer than one million children in Afghan schools. while the UN estimates that as of 2017 there were almost 10 million children in schools. Where once there had only been the Taliban-controlled Radio Shariat, there are now many hundreds of TV, radio channels and print outlets around the country.  \\n \\nWhen McMaster was Trump\\'s national security adviser, he was able to persuade Trump that a long-term public commitment to Afghanistan and the addition of 4,000 US troops, a relatively small number, to the around 10,000 troops already in Afghanistan, would help to secure American interests there. \\n \\nMcMaster would expend much political capital advocating for this Afghan policy, which the President intensely disliked. A White House staffer told me for my book \"Trump and His Generals\" that McMaster \"got shot in the face for articulating views that other people also held but were not articulating.\"\\n \\nDeparture from Trump orbit\\n McMaster\\'s departure from the White House was sealed when he spoke at the Munich Security Conference in February 2018. McMaster told the Munich audience that the recent indictment in the United States of 13 Russian officials for meddling in the 2016 presidential election showed it was \"now incontrovertible\" that Russia had interfered in it.\\nTrump quickly tweeted, \"General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!\" \\nOnce Trump started publicly contradicting his top aides, they were generally toast. McMaster had wanted to stay on as national security adviser until August 2018, but it was now clear that this wasn\\'t going to happen. On the lovely, sunny afternoon of April 6, 2018, McMaster was \"clapped out\" of the White House by hundreds of cheering staffers. This was a far from routine send-off for senior Trump officials who had been pushed out, many of whom had simply slunk away without any celebration of their service.\\n \\nOnce McMaster left the White House, the Afghan policy was reversed. Trump is planning to draw down US troop levels to as low as 4,000 in Afghanistan by Election Day in the US. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has continued negotiating a \"deal with the Taliban for the purpose of withdrawing from America\\'s longest war,\" which McMaster says is likely to have a \"far worse\" outcome \"than a sustained commitment\" to Afghanistan. \\n \\nIsolationists and internationalists have long debated America\\'s proper role in the world ever since President John Quincy Adams famously declared \"America ... goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy.\" McMaster makes a convincing and comprehensive case for continued US engagement with the world underlined by the emergence of the novel coronavirus in 2020 which he says requires \"international cooperation on health.\"\\n \\nTrump never seemed to really warm to McMaster, who had spent his entire adult life in public service since entering West Point aged 17, unlike Trump who had famously avoided military service during Vietnam and until he had become president had held no public office. McMaster was also a war hero in both the Gulf War and the Iraq War and is too modest to mention in his own memoir that he earned a Silver Star for bravery and was wounded in action.   \\n \\nAlong the way, McMaster also earned a PhD in history which became the basis for his bestselling book \"Dereliction of Duty,\" one of the most influential studies of the US military\\'s conduct of the Vietnam War. McMaster\\'s erudition and scholarship are evident in \"Battlegrounds,\" which comes with more than 75 pages of notes and selected bibliography.  \\nIn \"Trump and His Generals\" I reported that Bannon had warned McMaster before he took the job as national security adviser, \"Whatever you do don\\'t be professorial. Trump is a game-day player. Trump is a guy who never went to class. Never got the syllabus. Never bought a book. Never took a note. He basically comes in the night before the final exams after partying all night, puts on a pot of coffee, takes your notes, memorizes what he\\'s got to memorize. Walks in at eight o\\'clock in the morning and gets whatever grade he needs. That\\'s the reason he doesn\\'t like professors. He doesn\\'t like being lectured to.\"\\nMcMaster largely ignored this advice. He didn\\'t go to Mar-a-Lago regularly with the President, which meant that he had less face time with Trump than those who did go. Where other senior officials put a premium on presidential face time, McMaster put a premium on making sure that he had closely vetted the papers that were circulated to other cabinet members and their staffs. He was a grind while those who connected with Trump were generally schmoozers.\\nMcMaster is, in short, a lot of things President Trump is not. But in \"Battlegrounds,\" he highlights only his policy disagreements with the President and never any kind of personal animus. It\\'s a stance that Trump must find hard to get his head around since for Trump politics and policy are always personal, as is everything else.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)In their fight against the coronavirus, some governments are introducing digital surveillance and data collection tools that could pose a lasting threat to citizens\\' rights, according to a new report by research institute Freedom House. \\nThe Freedom on the Net 2020 report, an assessment of 65 countries released Wednesday, found that the pandemic has accelerated a decline in free speech and privacy on the internet for the tenth consecutive year, and accused some governments of using the virus as a pretext to crack down on critical speech.\\n\"The pandemic is accelerating society\\'s reliance on digital technologies at a time when the internet is becoming less and less free,\" said Michael J. Abramowitz, president of Freedom House, which is funded by the US government. \"Without adequate safeguards for privacy and the rule of law, these technologies can be easily repurposed for political repression.\" \\nAmid the pandemic, internet connectivity has become a lifeline to essential information and services -- from education platforms, to health care portals, employment opportunities and social interactions. But state and nonstate actors are also exploiting the crisis to erode freedoms online.\\nNowhere has that approach been more apparent than in China, according to Freedom House, which rated the country worst for internet freedom for a sixth year in a row.\\nSince the coronavirus outbreak emerged in Wuhan last December, China has deployed every tool in its internet control arsenal -- from digital surveillance, to automated censorship, and systematic arrests -- to stem the spread, not only of Covid-19, but of unofficial information and criticism of the government, researchers found. \\nThese practices are not unique to China, the report details.\\nCensoring the coronavirus outbreak\\nIntent on downplaying unfavorable Covid-19 coverage, authorities censored independent reporting in at least 28 countries and arrested online critics in 45 countries, per the report.  \\nFollowing China\\'s lead, governments from Bangladesh to Belarus blocked reporting and websites that contradicted official sources, revoking credentials and detaining journalists who challenged their statistics. In Venezuela, for example, the government barred a website with information about Covid-19 created by the opposition, while journalists were detained and forced to delete online content about the virus\\' spread in hospitals. \\nThough misinformation about the coronavirus is a pandemic of its own, Freedom House says that at least 20 countries including Thailand, the Philippines and Azerbaijan imposed excessively broad restrictions on speech, many of them new or expanded laws policing \"false\" information, according to the report. In one of the most draconian cases, Zimbabwe passed an emergency provision penalizing \"false\" information about Covid-19, which could put offenders at risk of up to 20 years in prison. \\nAllie Funk, a senior research analyst for technology and democracy at Freedom House, who co-authored the report, said that the long-term impact of these laws will be devastating for free speech, pointing to the self-censorship and climate of fear that they create.\\n\"People may be less likely to report on certain issues because they don\\'t want to face criminal penalties or they don\\'t want to face targeted harassment or violence from pro-government supporters online,\" Funk said.\\nAt least 13 countries went a step further, imposing internet shutdowns that kept populations entirely in the dark. Longterm connectivity restrictions effecting internet and phone services in Ethiopia, Myanmar and Bangladesh, for example, severely limited residents\\' ability to learn about the virus or obtain life-saving information about its spread. \\nSurveillance in the name of public health\\nTracking the spread of the coronavirus is key to limiting further infections -- a tactic that has been credited for South Korea\\'s low number of Covid-19 deaths, for example. But without robust privacy protections, Freedom House warns that some technological responses to the pandemic could pave the way toward future surveillance states.\\nIn at least 30 countries, governments have invoked the pandemic to tap into telecommunications data for mass surveillance with little oversight, Freedom House said. In Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nigeria, among other places, that work is being carried out by or in tandem with national security and military agencies.\\nSmartphone apps for contact tracing, enforcing quarantines and monitoring someone\\'s health status, have been introduced in at least 54 countries, with few privacy protections, according to the report. In China, for example, dozens of health code and contact tracing apps collect personal data that authorities can easily access. While in Singapore, migrant workers who already face discrimination are required to use apps, distinguishing them from other residents. \\nThough contact tracing plays a vital role in containing the virus, some digital monitoring tools are being rolled out hastily and with little accountability for how personal data -- like location, names and contact lists -- might be matched with public information to dangerous effect. And that could prove to be a slippery slope, Freedom House warns.  \\n\"History has shown that technologies and laws adopted during a crisis tend to stick around,\" said Adrian Shahbaz, director for technology and democracy and a co-author of the report. \"As with 9/11, we will look back on COVID-19 as a moment when governments gained new, intrusive powers to control their populations.\"  \\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': ' (CNN)India is in crisis. Its economy has crashed, with the largest slump on record decimating millions of jobs. Its already fragile healthcare system is struggling. With more than five million cases, India ranks only behind the United States for confirmed infections. \\nBut whereas other populist leaders are feeling the political heat from their handling of the pandemic -- US President\\xa0Donald Trump\\xa0and his British counterpart\\xa0Boris Johnson, for instance -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has largely escaped the scathing headlines and crushing opinion polls that have beleaguered his counterparts.   \\nModi\\'s landslide re-election for a second five-year term last year gave him a sweeping mandate to push his Hindu nationalist agenda, in a country where 80% of the population is Hindu. Asim Ali, a researcher at the Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research think-tank, said the Indian leader is seen as a \"national messiah\" who is working on a grander agenda to reshape the Indian nation and is not accountable for day-to-day government failures.\\n\"Modi has staked out for himself the role of not just the political leader of India, but also its social, moral and spiritual leader, in the mold of Mahatma Gandhi,\" Ali said.\\nOver the past year, Modi has made steady headway on Hindu nationalist policies, from revoking the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir, India\\'s only Muslim-majority state, to backing a controversial citizenship law that critics say discriminates against Muslims. \\nBut his second-term aspirations to revitalize the economy now seem more distant than ever due to the pandemic. As it continues to batter the Indian economy, analysts say it\\'s unclear if the populist leader can emerge politically unscathed.\\nThe facts\\nCompared with other world leaders, like Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro -- who downplayed the threat of the pandemic and dismissed the coronavirus as a \"little flu\" only to be infected later himself -- Modi took the coronavirus seriously from the beginning and acted swiftly. \\nWhen he ordered a nationwide lockdown on March 24, the country of 1.36 billion had reported just over 500 coronavirus cases and 10 deaths. \\n\"You have seen how the most powerful nations have become helpless in the face of this pandemic,\" Modi said in a live televised address to the nation, as he announced the lockdown, warning that India could be set back decades if the outbreak was not dealt with properly.\\n\"There is no other way to remain safe from coronavirus ... we have to break the cycle of infection,\" he said.\\nBy taking drastic action early, Modi reaffirmed his image as a decisive leader who is able to take strict, politically tough measures for the sake of the country, said Ali, the researcher at the Center Policy Research.\\nHe is seen as a \"saintly figure who means well and always acts in the larger national interest,\" said Ali. \\nIndian public health experts, however, have differed on their support for the timing and effectiveness of the lockdown. Ramanan Laxminarayan, a senior research scholar at Princeton University, said it was essential because infections were increasing rapidly at the time, and that it helped decrease disease transmission.\\nOthers, including virologist T. Jacob John, argue the lockdown was imposed too early and too widely, when cases were still low and concentrated in specific regions. Consequently, more people were impacted by the resultant economic slowdown than needed to be, and not enough resources were available to support slum areas, for example, where lockdown measures including social distancing were impossible. \\nThe unsustainable nature of the nationwide lockdown merely delayed the spread of the outbreak.\\n\"Now, looking back it was clearly a mistake. We should have waited for longer. Because we didn\\'t stop the pandemic,\" said economist and Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee. \\nWhat most experts agree on is that India\\'s lockdown -- the largest and one of the strictest in the world -- was imposed with not enough notice or planning. Coming into effect less than four hours after it was announced, the measures brought the country to a virtual standstill and triggered a migrant crisis. \\nIn the cities, poor day laborers were suddenly jobless. Many had no choice but to return to their home villages, but with trains and public transport suspended, some walked for hundreds of miles.\\n\"A few days of advance notice would not have hurt the lockdown, but would\\'ve helped small traders plan their stocks, helped people get to places where they could be prepared to stay for a longer period of time, and big companies to shift to alternative ways of working,\" said Laxminarayan.\\n\"What\\'s the point of surviving Covid-19 only to die of starvation or to be stranded without work?\" he said.\\nAccording to the World Bank, a large proportion of India\\'s 40 million internal migrants were affected by the lockdown.\\nIndia\\'s Labour Ministry says there is no state-wide data available on deaths of migrant workers during the lockdown.\\nNo real opposition\\nModi\\'s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has insisted the lockdown was effective and necessary. \"Had we not announced the lockdown when we did, the numbers would have been very different today,\" said BJP\\'s national spokesperson, Syed Zafar Islam. \\nIndia\\'s Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said Monday the lockdown was a \"bold\" decision that had prevented as many as 78,000 deaths.\\n\"It has been estimated that this decision prevented approximately ... 37,000 to 78,000 deaths,\" the minister said. \\nThe BJP\\'s landslide victory in the national elections last year left the biggest opposition party, the Indian National Congress, dispirited and gripped by an unending leadership crisis, as well as rebellions from within. Due to a weak, fragmented opposition, Modi hasn\\'t faced concerted criticism, analysts said. \\nPolitical observers also pointed to the lack of critical coverage from India\\'s media.\\n\"Television news stations rarely cover India\\'s crumbling health infrastructure in the face of the fast spreading pandemic,\" Ali said. \"For weeks, India\\'s most watched television networks have been obsessively focused on a Bollywood actor\\'s suicide even as India became (a) leading global hotspot of the pandemic.\"\\nUnlike other democratic leaders, Modi rarely gives press conferences. Interactions with the media are usually left to his government ministers. \\nInstead, he addresses the nation directly on live television and radio, making emotional appeals to the public to follow his lead. \\n\"I am well aware of the problems you have faced -- some for food, some for movement from place to place, and others for staying away from homes and families,\" he said in a speech in April, as he extended the lockdown.\\n\"However, for the sake of your country, you are fulfilling your duties like a disciplined soldier. This is the power of \\'We, the People of India\\' that our constitution talks about.\"\\nCompared to his predecessors, Modi has made a much bigger effort to speak directly to ordinary Indians. On the last Sunday of every month, he hosts a radio program called \"Mann Ki Baat\" -- or \"inner thoughts\" -- which usually touches on cultural issues.\\nSome migrant workers who lost their livelihood in the lockdown have refused to blame Modi for their predicament.\\nSubhash Das had been working as a driver in a city southwest of New Delhi for 10 years when he was sacked less than a month into the lockdown. He had no choice but to return to his home village in eastern India, and has been struggling to provide for his family.\\nHe said the lockdown was necessary and helped to control the outbreak, even though it had upended his life.\\n\"I don\\'t blame the Prime Minister for my situation. It\\'s due to coronavirus that people like me are suffering,\" he said. \"I love Modi. He\\'s done so much for my village. He\\'s provided (us) electricity and concrete homes.\"\\nRitika Oberoi, who lost her job as a senior manager at a travel agency in May when the company went out of business, also doesn\\'t hold Modi responsible either. \\'\\'It\\'s Covid-19 that hit the travel industry severely,\" she said.\\nWhen the restrictions were lifted in late May, infections started to increase at an exponential rate. It took five-and-a-half months for India to record 1 million cases on July 17. Then, it took another three weeks to hit 2 million, 16 days to reach 3 million, and only 12 days to pass 4 million in early September before arriving at 5 million on Wednesday.\\nLaxminarayan, the public health expert at Princeton University, said it was never possible for India to contain the epidemic due to its underfunded health system, high population density and lack of public health awareness.  \\n\"Social distancing is a luxury that was simply never available to most Indians,\" he said. \"At this point the epidemic is uncontrolled and will run through the Indian population until we reach some semblance of population immunity.\"\\nThe economic fallout \\nWhile some Indians may not blame Modi for the escalating coronavirus outbreak, experts warned that the economic fallout of the pandemic could eventually cost Modi politically.\\n\"Modi has consistently presented himself to the Indian electorate as a \\'development messiah,\\' who will somehow transform India through his leadership from a low income developing country to some kind of a socially and economically advanced country,\" said Sumantra Bose, a political scientist at the London School of Economics.\\n\"He\\'s been selling this dream for the past 6 years. However ... that makes him vulnerable to a really serious downturn in the economy.\"\\nWhen Modi was first elected in 2014, he promised to overhaul India\\'s economy and create millions of jobs for young people.\\nWhen he sought a second term, he set the bar even higher -- in its election manifesto, the BJP envisaged to turn India into the world\\'s third largest economy by 2032, with a size of $10 trillion.  \\nWeeks after assuming office, the Modi government pledged to turn India into a 5-trillion-dollar economy in five years. By some economists\\' estimate, that would require the Indian economy to grow on an average of 9% per year.  \\nBut even before the pandemic, the Indian economy was already faltering.  \\nIn the past three months of 2019, GDP growth dropped to 4.7%, its slowest rate in more than six years. \\nSome of the greatest economic damage was caused by some of Modi\\'s signature policies. In November 2016, he abruptly banned the two biggest banknotes in circulation, making 86% of the country\\'s cash worthless. \\nWhile the aim was to crack down on black money and tax evasion -- which many experts said was misguided, given that most untaxed wealth is not believed to be stored in cash -- the move wreaked havoc on the cash-dependent economy and brought several sectors to a halt.\\nAnd now, the coronavirus lockdown has plunged India into a historic recession. \\nAs businesses, factories and construction sites ground to a halt, India\\'s economy contracted by 24% from April to June, the worst slump since 1996, when the country started reporting quarterly data. In April alone, an estimated 122 million Indians lost their jobs, although the number narrowed down to 11 million in July, according to the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE), an independent think tank.\\nAccording to a World Bank report in July, around half of India\\'s population is at risk of slipping back into poverty due to income and job losses. \\nIn May, Modi\\'s government announced a $260 billion relief package to prop up the ailing economy during the pandemic, but economists say too little of it was given to the poor, who have been hit hardest. \\nThis week, global rating agency Moody\\'s projected India\\'s economy would contract 11.5% this financial year, down from the 4% forecast in July, citing the severe impact of the lockdown and the continued surge in coronavirus cases.\\nHindu nationalism\\nWith the economy in tatters, Modi has continued to pursue the Hindu nationalist agenda which helped him win a second term. But critics have warned that it could further polarize Hindus and Muslims -- the latter have already been subject to vigilante attacks in recent years.\\nDuring the pandemic, some of India\\'s 200 million Muslims have been targeted in Islamophobic attacks on the streets and online, and have been accused of spreading the virus, after a conservative Muslim group was linked to a highly publicized cluster of coronavirus cases in March.\\nWhile these incidents have been mostly isolated, the virus seems to be amplifying existing prejudices, playing into growing Hindu nationalism which in recent years has seen India\\'s Muslim societies increasingly marginalized.\\nLast month, amid rising coronavirus cases, Modi attended a ground-breaking ceremony for a Hindu temple at the site of a demolished 16th-century mosque. The holy site at Ayodhya, a town in Uttar Pradesh state, has been at the center of the country\\'s most politically and culturally divisive land dispute. With the temple going into construction, Modi has fulfilled one of his key election promises. \\nBut Bose said Modi\\'s nationalist policies ultimately won\\'t be enough to distract people from the reality of the economic crisis for long. Many Indians are simply too confused and worried about the pandemic and their livelihoods to express their political outrage right now -- put simply, their disenchantment hasn\\'t manifested itself, he said.\\n\"The unraveling of the Modi aura has begun, it\\'s perhaps not manifest yet, but it\\'s there,\" he said. \"People are not really thinking about Modi or party politics, or the next election right now. In that sense, it\\'s really in a way premature to say that Modi\\'s standing is unaffected.\" \\nIndia\\'s next general election is still four years away in 2024, and there are no term limits for the position of prime minister in the constitution.\\nBut Modi and his BJP will soon face a litmus test on their popular support -- the upcoming legislative assembly elections in the eastern state of Bihar, home to millions of migrant workers who were deeply affected by the lockdown and economic nosedive. \\nThe Bihar elections, scheduled to be held in October, could serve as a microcosm referendum on the Modi government\\'s handling of the coronavirus outbreak and the economy.\\n\"The states are the building blocks of the national politics,\" Bose said. \"The outcome of that election will be a reliable barometer.\"\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': '\\nNorth Aegean Sea  —  The warm glow of a bright orange life raft lights up the pitch black night. A small hand opens the floating tent, revealing 11 people who stare wide-eyed at an approaching Turkish coast guard rescue mission.\\nA young girl clutches a doll as she climbs out of the motorless boat onto the Turkish ship. The rest of the group are pulled up to the deck.\\n\"You really don\\'t want to know what they\\'ve done to us,\" said Fatima Dhaiwi, looking over at her two daughters huddled under blankets. \"Definitely, definitely not going again.\"\\nDhaiwi and the rest of the people on the ship tell CNN that they were forced back to sea by \"masked men\" after they arrived on Greek shores. Other migrants have also told CNN in recent weeks that they were pushed back from Greece, an accusation that Athens has repeatedly denied. \\nThe United Nations\\' refugee agency (UNHCR) has also sounded alarms about \"an increasing number of credible reports\" of men, women and children being informally returned to Turkey after arriving on Greek land or waters in recent months.\\nAround 5,000 asylum-seekers have arrived in Greece since the start of March, according to the UNHCR. That figure marks \"a precipitous drop from previous years. Yet, the number of reported pushbacks, particularly at sea, has been rising,\" the agency says. It has called on Greece to investigate the reports.\\nOn September 13, a Turkish coast guard ship granted access to CNN to observe search-and-rescue efforts along the north Aegean Sea. The area accounts for nearly 50% of all sea crossings for migrants and refugees in 2020, according to the Turkish coast guard. \\nSince late February, 6,600 migrants were rescued at sea after being pushed back by Greek forces, according to the Turkish coast guard. They were found by the rescuers in \"punctured plastic dinghies with motors rendered unusable or on unseaworthy life rafts,\" the coast guard said in a statement on September 14. The 11 people taken onboard the previous day are included in that figure. \\nThe Dhaiwi family set off for Turkey from crisis-ridden Lebanon six months ago with hopes of shuttling through Greece and ultimately settling in Germany. This was the family\\'s fifth attempt at seeking temporary refuge in Greece.  \\n\"They grabbed me from my neck and started hitting me,\" said Dhaiwi, describing a confrontation on the Greek island of Lesbos in the north Aegean Sea roughly 12 hours after the family made landfall. \"They put a knife to my husband\\'s stomach and they held a gun to my son\\'s head.\"  \\nCNN cannot confirm the identity or affiliation of the masked men. Lesbos is home to Europe\\'s largest migrant camp, which earlier this month was destroyed by a fire allegedly started by migrants protesting poor living conditions and Covid-19 restrictions in the settlement.\\nSaleh Dhaiwi holds up his hand, pointing at a wound he says was inflicted when he was shoved into the boat. The family members described being searched, and said their money and phones were taken from them. \\nThe Dhaiwis\\' testimony is similar to that of others on the boat. Ayat Abdi Ibrahim from Somalia said a group of men rounded up the migrants, breaking her spectacles and confiscating her medicines. \\n\"Even animals are not treated like this,\" said Ibrahim. \"I didn\\'t want anything from them, no money, nothing, I just wanted to get to my husband in any way possible.\"\\nHer husband has lived in Italy for five years. After the treatment she received on Lesbos, she says, she will not try to reunite with him again. \\nThe Greek government defends its border policy, suggesting that the Turkish government has orchestrated media reports of pushbacks at sea as part of a disinformation campaign.  \\n\"Greece has every right as every sovereign state to defend its borders, we have a very tough but very fair border policy,\" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told CNN\\'s Christiane Amanpour in August. \"These types of reports are also an insult to our coast guard. The Greek coast guard has saved literally tens of thousands of refugees and migrants at sea.\" \\nBut the UNHCR says it has collected multiple reports of pushbacks at its office in Greece. The UN agency has called for an immediate investigation into the alleged practices. \\n\"Given the nature, content, frequency, and consistency of these accounts, a proper investigation should be launched without further delay,\" the UNHCR report said.\\nIn response to CNN\\'s queries about the alleged events of the night of September 13, the Greek Migration Ministry said it \"always operates in full respect to International Law and European Regulations.\" However, the statement did not acknowledge the incident as described by the migrants and the Turkish coast guard. \\n\"We strongly deny any claims that the Hellenic Coast Guard engages in illegal \\'pushbacks\\' in the Aegean Sea, and we point out that the source, as you mention, of these allegations is the Turkish Coast Guard,\" the Greek migration ministry said in a statement to CNN.\\nCNN has also been in close contact with an Afghan migrant, currently residing in the Turkish coastal city of Izmir, who has attempted multiple crossings into Greece. Hamid Fazli, 23, said he attempted the sea crossing three times this year with his family. During two of those attempts, he says, the Greek coast guard violently pushed them back to Turkish waters.\\nOn May 16, Fazli asked for help from everyone he knew, including CNN. After his rescue at sea, he sent video of their life raft showing the Greek coast guard in the distance. CNN was able to match the video filmed by Fazli to a Turkish coast guard report published on May 20 showing the rescue of a vessel after it was allegedly pushed back at sea while attempting to get to the island of Samos.\\nOn August 16, Fazli, his wife and 18-month-old son were caught by Greek authorities after they arrived on Lesbos along with a group of Somali refugees, he said.  \\nThey say they were searched and all their money and belongings confiscated. Those who tried to resist were beaten up, he said. They were told they would be taken into quarantine, but instead the group was moved onto a ship. They were then pushed onto a small raft and left in the open sea for several hours before being pulled out by the Turkish coast guard, according to Fazli.\\n\"The water was very bad, a lot of waves, very dangerous and they do not see you are human,\" said Fazli. \"They don\\'t give us anything (not) even a bottle of water for my baby.\"\\nCNN first met Fazli and a group of Afghans in March near the land border between Turkey and Greece. At the time, he said they arrived in Greece only to be captured, beaten up and had their belongings removed. Several migrants and refugees from Syria, Morocco, the Palestinian territories and Pakistan described similar incidents of violent pushback into Turkey at the land border. \\nFazli said he will not attempt to seek refuge in Greece again. \"We are not trying to go back because they sent us back like that last time. I wish we can go there, I wish they would accept us.\"\\nEarlier this year, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused the European Union of not fulfilling its obligations under a 2016 deal with his country aimed at stemming the flow of migrants and refugees. Turkey says it was left to shoulder most of the burden of hosting more than 3.5 million refugees on its own. \\nRead more: Greek president visits tiny island at center of eastern Mediterranean dispute, angering Turkey\\nTurkish authorities then loosened border restrictions, a move that the EU criticized, accusing Turkey of exploiting refugees and migrants for political leverage. At the time, the Greek Prime Minister accused Turkey of \"weaponizing the issue.\"\\nBut Greece\\'s alleged pushbacks are a violation of international law as well as European regulations, according to migration experts and rights groups.\\n\"When you push back people at sea, you endanger them and you are not complying with the obligation to have asylum proceedings,\" said Nele Matz-Luck, a professor at Kiel University and co-director of the Walther Schucking Institute for International Law. \"In the end it may be that there is no individual right to refugee status, but in the moment, the pushback operation violates the provisions in international law.\" \\nBack on the rescue boat, curled up in pain, Riham Sheim, a 27-year-old Palestinian-Syrian from the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus, echoes the sentiments of her fellow migrants. \"This was my first and last attempt,\" she said. \\nTo Sheim, who had made a perilous journey from Syria, only the European Union can provide the safe future she seeks. But now she has given up. \"None of God\\'s countries want us,\" she said.\\n\\n'},\n",

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\\n (CNN)President Donald Trump keeps downplaying the coronavirus even after it killed more than a million people around the world and left him hospitalized for three days. He has now claimed Covid-19 is \"in most populations far less lethal!!!\" than the flu. That\\'s not true. Here are the facts.\\nIn just eight months, Covid-19 has killed more Americans than the flu did during the last five flu seasons combined. \\nThe novel coronavirus is also much more contagious than the flu. While research shows that someone with the flu infects an average of about 1.28 other people, someone with Covid-19 infects an average of about 2 to 3 other people when mitigation efforts such as stay-at-home orders or masks are not in place.\\nOn top of that, the coronavirus can be spread for many days without symptoms. The incubation period for the flu is much shorter, meaning people are likely to start feeling sick earlier and avoid contact with others. \\nThere\\'s also a vaccine available for the flu and experts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got flu shots. \\nEven Facebook has pushed back against the claim by removing a post from Trump about the flu, but it\\'s unlikely that will have any effect on the President\\'s approach. His advice to not let the coronavirus \"dominate your life\" has left loved ones of Covid-19 victims furious.\\n\"It not only has dominated the lives of the people we\\'ve lost. It\\'s dominated the families of those people. It\\'s dominated, and it still does, the hospital, the health heroes that were working every day to save my husband, the doctors, and nurses ... it\\'s insulting,\" Amanda Kloots, wife of Broadway star Nick Cordero, told CNN. Cordero fought the virus for 95 days and died. Cordero and Kloots have a 1-year-old son together.\\nYOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED\\nQ. Is it safe to get a flu shot in the fall?\\nA: Yes. And please do so, doctors say.\\nThis year, it\\'s \"more important than ever to get a flu shot because we will almost certainly face the double whammy of flu season coinciding the same time as surging cases of Covid-19,\" emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen said.\\nAnd a flu/coronavirus double whammy could be disastrous if it overwhelms the healthcare system. An estimated 410,000 to 740,000 Americans were hospitalized with the flu this past flu season, from October to April, according to the CDC.\\nWen said the flu shot is about 40% to 60% effective.

After working from home for several days, Miller showed up to work yesterday and tested positive, a source familiar with what happened told CNN. \\nDespite the growing outbreak, the White House has declined offers from the CDC to help investigate the outbreak, according to a federal health official. On top of the White House outbreak, all but one member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are in quarantine after having attended meetings in the Pentagon\\'s secure spaces. \\nTrump abruptly scraps coronavirus stimulus talks\\nPresident Trump has announced an end to new stimulus talks until after the election yesterday. The decision is a major blow to millions of Americans still out of work as well as small businesses and major airlines that are struggling to stay afloat. \\nAnother round of federal funding was seen as vital to propping up the nation\\'s economy at a time when the recovery is weakening. Just hours before Trump\\'s announcement, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated his calls for more fiscal stimulus, saying that \"the risks of overdoing it seem, for now, to be smaller\" than not providing more help.\\nMost patients hospitalized with Covid-19 have neurological symptoms\\nA new study published in the journal Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology said more than four-fifths of Covid‐19 patients hospitalized across nine hospitals in the Chicago area earlier this year have shown neurological symptoms.\\nThe researchers found that overall, 82% of the 509 Covid-19 patients had neurological symptoms at any time during the course of their Covid-19 illness.

       "  'body': 'This weekly column will turn into a CNN newsletter later this year. Tell us what you\\'d like to see more of in the newsletter at newsletter.project@cnn.com.\\n (CNN)This week has been a gut punch. Already reeling from the implications of what the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg means for the future of civil rights in America, we had to sit with the rage over the lack of charges in Breonna Taylor\\'s death.\\nBut there were some moments of hope. Zendaya\\'s moving speech at the Emmys made us proud. Plus, recommendations: Rolling Stone\\'s new list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" and, on Netflix, \"Atlantique.\"\\nCNN legal analyst Joan Biskupic joins this week\\'s culture conversation as we discuss Ginsburg\\'s legacy on race and criminal justice. \\nQ: Often, we hear about Ruth Bader Ginsburg as a feminist icon. Could you tell us a bit about some of the highlights from her career on race? We\\'re thinking of cases like Jackson v. Hobbs and Shelby County v. Holder.\\nBiskupic: Ruth Bader Ginsburg was known for her women\\'s rights emphasis, but in recent years she became the voice of broader civil rights, particularly after she became the senior justice on the left in 2010 and took control in assigning opinions for the liberal wing. Liberals were often in dissent on racial civil rights, and no decision demonstrates that more, or RBG\\'s sentiment more, than the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder.\\nIn that case, the conservative Roberts majority invalidated a section of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of discrimination, mostly in the South, to pre-clear any proposed change in their election rules with federal officials. The majority said that the requirement was outdated and that things had changed in the South.\\n\"Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes,\" Ginsburg responded, joined by her liberal colleagues, \"is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.\"\\nShe cited several examples of contemporary voter discrimination. In the case from Shelby County, Alabama, she highlighted \"Alabama\\'s sorry history\" of voting rights violations and reminded readers that that the state \"is home to Selma, site of the \\'Bloody Sunday\\' beatings of civil-rights demonstrators that served as the catalyst for the VRA\\'s enactment.\" She then quoted Martin Luther King Jr., who had said, \"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\" And Ginsburg concluded: \"History has proven King right. The sad irony of today\\'s decision lies in its utter failure to grasp why the Voting Rights Act has proven effective.\"\\nQ: Where did Ginsburg stand on criminal justice?\\nBiskupic: On criminal cases, Ginsburg\\'s record is mixed. She was not a liberal in the mold of Justices William Brennan (1956-1990) or Thurgood Marshall (1967-1991), who were more inclined to side with criminal defendants against law enforcement and who opposed capital punishment. On today\\'s court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor is more reliably in favor of defendants\\' rights.\\nYet Ginsburg led the left as it voted against some of the Roberts Court\\'s strongest decisions cutting back on criminal-rights milestones of the 1960s and 1970s.\\nOne recent case I will mention, in which RBG wrote alone, relates to concerns about police conduct. The 2018 case, District of Columbia v. Wesby, required the court to revisit its decision in Whren v. United States, which enhanced police power for traffic stops and found an officer\\'s motivation irrelevant when deciding whether a stop or arrest was lawful.\\nIn the 2018 DC v. Wesby case, Justice Ginsburg wrote a solo concurrence saying, \"The Court\\'s jurisprudence, I am concerned, sets the balance too heavily in favor of police unaccountability to the detriment of Fourth Amendment protection. ... I would leave open, for reexamination in a future case, whether a police officer\\'s reason for acting, in at least some circumstances, should factor into the Fourth Amendment inquiry.\"\\nBut I should emphasize that the 1996 Whren was unanimous, and no other justice joined Ginsburg\\'s concurrence in the 2018 Wesby.\\nQ: Any thoughts on what Ginsburg\\'s death might mean for these issues?\\nBiskupic: I do not expect any shift to the left in this area of the law, particularly now that Ginsburg would be succeeded by an appointee of President Donald Trump.\\nFor further reading, check out professor and author Peniel Joseph\\'s take on \"How to remember the \\'Notorious RBG,\\'\" a piece in which he unpacks the justice\\'s Colin Kaepernick comments and the rest of her legacy in the context of today.\\nAround the office\\nFor people across the country, one of this week\\'s defining feelings has been grief and anger.\\nOn Wednesday, more than six months after Breonna Taylor was shot and killed in a flawed police raid, a grand jury indicted only one of the three officers involved on first-degree wanton endangerment charges.\\nIn other words, no officer was charged directly with Taylor\\'s death.\\n\"We lost a beautiful woman in Breonna,\" NBA star LeBron James said on Thursday. \"We want justice no matter how long it takes, even though it\\'s been so many days, so many hours, so many minutes for her family, for her community.\"\\nCNN\\'s Madeline Holcombe, Steve Almasy and Dakin Andone reported on the outrage gripping the country. \\n\"From Louisville to Los Angeles, Atlanta and New York, masses of people congregated to protest the decision. Police in Portland declared protests outside the justice center there a riot,\" our colleagues wrote.\\nAs Sadiqa Reynolds, the president and CEO of the Louisville Urban League, told them, \"We somehow got our hopes up in this case.

       "  'body': ' (CNN)Should Joe Biden win the upcoming US presidential election, his first and overwhelming foreign policy challenge will be winning back the trust of America\\'s allies. With the planet in its most chaotic period since World War II, a steady Biden leadership could potentially reset the world order -- but only with allies\\' help.  \\nEuropean allies in particular will be hoping that if he does become president, Biden swiftly makes a convincing case that President Donald Trump\\'s four years in office were an anti-democratic aberration that can never be repeated. Without such an understanding it will be difficult to convince friendly nations that Biden\\'s own replacement won\\'t renege on deals he makes.\\nBiden committed to this during a speech in New York in July last year promising to \"invite my fellow democratic leaders to put strengthening democracy back on the global agenda.\" But it will take more than words to overcome the uncertainty. \\nQuick confidence-builders could include recommitting the US to the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, from which Trump began formally withdrawing in 2019. Biden promised as much during his New York speech saying, \"I will re-join the Paris Climate Accord and convene a summit of the world\\'s largest carbon emitters, rallying nations to raise their ambitions and push our progress further.\" \\n \\nAlso likely music to his allies\\' ears were Biden\\'s comments at a speech on Covid-19 in Delaware in June this year, saying he\\'ll reverse Trump\\'s decision to cut funding to the World Health Organization (WHO), the only credible international health body. \"It is essential to coordinating the global response during a pandemic, and the United States should be leading that response as we had in the past,\" Biden said.\\nBy committing to a multilateral agenda, Biden would help answer fears the US has turned its back on values that underpin democratic nations as rising global nationalism fuels populist autocracies. Europe in particular wants to see more said in defense of democracies. Speaking before the European Parliament in April 2018 French President Emmanuel Macron, who has personally tried to court and influence Trump, said, \"I want to take the firm choice to defend democracy.\"\\nMacron had in mind the leaders of Hungary and Poland, people Trump befriended early in his presidency as he gave a cold shoulder to Germany\\'s Angela Merkel and bullied Britain\\'s then Prime Minister Theresa May.\\nBiden is no stranger to foreign policy, serving for years as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when he was in Congress, not to mention aiding then-President Obama on policy during eight years as vice president. But since he left office in early 2017, the world has changed.\\nOver four years, Trump\\'s feckless leadership has cost America the support of its friends, blunting the White House\\'s ability to cement strong coalitions behind US positions on Iran, China and North Korea and by implication, weakening America\\'s own national security. \\nMeanwhile, Presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia, Xi Jinping of China, and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, as well as dictator Kim Jong Un of North Korea and others, have exploited Trump\\'s vanity. They have fed his ego, stroked his ambitions while reaping their own gains, many now effectively leaders for life.\\n \\nToday, Brexit is nearly a reality, migrants and nationalism have become a more toxic political brew in part fanned by Trump\\'s support of populist politicians.\\nBiden appeared to address those changes and Trump\\'s apathy toward traditional democratic US alliances in an op-ed published in \"Foreign Affairs\" earlier this year, where he argued that \"working cooperatively with other nations that share our values and goals does not make the United States a chump. It makes us more secure and more successful.\"\\nBut in this new landscape, there will be no simple reset for Biden. If he makes it into the Oval Office, he will need to act with unambiguous certainty to \"place America back at the head of the table,\" as he put it during his July speech in New York, and time will not be his friend. In January, a disgruntled Trump base, Covid-19 and economic challenges could monopolize his first days in office.\\nThis means that Biden\\'s foreign policy plans will need to be ready to go and entrusted from day one to an experienced diplomat, capable of leading a State Department left eviscerated by firings, resignations and a hiring freeze during the Trump administration.\\nAlies will be invaluable\\nAs the clock ticks down on the election, new problems are also brewing.\\nRussia\\'s Putin, who ran rings around Trump on Syria, appears to be eyeing an intervention in Belarus. In the Mediterranean, Turkey\\'s increasingly authoritarian Erdogan may be on a collision course with Greece over oil and gas. On both developing issues, NATO, often derided by Trump, will be front and center. \\nThe Middle East will be a challenging environment for a President Biden to win friends. The Obama administration let long-standing allies there fall during the Arab Spring, and over the past four years, Gulf state leaders have appreciated Trump\\'s hard line on Iran, eagerness to sell arms, and disinterest in human rights issues.\\nBut it is in China that the next president will face a defining foreign policy challenge -- and where understanding allies will be most indispensable. Chinese President Xi has perhaps more at stake with a Biden presidency than any other world leader.  For Xi, the next US president will stand between China and the road to dominant superpower status.\\n \\nAmerica\\'s allies backed Trump for taking on China\\'s abusive trade practices, intellectual property theft, and forced technology transfer -- but then Trump left them flapping in the chill uncertain wind of an economic trade war, where they had no say.\\nBiden agrees with Trump\\'s trade complaints, but not his methods, telling the crowd in New York last year that he would also be tough on China, by building \"a united front of friends and partners to challenge China\\'s abusive behavior,\" rather than taking unilateral actions.\\nXi has responded to Trump\\'s pressure ratcheting up regional tensions with a muscular foreign policy becoming increasingly assertive, effectively taking control of Hong Kong, stepping up military exercises near Taiwan, militarizing Islands in the South China Sea as well as confronting Japan over islands in the East China Sea.\\nIf Biden is to be tested, as Kennedy was by Soviets in 1962 during the Cuban Missiles Crisis, it will come this time, not from Moscow, but at the hand of Beijing.\\nThe more allies America has, the less likely such a challenge could materialize.\\n\\n'},\n",

Yet other than attracting an inordinately good lineup of players -- many in relatively minor roles -- the dutiful nature of the adaptation drains much of the life out of the movie.\\nSimply put, \"The Devil All the Time\" has the texture of a Coen brothers film, with a dash of \"L.A. Confidential\" in terms of the music and period. But despite its vivid rendition of the era and a small town with secrets like Knockemstiff, Ohio, it lacks the wit of those movies, and shifts around so much it\\'s easy to become restless waiting for the lines to intersect.\\nIndeed, those drawn by the aforementioned super-stars should be forewarned neither appears till more of a third of the way through the movie, which begins in 1957, flashes back to a soldier returning home from World War II and, before it\\'s over, jumps ahead to the days of escalation in Vietnam, encompassing a roughly 20-year span.\\nCovering that kind of ground presents a daunting task, one that might have fared better stretched into a limited series. As is, the film essentially lurches from one character to the next, in a way that feels unavoidably episodic, and leaves some talented players -- Haley Bennett and Mia Wasikowska among them -- with little to do.\\nThe early portion tilts toward the aforementioned soldier (Bill Skarsgard), whose grown-up son Arvin (Holland) winds up being raised along with a young girl (Eliza Scanlen) who has survived a separate tragedy.\\nElsewhere, there\\'s a serial-killer couple (Jason Clarke and Riley Keough), who pick up hitchhikers and murder them; a corrupt sheriff (Sebastian Stan, another refugee from the Marvel universe), trying to get reelected; and a lascivious preacher (Pattinson), who shows up almost an hour into the movie, spouting sermons that merely illustrate his hypocrisy.\\nArvin\\'s dad didn\\'t teach him much, but he did espouse justice in the form of vengeance. The character certainly offers a different side of Holland, who is among the few afforded any significant screen time to exhibit much in the way of compassion or humanity.\\nOf course, just assembling this cast represents a promotional coup for Netflix, likely to land the movie on its most-popular list, amid a push that involves scheduling high-profile features each week at a time when the theatrical business remains hobbled.\\nFeeling compelled (or at least motivated) to watch, however, isn\\'t the same thing as liking it.

       "  'body': 'David Miliband is president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian relief organization. He is a former Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom. The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\\n (CNN)Before the start of the new fiscal year on October 1, President Donald Trump was legally bound to decide how many of the world\\'s 26 million refugees will be offered one of the prized and rare places in America\\'s refugee resettlement program. For refugees admitted, the program is their chance to begin their lives anew. And for America it is an opportunity to live out its commitment to be a beacon to the world\\'s most vulnerable and persecuted. \\nUS decisions in this area have led the world -- for better and for worse -- and there is no shortage of deserving cases of people fleeing persecution, from Syria to Hong Kong to El Salvador. However, last Wednesday\\'s White House submission to Congress proposed a refugee cap of an all-time low of 15,000. President Trump has yet to sign this new Presidential Determination on Refugee Admissions into law. \\nWith the largest refugee crisis in history underway, refugee admissions to the US have been slashed by the Trump administration over the last four years by 80%. The historic average for refugee admissions under both Republican and Democratic presidents since 1980 is 95,000 refugees per year. The Trump administration set the admissions goal last year at a historic low of 18,000 and has admitted just over 11,000. A cap of just 15,000 for fiscal year 2021 can only mean a further decline in US leadership.\\nLast year, the administration took the controversial step of doing away with priorities based on regions with the greatest need and created four new categories for refugee admissions: refugees fleeing religious persecution; Iraqis whose lives are in danger because they supported US missions abroad; refugees from Northern Central America, and refugees meeting various criteria under an umbrella \"Other\" category.  Since then the administration has made additional commitments to provide safety to those fleeing political persecution in Hong Kong. \\nThe administration has largely abdicated these commitments. Though 5,000 slots were allotted for those fleeing religious persecution last year, these people have been left out in the cold on a global scale. World Relief found that the admission of Christian refugees from Iran, Iraq, and Myanmar—countries where Christians often face severe persecution on the basis of their faith—is on track to decline 97%, 95% and 94%, respectively, between 2015 and the end of this fiscal year. \\nFurther, the category for refugees from Northern Central America sits at just 42% of the 1,500 allocation. look to be even more restrictive, leaving refugees especially from some of the worst crises in Africa shut out, with thousands awaiting admission. This year\\'s categories look to be even more restrictive, leaving refugees especially from some of the worst crises in Africa shut out, with thousands awaiting admission. \\nDespite 4,000 slots reserved for Iraqis persecuted due to their wartime service alongside US troops last year, the New York Times reported that just 153 of these allies were admitted in 2019, and 123 in 2020. This meager showing of commitment to the estimated 110,000 Iraqis awaiting approval threatens US credibility with partners and potentially undermines military and intelligence operations abroad.  \\nMeanwhile, with the ongoing slashing of admissions and new categorization, the door has been shut on refugees fleeing from some of the most harrowing crises worldwide. With the Syrian crisis in its tenth year, its refugees account for an overwhelming 41% of all people in need of resettlement globally. Yet admissions of Syrians have plummeted by 96% under the Trump administration. \\nAmong a total 30,000 people resettled in fiscal year 2019, there were just 563 Syrians, and a mere 442 in fiscal year 2020. With a record-breaking 80 million refugees and displaced people announced this year, the administration must return to admitting refugees based on regions of global need.\\nAlthough the administration has set a lower number, it can still do right by accelerating the pace of arrivals, with the President signing a determination immediately, and arrivals resuming imminently with any administrative hurdles removed. Last year, President Trump delayed signing this decision by a full month. As a result, there were almost 8,000 travel-ready refugees left in precarious and uncertain limbo. With more than 500 flights repeatedly canceled and rebooked -- some four times over -- US taxpayers also bore the cost. With their lives on the line, these people cannot afford such a cavalier approach.\\n\\n'},\n",

I feel like something might happen and I might find myself where I was yesterday.\" \\nFor a person in his mid-twenties, Mayen does not have the typical upbringing one would imagine for a modern-day video game designer. He grew up in a place where every day was a struggle for survival.\\nMayen is a refugee from South Sudan who was born in the midst of his family\\'s search for safety.\\n\"It was not an easy journey for my family. They were seeing their belongings being taken, people being killed on the way. Sometimes there was no food, no water to drink. During the journey, I lost two of my sisters.\"\\nAs a newborn, Mayen and his family made it to a refugee camp in Northern Uganda. He ended up living there for over 22 years.  \\n\"One of the things that a lot of people think about a refugee camp is that refugees go there and live there for a few years,\" said Mayen. \"But it became a really permanent home for us.\" \\nLife in the refugee camp was hard for Mayen and his family. There was no school, food wasn\\'t always available and as Mayen says, \"All you do is try to survive.\" \\nAs a boy, he remembers watching his friend fall to his death while trying to get something to eat from a mango tree. Yet two days later, pushed by hunger, Mayen returned to the tree in search of food.\\nCharging towards change\\nIt wasn\\'t until 2007, when Mayen was around 15 years old, that he saw something that would change his life.\\n\"I first saw a computer in 2007 at a refugee registration,\" said Mayen, \"and I was like, \\'Wow, what is that?\\'\"\\nMayen asked his mother for a computer. But the family had very little money, so he soon forgot about his request. For the next three years, however, his mother worked, secretly saving up $300 to surprise her son so he could buy a computer. \\n\"I couldn\\'t believe that it was real. And then I was like, \\'So what can I do? Where can I even charge the computer? Where can I even go and learn?\\' Because there was nobody that could train me.\"\\n\"I asked myself, If my mother can save $300 for three years to be able to buy a computer, \\'How about me?\\' If she was able to take us from a war-torn country to an environment of a refugee, I can also make it. It inspired me so much to start looking for ways to be able to utilize the product that my mother got for me.\"\\nThe nearest spot for Mayen to charge his computer was a UN basecamp three hour\\'s walk from his camp. The trek became a daily ritual: walk three hours to the basecamp, charge his computer and download tutorials to teach himself how to use it, then walk three hours back.\\nDuring one of his computer charging trips, a friend of Mayen\\'s introduced him to a new virtual pastime -- the video game. \\n\"I came back home, I opened my laptop and the first thing I saw was the icon for \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.\" I opened it and I was like, \\'Wow, what is this?\\'\" \\nIt was the first time he ever played a video game.\\nThe game\\'s story and play involves violent situations, including scenes where characters must run for their lives. For Mayen and many refugees, it was something they had actually lived through. Playing the game made him wonder about the possibilities of video games.\\n\"If kids in my country start playing this game, they will feel like that\\'s how things are done. But I realized games are so powerful. When you\\'re playing a game, you\\'re actually putting yourself in the shoes of somebody,\" said Mayen. \\nThat inspired him to ask himself: How could he create a video game for peace and conflict resolution?\\nFueled by that question, Mayen began his mission to teach himself through tutorials how to code, design and create his own video game from scratch. Within six months, he had a basic version of a game that he could share with other people in the refugee community over Bluetooth. But once he realized that he could reach more people by posting his game on Facebook, it took off.\\n\"People starting downloading the game and started sharing it. That was the first time I started connecting with the video game community and getting support.\"\\nMayen was invited to South Africa to speak with other game designers and industry insiders about how he made a game from his refugee camp, a game that promotes peace. Then from there he was invited to the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco.  \\n\"That\\'s how everything changed my life and I was able to start a new life.\" \\nGaming for good\\nMayen, now located in Washington, DC, is CEO and founder of Junub Games. The company is getting ready to officially release its marquee product, \"Salaam,\" as an instant mobile game. \\n\"Salaam\" is a \"high-tension runner game\" that puts the player in the shoes of a refugee. The character is running from people trying to shoot and capture them and the players needs to keep their characters alive by getting them food, water, and medicine and eventually lead them to safe ground.\\nWhat makes \"Salaam\" (an Arabic word that means peace) more than just a game is Mayen\\'s plan to partner with non-profits so that when players buy food, water and medicine in the game, they are actually buying those items for people in refugee camps.\\nChris Boian with the office of the UN\\'s High Commissioner for Refugees says, \"What Lual\\'s game does is it provides people engaging in that game an opportunity to contribute actual relief and assistance to refugees.\"\\n\"It\\'s really a game changer,\" said Boian.\\nMayen hopes that \"Salaam\" provides an empowering message to not only its players, but those he\\'s trying to help. \\n\"You don\\'t have to be a charity to change the world. You can be an individual who is actually playing a video game, and you\\'re helping somebody in a refugee camp,\" said Mayen. \"I want other refugees to understand that we\\'re not here just to survive.

       "  'body': 'Washington (CNN)The Trump administration has informed Congress it intends to accept only 15,000 refugees this fiscal year, a new historic low for the US.\\nSince coming into office in 2017, the Trump administration has increasingly slashed the annual refugee cap, which determines how many may enter the US, to deeper lows. President Donald Trump has repeatedly demonized refugees, particularly those from Muslim-majority countries -- most recently at a campaign rally Wednesday evening. \\nThe proposed 2021 cap was denounced by humanitarian organizations and Democratic lawmakers. \\nIn a media note sent less than an hour before the end of fiscal year 2020 on Wednesday, the State Department said it had informed Congress of the proposed cap and said the US \"anticipates receiving more than 300,000 new refugees and asylum claims in Fiscal Year 2021.\" However, the vast majority of those would be asylum cases.\\n\"Of that number, up to 15,000 would be refugees admitted through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and more than 290,000 would be individuals in new asylum cases,\" the State Department note said.\\nThe proposal for fiscal year 2021 allows 3,000 fewer refugees than in the last fiscal year. The US had been already on course during the 2020 fiscal year to admit the lowest level of refugees since 1980 when the coronavirus pandemic hit and led to a pause in arrivals until late July. Only a little more than 9,000 refugees had been admitted to the US as of August 31, according to the Refugee Processing Center.\\nThe State Department claimed that the \"President\\'s proposal for refugee resettlement in Fiscal Year 2021 reflects the Administration\\'s continuing commitment to prioritize the safety and well-being of Americans, especially in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\"\\n\"It accounts for the massive backlog in asylum cases -- now more than 1.1 million individuals -- by prioritizing those who are already in the country seeking humanitarian protection,\" the agency said in the note released late Tuesday night. \"It also accounts for the arrival of refugees whose resettlement in the United States was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\\n\\'Cruel decision\\'\\nDemocratic Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Dianne Feinstein of California denounced the proposed refugee cap.\\n\"With this cruel decision, America has abandoned its leadership role in providing safety to refugees who are most in need of resettlement,\" they said in a statement Thursday. \"The Administration\\'s actions are a shameful betrayal of our longstanding bipartisan tradition of generosity and strength and accomplish nothing except failing to protect innocent victims of persecution who pose no threat to our security and have turned to America for safety.\"\\n\"President Trump has harsher words for innocent refugees than for the dictators they are escaping,\" they said.\\nEric Schwartz, president of Refugees International and former Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration, called the proposed cap \"disappointing but not surprising.\"\\n\"It is part of an overall strategy of fear-mongering and vilification of refugees,\" he said in a statement.\\nAt a campaign rally on Wednesday night in Duluth, Minnesota, Trump sought to foment fear about refugee resettlement.\\n\"Another massive issue for Minnesota is the election of Joe Biden\\'s plan to inundate your state with a historic flood of refugees,\" Trump said, claiming that Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders pledged a 700% increase in refugees to the state of Minnesota. \\n\"700% increase refugees coming from the most dangerous places in the world including Yemen, Syria and your favorite country Somalia. You love Somalia,\" Trump said. \"Biden would turn Minnesota into a refugee camp.\" \\nIn the first few months of his administration, Trump asked then-acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke why he could not ban refugees from \"f*****g Somalia\" in a bout of rage at his Bedminster golf club, according to the book \"Border Wars.\"\\nThe State Department said proposed refugee resettlement program contains \"specific allocations for people who have suffered or fear persecution on the basis of religion; for Iraqis whose assistance to the United States has put them in danger; for refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras; and for refugees from Hong Kong, Cuba, and Venezuela.\" The State Department has consistently assailed those in power in the latter three countries.\\nHowever, World Relief President Scott Arbeiter said in a statement that although the \"White House has made explicit promises to protect persecuted Christians abroad,\" they \"have not seen these promises honored through a robust US refugee resettlement program that has been a lifeline of protection for persecuted Christians.\"\\n\"Instead, we\\'ve seen the resettlement of refugees from countries known for persecution drop about 90% in some cases over the last four years. This is unconscionable. We urge the President to increase and sign the PD as soon as possible,\" Arbeiter said.\\nEach year, the administration sets a cap for how many refugees may be admitted to the US. Historically, the number of admissions has fluctuated according to world events, though they\\'ve generally been high.

       "  'body': 'London (CNN)The pandemic has put 500,000 more girls at risk of being forced into child marriage this year, reversing 25 years of progress that saw child marriage rates decline, according to a new report by the charity Save the Children.\\nBefore the global outbreak, 12 million girls married each year, now the charity warns that up to 2.5 million more girls could be at risk of child marriage over the next five years.  \\nWith up to 117 million children estimated to fall into poverty in 2020, many will face pressure to work and help provide for their families.\\n\"The pandemic means more families are being pushed into poverty, forcing many girls to work to support their families, to go without food, to become the main caregivers for sick family members, and to drop out of school -- with far less of a chance than boys of ever returning,\" Inger Ashing, CEO of Save the Children International, said in a press release.\\nThe pandemic led to school closures and \"experience during the Ebola outbreak suggests many girls will never return\" to class due \"to increasing pressure to work, risk of child marriage, bans on pregnant girls attending school, and lost contact with education,\" the charity wrote.\\nThis year, 191,200 girls in South Asia will be disproportionately affected by the risk of increased child marriage, the report says. It is followed by West and Central Africa, where 90,000 girls are at risk of child marriage, Latin America and the Caribbean (73,400), and Europe and Central Asia (37,200).  \\nGirls affected by humanitarian crises, such as wars, floods and earthquakes, face the greatest risk of child marriage, the report notes. Before the pandemic, data showed child marriage was increasing among refugee populations. In Lebanon, child marriage among Syrian refugee girls rose by 7% between 2017 and 2018.\\n\"Every year, around 12 million girls are married, 2 million before their 15th birthday,\" Ashing said. \"Half a million more girls are now at risk of this gender-based violence this year alone -- and these only are the ones we know about.

Actor Lena Headey, who has visited Moria, has written an op-ed to coincide with the exhibit\\'s opening. Headey has previously collaborated with the International Rescue Committee to bring attention to the European refugee crisis. She portrayed Cersei Lannister on the HBO TV series \"Game of Thrones.\"\\n (CNN)Moria. It was hell on Earth. Unclean, unsafe. Human rights didn\\'t exist.\\nI visited this sprawling \"reception center\" for refugees on the Greek island of Lesbos twice, in 2016 and again in 2019. By my second visit, the situation at the camp seemed to have reached new heights of desperation. Moria had already doubled its intended capacity and continued to grow each day, reaching six times its limit.\\nOn both visits I witnessed the intake of new people of all ages, including the elderly and young children. You would think these people were criminals, not human beings who had fled from war and endless, brutal threat.\\nSome of them spent months sleeping on makeshift cots with only silver blankets for warmth and comfort.\\nThere was no room. People were packed in, sharing space with complete strangers. Blankets were used as walls to offer some privacy.\\nThe toilets were a disgrace. Running water was often shut off. There was no lighting at night. Women were too scared to leave their tents, afraid to leave their children alone. There was a persistent threat of sexual violence.\\nThe simplest of day-to-day needs were not met. Getting food meant queuing for hours, only to receive the most inadequate meal you can imagine. Some simply chose to stay away, avoid the violence and starve.\\nBeing stuck in limbo, in such appalling living conditions and with no certainty about the future, had an alarming effect on the mental health of people who have been living in Moria; as an advocate for mental health, what I saw on Lesbos resonated deeply. \\nA report by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) last year revealed that over 60% of refugees treated at the IRC\\'s mental health center in Moria had considered suicide, with 30% having already attempted it. \\nLooking into the eyes of someone who has lost all hope is something you can never forget. \\nYou could feel the incendiary nature of that place. Fury and loss and despair -- unprotected, unsupported and uncertain about their futures. Mothers staring into the distance, hope gone, as if they couldn\\'t even see their own children in front of them.\\nThe hell hole that was Moria has now burnt to the ground. But the crisis isn\\'t going away. People continue to arrive every week on the shores of Greece and elsewhere needing protection; people who need shelter, food, love and recognition.\\nI met some extraordinary people in Moria, who were hugely inspiring. They need some hope. Why is it so difficult for us to offer this?\\nThe fire and the subsequent chaos, the loss of the few possessions these people had, that tiny thread of stability, is utterly heartbreaking; yet maybe, maybe it will move this forward.\\nThis problem needs a sustainable solution. We need to offer education and infrastructure, we need to give the opportunity for people to contribute, to be part of something. There should be sincere, significant efforts to improve services and facilities on the ground for refugees -- and a serious, humane effort to both expand legal pathways into Europe and share responsibility across the continent. \\nAfter the fire, both France and Germany said they\\'d take in more refugees from Lesbos. But one thing is abundantly clear. Greece cannot shoulder this alone. The European Union needs to step up. \\n\\n'},\n",

Let\\'s keep those chompers healthy, shall we?\\nHere\\'s what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. \\n(You can also get \"5 Things You Need to Know Today\" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)\\n1. Coronavirus\\xa0\\nMore than 1 million people have now died of the coronavirus worldwide, less than nine months after the first death was confirmed in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The US, Brazil, India and Mexico account for more than 50% of the total death toll. What\\'s worse: Cases in these stricken countries are still skyrocketing. India recently surpassed 6 million cases, and 95,000 people have died in the country -- although Indian officials warn these numbers may be woefully underreported. More than 141,000 people have died of the coronavirus in Brazil, the second highest total in the world, and the US tops the grim list with more than 200,000 deaths. While the world holds out hope for a vaccine to curb the devastation (35 are now in human trials around the world), health experts worry that the death toll may double before any widespread relief is available.\\xa0\\n2. Debate\\nTonight is the first of three scheduled presidential debates, and it\\'s shaping up to be a historic political donnybrook. President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden will take the stage at 9 p.m. at Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland Clinic. Fox News\\' Chris Wallace will moderate, and he\\'s released a list of six general topics: the candidates\\' records, the Supreme Court, Covid-19, the economy, race and violence, and election integrity. Of course, things may change as the debate goes along. For instance, Trump may need to answer to the recent bombshell news about his tax returns, as well as focus on earlier revelations about his handling of the pandemic.\\n3. Stimulus\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are trying once more to get a stimulus deal across the finish line before Election Day. To possibly sweeten the bitter negotiations on the Hill, Pelosi and other top Democrats have unveiled a new $2.2 trillion plan. That\\'s down from the $3.4 trillion measure that passed the House in May and has since been ignored by the GOP-led Senate. It would include another round of $1,200 stimulus checks to households under a certain income threshold, plus major funding for the Postal Service, coronavirus testing and small business aid. Still, it may be too pricey for Senate Republicans, who favored a now-defunct plan in the $500 billion range. But the sides have shared interests: Pelosi is under pressure from fellow Dems to cut a deal, and Trump and his allies could use a legislative win going into the final election stretch.\\xa0\\n4. Breonna Taylor\\nThe former Louisville, Kentucky, officer charged in connection with Breonna Taylor\\'s killing has pleaded not guilty to three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment. And there are more developments on the horizon. New body camera footage obtained by Vice News purportedly shows what happened in the moments after police raided Taylor\\'s home and opened fire. Meantime, an unidentified grand juror has asked state Attorney General Daniel Cameron to release grand jury transcripts in the case, adding to calls from Louisville\\'s mayor, Kentucky\\'s governor and Taylor\\'s family\\'s attorneys to do so. Cameron initially refused but has agreed to comply with a judge\\'s ruling ordering a recording of the grand jury presentation be added to the court\\'s case file. These legal revelations come amid unrest and dissatisfaction with the charges. So far, no officer who took part in the March raid has been charged in Taylor\\'s actual killing.\\n5. Wildfires\\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency as a new round of wildfires tears through the state. The Zogg and Glass wildfires have torched nearly 70,000 acres combined, killing three and laying waste to hundreds of structures as they spread over areas of Napa, Sonoma and Shasta counties. Nearby, the August Complex Fire, already the largest in California\\'s history, continues to threaten. There have been more than 8,100 wildfires in California this year, and firefighters continue to fight at least 25 major blazes. At least 26 people have died since fire activity in the state started to pick up in the middle of August.\\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\\nHere\\'s how astronauts vote from space\\xa0\\nSadly, it doesn\\'t involve a ballot and the world\\'s most powerful T-shirt cannon.\\xa0\\nAmazon wants you to pay with a wave of your hand\\nPlease, don\\'t make it any easier to spend money we don\\'t have on things we don\\'t need!\\xa0\\nRomanian village reelects mayor who died of Covid-19, saying he deserved to win\\nA true sign of respect.\\xa0\\nMariah Carey reveals she once recorded an alternative album\\nThis is the genre crossover we never knew we needed.\\xa0\\nA man covered his face with tattoos and turned his eyes black.

Read more opinion articles on CNN. \\n (CNN)This is how you live during a fire season during the sixth month of a pandemic: One day at a time. Our bags had been packed for a while now, our canned goods and go-boxes at the ready.  We\\'d already been through a couple of red flag warnings this year, and we expect more. And: Everyone around us is living this way. Everyone is weary, and everyone does their best to have a stiff upper lip.   \\nStill, last Wednesday, the horrible dark Mordor-red sky threw us. The blood-red, non-dawn, all-day smoke darkness felt newly extreme. I moved as if in a trance. I just wanted out. I was packing the kids\\' bags even before I knew it. I was throwing the contents of our fridge into a cooler. \\nJust to set the scene: We were already in the fourth fire and smoke season in a row in the Bay Area. This fire and smoke season has already been severe: It has already arrived early; it has already gone on a long time. The air had been unhealthy for the better part of a month Where we live, what that means is: We\\'ve kept our kids in, even when it was hot. We\\'ve kept the windows closed against the ash and smoky breezes.  We\\'ve felt stuffy and lonely and grumpy inside, and dizzy and headachy and light-headed outside.  After so much smoke, our lungs feel phlegmy and my daughter complains of sore throats.  And: Nobody has real school, nobody can go to anyone else\\'s house, everyone has already done every craft they remember.  We are sick of screens, tired of online yoga, aware of each other\\'s fragility. It\\'s already been hard, getting through the pandemic, for six months. It\\'s already been a rough season on top of a hard season on top of a bad one. \\nStill. We had kept finding some joys. We\\'d been getting by: if we did find that there was a pocket of good air, we\\'d drive there.  Under the smoke, we still live in a place of astounding beauty: and if the air seemed good we\\'d rearrange things, and drive to the beach or the ocean or a trailhead and find a good hour or two. We\\'d find a patch of blue sky, or a place where we could smell the sharp smell of bay or let the breezes play on our skin. And we\\'d be grateful, and inhale, and come back with some strength for being happy.  \\nDespite the horrible air last Wednesday, packing felt almost normal:  We had already been planning to leave that weekend.  In another year, we would have gotten away to savor the golden light of September, gone camping at the beach, tried to hang onto the sweetness of summer. This year, my only goal was—Just get someplace we can see the sky. Just get someplace where we all can breathe.  And that is how last Thursday we hit the road, hoping to stop on the eastern side of the Sierra, hoping to perch in a small cabin my friends sometimes rent out. \\nHowever: that was not to be. I did not realize the full magnitude of the smoke blowing down from Oregon.  By the time we arrived, the mighty Sierra Nevada Mountains, generally acknowledged to be a geological feature of great magnitude, were completely obscured by falling ash.  The air (which is unhealthy after 100) was 353.  We had already been driving through smoke for four hours.  My husband and I looked at each other.   We could not bring ourselves to drive home. We bought some hot dogs at a forlorn-looking stand in South Lake Tahoe. And then we floored it, further east.  \\nWe had been driving for eight full hours before the smoke cleared somewhere just outside Fallon, Nevada. Emerging outside it was a bit like being in that scene where Dorothy arrives in Oz, and the world flips back to color. I marveled at the reddish sand, at the delicate sage, at the wide cobalt blue of the sky. The kids got out and were delighted simply to play with rocks at a tumbleweed-filled pullout at the side of the road.  We felt awe as the air, like some mysterious, sweet elixir, sank deep into our lungs. And we looked back at what we had just left:  a wall of smoke and haze that extended behind us north and south as far as the eye could see.  Eventually we got in the car and kept driving east.  The wall of smoke receded behind us for hours. \\nThat night we made it to Salt Lake City; the next day, to my in-laws\\' farm in South Dakota 1,200 miles east, where we could spread out, do laundry, regroup. On the one hand, this seemed like an extreme choice. On the other hand, the air we left stayed bad all week, and has only just cleared, hopefully for a while.   And driving away, far far away, just like a far extension of how life goes these days.  I thought about how last year, we\\'d wanted to go to a friend\\'s house for my birthday, but had been evacuated because of fire.  And how the year before that, we\\'d abruptly driven into some other mountains above the smoke zone to wait out the air.   \\nI thought about how forests I love are burning right now, how scientists I know have been tracking the rise in temperature on the old growth forest floor to 1 degree centigrade per decade since 1970. As our human habitat sprawls into increasingly dry western ranges, I thought about how it\\'s a lot to ask all of us — plants and animals, cities and wild spaces—to absorb that change.  While I thought about those things, more than 40,000 people were evacuated from Oregon; and the New York Times ran a piece on climate migration in America. \\nSometimes we might hear the term \"climate refugee\" and think of someone already on a long, perhaps semi-permanent journey, somebody whose home place has already become deeply unlivable. We might think of families living on an island that is already sinking; farmers leaving fields where crops no longer grow; of young and hungry people fleeing a place where environmental collapse and political instability have already fused in a dangerous alchemy that makes continued civic life impossible.  \\nAnd, as for my family: No, we are not there. No, that is not us.  We can go home later this week, and hope the good wind holds. I do not know if I can say the same for the people evacuated from Oregon. \\nAs for us: we had a hard month in a bad year in a series of bad years. We just knew that where we live every year has become more exhausting, more smoky. And we were simply so fatigued  by this year\\'s version of the horror show that we drove half across the country to a place where we knew that we could reliably inhale and exhale.   \\nI keep thinking about that enormous wall of smoke, filling the whole sky, receding behind us for hours as we crossed Nevada.  I do not know how to explain the urgency and sadness I feel about losing our climate to those who can\\'t be convinced or do not care, or the creeping despair of watching new and continual cycles of devastation overtake the place I love and call home. I know that for so  many it is so much worse.  But this year, watching the smoke-filled sky recede for hours, the margin between our exhaustion and wider collapse felt as thin as it has ever been.\\nAn earlier version of this article included an inaccurate estimate of the number of Oregon residents told to evacuate from fires. The correct estimate is more than 40,000.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'A version of this story appeared in the September 30 edition of CNN\\'s Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\\n (CNN)President Donald Trump has been intent on shifting the framing of the 2020 race from a referendum on his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed some 200,000 American lives, to an ideological choice.\\nIf his goal during the first debate on Tuesday was to obscure his coronavirus record, Trump may have been successful, Eric Bradner and Kevin Liptak write. Despite Joe Biden\\'s attempts to inject it back into the discussion, the debate devolved into arguments and bickering that ultimately did not center on the global pandemic, which has now killed 1 million people. \\nBut there were moments where Biden, who has a 47-year career in politics, cut through.\\nSpeaking directly to families who now have an \"empty seat at the kitchen table,\" Biden slammed the President for having \"no plan\" to contain the virus, or limit its impact on the American economy. He added, \"You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap and your golf course and go in your Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives.\"\\nInstead of mounting a robust defense of his administration\\'s response to the crisis, Trump mocked Biden for wearing a mask, sought to claim that were Biden president, he would have done worse, and alleged that the former-VP wanted to shut down the economy. Check out our fact-check of those claims below.\\nFACT-CHECKING COVID-19 FALSEHOODS FROM THE DEBATE\\nCoronavirus and masks\\nIn a heated exchange with Biden, Trump said that Dr. Anthony Fauci changed his mind about the impact of wearing masks.\\nFacts First: This needs context. Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, did change his mind about masks, but the need to wear one is not an ongoing debate, as Trump implied. Last week, Fauci told CNN\\'s Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta that his evolving advice about masks is a \"classic example\" of how guidance can change as additional scientific evidence emerges. The pandemic, he said, is an \"evolving situation.\"\\nFauci explained that in the spring, \"we were not aware that 40 to 45% of people were asymptomatic, nor were we aware that a substantial proportion of people who get infected get infected from people who are without symptoms. That makes it overwhelmingly important for everyone to wear a mask.\" -- Jen Christensen\\nCoronavirus and the economy\\nTrump claimed several times that Biden wants to shut down the country to address the coronavirus, while he wanted to keep it open.\\nFacts First: This is false. Biden said in an August interview with ABC that he would shut down the country if scientists told him it was necessary -- but he has not himself advocated a shutdown or introduced a shutdown plan. Additionally, he clarified his comments after the interview, saying in September, \"There is going to be no need, in my view, to be able to shut down the whole economy.\"\\nIt\\'s also worth noting that presidents themselves cannot shut down the country. You can read a longer fact-check here. -- Tara Subramaniam \\nCoronavirus and travel restrictions\\nTrump referenced the travel restrictions his administration imposed on foreign nationals who had been in China, then attacked Biden for remarks he had made the same day: \"I closed it, and you said, \\'He\\'s xenophobic. He\\'s a racist and he\\'s xenophobic,\\' because you didn\\'t think I should have closed our country.\"\\nFacts First: This needs context. It\\'s not clear Biden even knew about Trump\\'s China travel restrictions when he called Trump xenophobic on the day the restrictions were unveiled; Biden has never explicitly linked his accusation of xenophobia to these travel restrictions.\\nThe campaign says Biden\\'s January 31 accusations -- that Trump has a record of \"hysterical xenophobia\" and \"fear mongering\" -- were not about the travel restrictions, which Biden did not know about at the time of his speech. Biden never took an explicit position on the restrictions until his April declaration of support. You can read more about Biden\\'s comments here. -- Tara Subramaniam\\nON OUR RADAR\\nThe World Bank has announced plans for a $12 billion vaccine financing plan to help poor and developing countries secure doses as effective drugs become available, Reuters reports. India could have 60 million Covid-19 cases -- 10 times the official figure.    Filippo Grandi, the UN\\'s high commissioner for refugees, estimated that half of all refugee girls won\\'t go back to school after the pandemic in an interview with CNN\\'s Becky Anderson. Writing in The Washington Post, seven former commissioners of the US Food and Drug Administration said the Trump administration is undermining the agency\\'s credibility as it prepares to roll out a vaccine.  Disney is laying off 28,000 employees as the pandemic hammers its theme parks.   The NFL is facing its first major outbreak of the season after players and personnel for the Tennessee Titans and the Minnesota Vikings tested positive for Covid-19.

New York City will offer free masks to people -- and fine those who refuse to wear one -- as the rate of positive tests in parts of Brooklyn and Queens climb above 3% for the first time in months.Germany could see nearly 20,000 new infections per day in the winter months unless urgent action is taken, Chancellor Angela Merkel said. The Dutch government is introducing stricter measures in an attempt to clamp down on coronavirus infections -- the daily rate is now more than double the record during the first wave. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson blundered in explaining his government\\'s own coronavirus lockdown rules, fueling criticism that they are too complicated.\\nTODAY\\'S TOP TIP\\nThe coronavirus is leading to a secondary pandemic -- hunger. The need for emergency food has exploded since March of 2020. According to an Oxfam report, this hunger crisis could soon kill more people each day than the infection itself.\\nThe hunger crisis had already been exacerbated by climate change, existing conflicts, and inequalities. But now, coupled with Covid-19, people worldwide have hunger and malnutrition to worry about even more. Here are some ways you can help: \\nLook for volunteer opportunities at your local food bank or community kitchenBuy locally grown food to directly support smallholder farmers in your own community, many of whom donate unsold and unused food to neighbors in need Financial donations to anti-hunger initiatives also help.

       "  'body': ' (CNN)Puerto Rican architect Carla Gautier Castro stands overlooking the remains of a home after a string of earthquakes hammered the town of Yauco, on the southwest of the island. \\nIt\\'s a painful scene she has seen again and again. It is also the reason she now dedicates her life to ensuring everyone on the island has a safe dwelling.  \\nThe pillars of this concrete house collapsed, crushing three vehicles underneath. Furniture and personal belongings are strewn around, unreachable, unsalvageable.  \\n\"I\\'m traumatized,\" homeowner Luz María Morales Vargas tells Gautier Castro. \"We\\'ve lived here for 27 years.\" \\nMorales Vargas and her husband were sleeping inside their home when a 5.8 magnitude earthquake hit on January 6, 2020. Then a second, stronger one the following day. It forced hundreds of residents like Morales Vargas to move into makeshift outdoor camps.  \\n\"I haven\\'t lost nothing. This is all material. I got my life,\" she says.  \\nThe emotional burn Morales Vargas feels is all-too-familiar; three years ago, she felt similar heartache when Hurricane Maria damaged her home.\\n\"I was devastated,\" she recalls. The 2020 earthquakes took a brutal toll on Puerto Rico. But Hurricane Maria remains the worst natural disaster the island has ever seen, a Category 5 storm that caused more than 3,000 deaths, $40 billion in damages and destroyed 70,000 homes. Two years after the storm, some 30,000 families were still living under blue tarps, their homes not repaired, according to local government estimates.\\n\"It doesn\\'t have to be this way,\" Gautier Castro says.\\nOn the island, life after Maria \\n\"Hurricane Maria changed everything for everyone here in Puerto Rico,\" Gautier Castro says.\\nHer own life shifted course as she found a new mission after witnessing her homeland\\'s  devastation. \\nDays after Maria, she took a job as a FEMA construction inspector. \\n\"I remember this one case. This lady came to us and we couldn\\'t find her house. We realized that we couldn\\'t find the house because there was absolutely nothing left. The desperation in that woman\\'s face was just... I\\'m just never gonna forget it.\" \\nGautier Castro takes a deep breath, holding back tears, the memories still raw. \\n\"That was the type of reaction that drove me to find a different solution, because I knew that this was actually a case for most people in Puerto Rico.\" \\nThe people needed shelter, durable structures. That\\'s when the young architect had an idea: shipping containers.\\nGautier Castro first saw container home structures while visiting Europe and the mainland US as an architectural student. \\nThe containers, she explains, are already built \"to withstand the most adverse weather conditions.\"  \\n\"I realized that if we could make an entire home -- a basic home that could cover all your needs with this structure -- it meant that we can do it a lot quicker and a lot cheaper because we\\'re substituting the columns, beams, walls with just one piece,\" she says. \\nShe took her idea to a structural engineer who validated the concept. \\nThe result, by using an anchored shipping container, Gautier Castro created a home that could withstand both earthquakes and hurricanes with winds in excess of 175 miles per hour. \\nReady to put the concept to work, Gautier Castro founded KONTi Design Built Studio, a San Juan firm dedicated to transforming shipping containers into hurricane and earthquake-proof housing. \\n\"KONTi is challenging the way we look at construction in Puerto Rico. We want everyone to feel safe when disaster hits,\" she says. \\nAffordable construction for everyone\\nGautier Castro\\'s work as a FEMA inspector became an eye-opening experience for this third-generation architect. She realized that one reason so many homes were destroyed during Maria was because many people could not afford formal, code-compliant construction. A 2018 Puerto Rico Home Builders Association study found that around 55% of the island\\'s housing units were built informally, outside of existing regulations governing construction and land use.\\nAdditionally, the median household income in Puerto Rico is about $20,000 compared with a median home value of about $113,500, according to census data. \\nConstruction costs can be prohibitive for many families since materials must be imported onto the island.\\n\"The math just doesn\\'t add up. This is where KONTi comes in. We\\'re designing a home that for $39,000, you can have a safe, sustainable home that includes two bedrooms, one bathroom, kitchen cabinets, security windows and doors,\" says Gautier Castro. \\nThe units are built in Puerto Rico using local labor and materials. A basic KONTi model can be built in less than two months. \\nFor an additional cost, a KONTi home can function completely off the grid, equipped with a solar panel system, rainwater collection tank, and a bio garden septic tank system.\\nA dream come true \\nFor KONTi homeowners Mildred Díaz and Luis Amador, their container home is a dream come true. For years, they tried to build a forever home on a vacant lot on the island of Vieques, off the southeast coast of Puerto Rico. But high construction costs and concerns over future hurricanes halted the project. \\n\"Every year, everyone in Vieques lives with their hair standing on end waiting to see if we will get hit by another hurricane,\" says Díaz. \"This is the best option.\" \\nToday, the couple sits in their new living room, where two massive doors provide a vista of the ocean.\\n\"I open those doors,\" says Amador, pointing at the view, \"and I\\'m in paradise.\"  \\n\"It is affordable, and feasible. You feel safe. It\\'s a long-term investment. And if you want to take it with you, you can move it anywhere,\" says Amador.\\nGautier Castro says building this house for Diaz and Amador is one of her proudest moments. \\nKONTi\\'s ultimate goal is to produce 100 units a month from a factory in Puerto Rico, where they can be shipped all over the globe. Gautier Castro believes container homes are a worldwide solution to housing crises caused by natural disasters and refugee influxes.  \\n\"It\\'s important that we build for this new generation,\" she says. \"Because their future starts with their basic needs and a home is just that. They need to be safe in order to fulfill their full potential.\" \\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Washington (CNN)In the span of less than two weeks, a time that was supposed to be a peak of President Donald Trump\\'s first term has turned into one of the lowest points of his presidency -- with a series of clear missteps leaving Trump and many of his closest allies infected with the coronavirus and down in the polls. \\nIt began when Trump nominated a new Supreme Court justice. Then came a bombshell New York Times story revealed just how little the President paid in taxes. And while a story like that normally would have led national headlines for weeks, all eyes pivoted toward Trump\\'s positive coronavirus diagnosis and subsequent hospitalization.\\nIt all comes less than a month before the 2020 presidential election. \\nThe latest CNN poll out Tuesday showed Democratic nominee Joe Biden with the widest lead in the election cycle and both vice presidential nominees gearing up for a debate Wednesday night.\\nTrump, meanwhile, is promising a return to the campaign trail, even though it\\'s not clear when he\\'ll recover from the virus. \\nHere\\'s a look back at the last 11 days:\\nSaturday: Trump nominates Barrett to the Supreme Court\\nAs the pandemic continued to rage across the US, Trump held a White House Rose Garden ceremony to announce that he would nominate Judge Amy Coney Barrett to replace the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg as a justice on the US Supreme Court. \\nA nomination so close to the election marked an opportunity for the President to set himself apart in the race -- nominating a third Supreme Court justice in one presidential term, and potentially cementing a conservative court for a generation. \\nThe event brought in prominent supporters and Senate allies from across the country, most of whom declined to wear a face mask. Cameras captured audience members in the Rose Garden sitting close together and some were seen greeting one another with close hugs and kisses. \\nIn the days after the announcement, several of those audience members caught getting close on camera or listed as attendees -- including former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Utah Sen. Mike Lee -- tested positive for the coronavirus. And at least three journalists and several White House aides near the President would test positive, too. \\nSunday and Monday: New York Times publishes the Trump taxes story, backlash ensues\\nA comprehensive report published by The New York Times indicated that Trump paid no federal income taxes whatsoever in 10 out of 15 years beginning in 2000 because he reported losing significantly more than he made. \\nIn both the year he won the presidency and his first year in the White House, Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes, the Times reported.\\nDetailing payments gleaned from more than two decades of tax information, the Times report outlines extensive financial losses and years of tax avoidance that deal a blow to the business-tycoon brand Trump has built his political career on.\\nTrump has denied the Times\\' reporting and claimed that he pays \"a lot\" in federal income taxes.\\nThe likelihood that Trump personally owes unknown creditors hundreds of millions of dollars, as revealed by the Times, has also raised concerns about how the President\\'s financial entanglements could influence his national security decisions, former officials and experts told CNN.\\nThe report also fueled fresh attacks on the President in the final weeks of the presidential campaign, including Tuesday\\'s presidential debate.\\nAlso on Sunday, Trump\\'s former campaign manager, Brad Parscale, was hospitalized following reports of a suicidal threats at his Florida home. He later resigned from his role as a senior adviser to the campaign. \\nTuesday: The first presidential debate of 2020 \\nTrump and Biden took part in the first US presidential debate on Tuesday. \\nThroughout the night, Trump interrupted Biden and moderator, Fox News Sunday\\'s Chris Wallace. Biden called Trump a clown and told him to shut up. At one point, Trump refused to denounce White supremacists -- a comment he had to grapple with throughout the rest of the week. He also mocked Biden for wearing a mask.\\nAnd once again, the President questioned the legitimacy of the election results and continued misleading attacks on voting by mail. \\n\"If it\\'s a fair election, I am 100% on board. But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can\\'t go along with that,\" Trump said. \\nAfter their face-to-face, six in 10 debate watchers said Biden did the best job in the debate, and just 28% said Trump did, according a CNN Poll of debate watchers conducted by SSRS. \\nTrump also repeatedly touted the state of the economy during the debate, but that same day, Disney announced it would be laying off 28,000 employees. \\nWednesday: Trump holds a rally in Minnesota, his aide gets sick on Air Force One\\nTrump held a rally and private fundraiser in Minnesota on Wednesday, and despite backlash over his refusal to denounce White supremacists the night before, Trump resurfaced racist attacks on Somali refugees and Minnesota\\'s Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar.\\nOn the way back to Washington after the rally officials said one of the President\\'s top aides, Hope Hicks, began developing coronavirus symptoms. She was isolated in a separate cabin and was seen deplaning from the rear steps of Air Force One. \\nAmerican Airlines and United Airlines also announced that they would be laying off a total of 32,000 employees, after it was made clear that Congress and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were unable to reach a deal to help their industry. \\nThursday: Trump holds a fundraiser in New Jersey despite aide\\'s coronavirus diagnosis\\nOfficials at the White House were aware that Hicks had tested positive for coronavirus, though it\\'s not clear exactly when her results came back. Still, Trump went ahead with his schedule, holding a fundraiser at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\\nSometime after his return from Bedminster, Trump received a preliminary positive coronavirus rapid test result. \\nHe revealed Friday at nearly 1 a.m. that he and first lady Melania Trump tested positive, tweeting: \"Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!\"\\nFriday: Trump heads to Walter Reed\\nThe President was initially being treated within the White House, but Friday afternoon, the President boarded Marine One en route to Walter Reed Military Medical Center, where White House officials said he would stay for treatment for a few days. \\nWhite House officials had serious concerns about Trump\\'s health on Friday evening, CNN reported. A Trump adviser said, \"This is serious,\" describing Trump as very tired, very fatigued and having some trouble breathing.\\nSaturday: White House doctors hold a news conference\\nWhite House physician Dr. Sean Conley and other members of the President\\'s medical team briefed reporters on Saturday, offering a rosy assessment of Trump\\'s condition. \\nConley claimed Trump was doing well and has been fever-free for 24 hours, contradicting CNN\\'s reporting.\\nAfter the briefing, a White House official offered a more alarming assessment of Trump\\'s health to reporters, saying: \"The President\\'s vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning ... We are still not on a clear path to a full recovery.\"\\nLater, The Associated Press and The New York Times identified that official as White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.\\nSunday: Trump takes a drive outside the hospital to wave at supporters\\nOne of the physicians treating Trump, Dr. Brian Garibaldi, said Sunday the President is being given the steroid drug dexamethasone as part of his Covid-19 treatment.\\nLater Sunday, a still infected Trump departed Walter Reed to slowly drive past a group of supporters gathered outside the hospital. \\nSealed inside an SUV with Secret Service agents donning masks, eye protection and gowns, Trump -- also masked -- waved at supporters alongside the road. \\nAfterward, members of the Secret Service voiced escalating concern at what many of the agency\\'s personnel have determined is total disregard for their well-being amid the pandemic. \\nAgents have tested positive for the virus while traveling for the President\\'s political rallies, which he insisted on maintaining even against federal health guidelines. As employees self-quarantine or isolate in place, others have been forced to work longer hours to fill the void.\\nMonday: Trump returns to the White House\\nThe President announced that he would be leaving the hospital Monday afternoon via Twitter.\\nConley said that Trump\\'s condition \"continued to improve\" and \"met or exceeds all standard hospital discharge criteria.\" Conley also acknowledged that the President \"may not be entirely out of the woods yet,\" but said Trump\\'s current condition supported a \"safe return home.\"\\nTrump, who continued to be heavily medicated, appeared to be breathing with some difficulty on Monday evening after he mounted the South Portico steps to pose for cameras while saluting his Marine One helicopter. A White House official and a separate source close to the White House said there remain lingering health concerns, even after Trump returned home.\\nTrump removed his mask upon his arrival at the White House. And in a propaganda video produced about his return, the President, who remains infected with the virus, mused, \"Now, I\\'m better and maybe I\\'m immune? I don\\'t know.\"\\nTuesday: CNN poll has largest Biden lead yet, Trump resumes tweeting\\nBiden\\'s advantage over Trump expanded in a nationwide CNN Poll conducted by SSRS that was released Tuesday, leading the former vice president to hold his widest lead of the election cycle.\\nAmong likely voters, 57% say they back Biden and 41% Trump in the poll that was conducted entirely after the first debate and mostly after the President\\'s coronavirus infection was made public.\\nThe White House did not announce any public events for the President\\'s first full day out of the hospital. And offices once buzzing with activity within the White House complex amid the pandemic were largely empty, as many decamped to work from home or quarantined following multiple positive coronavirus test results from the President\\'s closest aides.  \\nBut online, Trump has returned to business as usual and is mulling a national address as soon as Tuesday -- even though he is supposed to be recovering. \\n\"Will be back on the Campaign Trail soon!!! The Fake News only shows the Fake Polls,\" Trump wrote, responding to CNN\\'s latest poll. \\nThe President also declared that he would be attending next week\\'s presidential debate in Miami, despite his uncertain prognosis and the potential that he could still be contagious by then. In another tweet, he wrote, \"FEELING GREAT!\"\\nLater, he dramatically pulled the plug on a deal to supply more stimulus funding to combat the economic losses caused by the pandemic, causing the markets to plunge just before close.\\nWednesday: Vice presidential debate\\nVice President Mike Pence and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris are set to face off at a debate Wednesday night. \\nPence and Harris have tested negative for coronavirus since Trump\\'s diagnosis, but they will now be seated 12 feet apart, after the Biden campaign raised health concerns over the initial seven feet of distance planned. \\nIt will mark the candidates\\' first face-to-face since Trump\\'s diagnosis. \\nCNN\\'s Paul LeBlanc, Lauren Fox, Kara Scannell, Jennifer Agiesta, Kevin Liptak, Betsy Klein, Sam Fossum and Tami Luhby contributed to this report.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'New York (CNN Business)The multibillion dollar \"Star Wars\" franchise is getting a new video game that takes players to the skies. Inspired by the \\'90s Star Wars flight games, \"Star Wars: Squadrons\" came out Friday, and its main draw is letting fans pilot their own spaceships, zooming past debris and space rocks to fire down enemy targets. \\nElectronic Arts\\' Motive Studios made the game, which was licensed by Disney. And compared with some of EA\\'s other popular titles, like the \"FIFA\" franchise, \"Squadrons\" is a relatively small game — it doesn\\'t come with a bunch of extra features, nor does it encourage users to make additional software purchases. It\\'s also priced lower, at $40 compared with $60 to $70 for typical EA games. \\n\"Squadrons\" focuses on the pilot fantasy element of the \"Star Wars\" franchise for the bulk of its game, which takes place after the events of \"Star Wars: Return of the Jedi.\" CNN Business got to try it out. In the game\\'s main campaign, you alternate between helping the Empire and the opposing side, the New Republic. You take missions like protecting refugees and finding missing scouts. \\nEach starfighter you pilot has lasers and shields, and you can also aim missiles at your targets. The controls involve spinning your starfighter rapidly in outer space, weaving and dodging incoming attacks.\\nThe game also has a multiplayer mode including dogfights and fleet battles, and it supports virtual reality for a more immersive experience. It\\'s available on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC. Console and PC players can game together.\\nInstead of asking players to buy cosmetic upgrades with dollars, \"Squadrons\" gives you an in-game currency called Glory when you play the game longer and complete challenges.\\nThis monetization approach is far different from EA\\'s 2017 \"Star Wars Battlefront II,\" which included in-game purchases totaling hundreds of dollars to unlock more content.\\nEA caught flak in 2017 for that game as Belgium regulators looked at whether the title\\'s loot boxes constituted gambling. In 2018, Belgium banned loot boxes from games.\\nIn a July earnings call, EA chief financial and operating officer Blake Jorgensen said that the \"Squadrons\" title \"doesn\\'t have the breadth of some of our other games... that\\'s why we chose to price it at a slightly lower level to also allow access to as many people as possible who had that Star Wars fantasy.\"\\nCEO Andrew Wilson said that they considered players\\' expectations and \"$40 felt like the right price point.\"\\nYung Kim, senior research analyst for securities firm Piper Sandler, told CNN Business he believes the lower price reflects how much time and money EA invested in the game. For instance, the story campaign in the game is shorter than last year\\'s \"Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,\" as that title placed greater emphasis on narrative.\\n\"The price point and dearth of features, including a lack of loot boxes and so on, is a reflection that the game itself is not as deep as some others,\" he said. \"I don\\'t believe EA has changed its strategy overall or taken the prior issues into account.\"\\n\\n'},\n",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\\n (CNN)The President of the United States is scared, and it\\'s starting to show. Donald Trump has tested positive for Covid-19, as have more than a dozen people close to him, including several sitting senators, members of his debate prep team, several members of his staff, his campaign manager and his own wife, first lady Melania Trump. The organizers of his next debate with Democratic nominee Joe Biden, which was scheduled for Thursday of next week, wisely announced a plan to move the debate to an online format. After all, who in their right mind would put a coronavirus patient in an enclosed room with other people, including vulnerable American voters and at least one other senior citizen, for at least 90 minutes of yelling and spewing?  \\n \\nTrump, apparently -- who, to be fair, is often not particularly right-minded.  \\n \\nThe President went on Fox News Thursday morning and, in a rambling and rage-filled interview, told anchor Maria Bartiromo that he wasn\\'t going to \"waste\" his time on a virtual debate, even though public health protocols -- not to mention basic common sense -- dictate that the President should be quarantined until he is no longer infectious. \"That\\'s not what debating is all about,\" he said. \"You sit behind a computer and do a debate -- it\\'s ridiculous.\" \\nFollowing the President\\'s comments, his campaign manager Bill Stepien issued a statement saying Trump would participate in the second debate if it\\'s moved back by a week. The Biden campaign has rejected the proposal and has said the Democratic presidential nominee will hold a town hall to take questions from voters on October 15. \\nAn exchange of arguments and ideas is in fact what debating is all about -- something Trump stomped all over in the last presidential debate, when he refused to abide by the agreed-upon rules and instead tried to shout and bully his way through the event. He relied on the same tactics in his call-in to Fox, which was an ugly and incoherent spectacle, even for this president.\\nTrump called the Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris a \"monster\" and a \"communist\" who wants to \"open up the borders to allow killers and murderers and rapists to pour into our country.\" He also blamed Gold Star families for giving him the virus. And he made a series of bizarre, demonstrably false, and stunningly narcissistic claims. \"I\\'m back because I am a perfect physical specimen and I\\'m extremely young,\" said the senior citizen president, who is 74, clinically obese, living with heart issues, and currently infected with Covid-19.  \\n \\nThe President calls into Fox News because, unlike more legitimate and nonpartisan news outlets, they will let him rant and lie. A real exchange of ideas, and being checked on his falsehoods, is ultimately what Trump is afraid of. Without any real plans for combating the coronavirus, keeping Americans insured and able to access healthcare, or righting the economy -- without the ability to coherently articulate any policy proposals at all -- a virtual debate eliminates Trump\\'s advantages and exposes his considerable weaknesses. It also keeps the audience, the moderator, and the candidates safe.  \\n \\nTrump has always been a showman without substance, someone who thrives on the emotional energy of a room, whether that\\'s supporters cheering him while booing refugees or his opponents radiating frustration and disdain in response to his attacks. He leads a cult of personality that has taken over the whole of the Republican Party. The GOP did not release a new platform for 2020, the first time in the party\\'s more than 160-year history. Instead, a one-page resolution simply affirms fealty to the leader. It would be sad if it weren\\'t so scary. \\n \\nA virtual debate would make it much more difficult for Trump to pull his usual attention-grabbing stunts and to evade having to actually speak to policy questions. Presumably, someone in the control room would have the ability to mute the candidates\\' microphones. Split-screen framing would likely require both candidates to sit down, which would impede whole-body gesticulating and lurching. The President\\'s attempts at intimidation would pack far less punch, and watching him try to bully an opponent through a screen would make it far easier to see his juvenile antics for what they are.  \\n \\nWhile a virtual debate would be less optimal for Trump, it would be of far greater benefit to viewers. We would have an opportunity to actually hear each candidate articulate their vision for our country without being interrupted or bulldozed. It could be a real debate, not a contest of who can yell the loudest and talk over the other most effectively. If that puts Trump at a disadvantage because he is unable to debate ideas, well, the American people deserve to know that. And if the President truly does refuse to participate in the debate, then let Joe Biden show up alone and answer audience questions.  \\n \\nAn in-person debate is a public health risk, full stop. At the first presidential debate, the President\\'s family flouted public health rules by removing their masks as soon as they entered the room. Just days later, the President and the first lady tested positive for Covid-19. \\n \\nThe next debate is supposed to be a Town Hall, where voters ask questions. Are we really asking American citizens to show up, in person, to an event in an enclosed space with a man who has already demonstrated he does not do nearly enough to protect himself and his staff from infection?  \\n \\nAll over the country, Americans have made big sacrifices to adjust to our new normal. We have held weddings, baby showers and funerals online. We have sent our children to remote school. We have attended work meetings, job interviews and exercise classes via Zoom. No, it\\'s not ideal. But a great many of us have radically adjusted our personal and professional lives to keep ourselves, our families and our communities safe from a highly contagious disease.  \\n \\nThe men who want to sit in the Oval Office can do the same. \\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Amanda Mattingly is a Truman National Security Project fellow and a former foreign affairs officer at the US Department of State. She served at the US Embassy in Caracas in 2002-2003. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.\\n (CNN)I\\'ve met Nicolás Maduro, and he\\'s about the last person you\\'d want running a country. He\\'s an incompetent authoritarian. He has driven his country and its economy into the ground. \\nHis brand of Bolivarian socialism is a corrupt sham, a con job on Venezuela\\'s poor and a sorry excuse for a political-economic model. Venezuela suffers from a humanitarian, political and economic disaster thanks to Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chávez. \\nAs successive authoritarian leaders, they have stripped away Venezuela\\'s economic viability and democratic institutions while consolidating power.\\nNow, I can tell you Joe Biden is no Maduro. He is no radical, corrupt socialist, and he is certainly no friend to Maduro. False rhetoric about Biden and communism has been circulating in southern Florida in this election year, with South Florida voters particularly susceptible to assertions that Biden wants to install Cuban or Venezuelan-style socialism in the United States. Exploiting traumatic memories of life in Cuba under the Castros and in Venezuela under Chávez and Maduro, Trump is stoking their fears in search of votes. \"Joe Biden is a PUPPET of CASTRO-CHAVISTAS,\" Trump tweeted Saturday. \\nGiven the importance of Florida in US presidential elections, and the particular importance of Latino voters in South Florida, these false narratives about Biden could be important in determining who serves as America\\'s next President.\\nThe truth is that Biden is a moderate Democrat and American patriot who has a long record in the US Senate, and as vice president, of taking a tough stance on American adversaries -- like Maduro -- and of advocating for a smart, integrated US foreign policy in Latin America.\\nNot only is it ludicrous to compare Biden to Maduro, it is also ludicrous to think that Biden wouldn\\'t take a tough stand against him. In early 2019, Biden recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the legitimate interim leader of Venezuela within weeks of Guaidó proclaiming himself the rightful President and calling for new, free and fair elections. Guaidó has been accepted as the legitimate leader of Venezuela by more than 50 countries, including the US. He knows that Biden will be a strong ally against Maduro and for efforts to bring about a peaceful democratic transition in Venezuela.\\nAs Biden said earlier this year and again in Miami on Oct. 5, \"Maduro is a dictator, plain and simple.\"\\nAmerican policy toward Venezuela should focus first and foremost on democracy. Before the Trump administration, democracy promotion had been a cornerstone of US foreign policy in Latin America and around the world. The US should work to regain its leadership role in promoting and upholding democratic principles, institutions, and governance. The US should definitely not be suggesting the possibility of an American military intervention or the tacit approval of a military coup in Venezuela. American diplomats should get back in the business of promoting and defending democracy.\\n \\nThe US should also be defending human rights and taking a tougher stand against Maduro and his regime, which has been accused of abuses by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and a recent UN report. The Venezuelan government has denied such reports, making it all the more important for the US to put its weight behind any efforts to hold Maduro to account.\\n \\nAmerican\\'s stance on Venezuela should be tough, but it should also open up new diplomatic opportunities with allies in Latin America and Europe. \\nRather than closing down avenues for diplomacy, the US should work to open new paths for cooperation. Unfortunately, this administration has squandered the trust and mutual respect necessary to build a strong multilateral coalition to address Venezuela\\'s crisis. America\\'s foreign policy works best when the US works with partners and provides principled, values-driven leadership in multilateral organizations. Right now, the US should be leading the efforts at the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Lima Group to promote a peaceful and democratic transition in Venezuela. Working through these institutions, the US gains legitimacy and support for its agenda. \\nIn the absence of strong US leadership, Latin Americans across the region are losing faith in democracy and in the US as a partner for a better future.\\nA credible and effective US policy would also respond to the humanitarian disaster that has befallen the Venezuela people. More than 5 million Venezuelans have fled their country out of fear of political persecution and in search of economic opportunities. Meanwhile, untold thousands could be dying of Covid-19 due to a collapse of the health care system. In 2019, Doctors for Health found that 70% of Venezuela\\'s public hospitals reported only intermittent access to water, as Human Rights Watch notes.\\nThe US should be working with Colombia and Brazil to address this disaster and its spillover throughout the region, specifically by targeting assistance to refugees and the neighboring countries bearing the brunt of the exodus. The US government should also extend Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Venezuelans in the US, a group that includes approximately 200,000 eligible Venezuelans who have sought refuge from the crisis in their home country, according to the Congressional Budget Office. \\nBiden has pledged that he would do this if elected.\\nRather than doubling down on cruel policies and draconian economic sanctions that squeeze the Venezuelan people -- but benefit the Maduro regime by offering him cover for his economic failures -- a new US-Venezuela policy should seek to help \"el pueblo,\" the people.\\nAmerica\\'s failed policies on Cuba should be a lesson, and Venezuela should not fall victim to a repeat of that anachronistic approach. For decades, we have provided the Cuban regime with an excuse for its own failed economic policies, and now we are doing the same for Venezuela. Never-ending sanctions on Cuba have not resulted in regime change. That tactic will not work in Venezuela either. Sweeping economic sanctions primarily hurt the people of these countries and make them ever more prostrate before their authoritarian governments. You can see that in the hours-long lines for food in Havana and the hours-long lines for gas in Caracas. \\nTargeted sanctions on specific individuals in the Maduro government, military, and security services would be more effective. By the end of 2019, and almost a year after the United States imposed broad economic and oil sanctions on Venezuela, 96% of households in Venezuela were living in poverty, and of that number, 79% in extreme poverty. Yet, Maduro remained in power. \\nUS sanctions should target Venezuelan nationals supporting and funding Maduro; those who commit human rights violations; those who undermine democratic processes and institutions like the National Electoral Council (CNE); and those who run drug trafficking and money laundering operations. \\nThe blunt tool of general sanctions further degrades the poor economic conditions in which the majority of Venezuelans now live. We are deepening their suffering rather than providing leverage for a solution.\\nCurrent US-Venezuela policy also pushes Venezuela closer to Russia, China, and Iran. Over the last several years, we have seen these countries lending to the Venezuelan government, taking control of the Venezuelan oil sector, and most recently, allegedly buying Venezuelan gold in exchange for gasoline.\\nThe situation in Venezuela is heartbreaking. The sooner free and fair elections can be held to elect a new leader, the better. Under a Biden administration, the US will regain its leadership in the region and work toward that day when Venezuela sees there is a peaceful, democratic transition.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'After visiting the US in the 1970s, Akyaaba Addai-Sebo in 1987 initiated Black History Month in the UK, which is celebrated in October. He moved to the UK to seek refuge from political persecution in Ghana in 1984, working to promote diversity in a variety of roles for organizations including the Greater London Council, African Refugees Housing Action Group, Notting Hill Carnival, and Organization of African Unity. In 2014, he was executive producer of \"One Humanity,\" a documentary on the 1988 and 1990 Wembley concerts for Nelson Mandela.\\n (CNN)Black History Month (BHM) is a celebration of our diversity -- all the colors of the rainbow that sparkle out of the black hole of creation. We share common roots in the dark, tropical wombs of our mothers and our strength lies in the variety within our oneness.\\nBHM pays eternal tribute to this fact of our origins during the splendor of the days following the Fall Equinox, a glorious spectacle of seasonal balance, a harmony we also need in our relations with one another. \\nOctober is a period of recognition, reconciliation, renewal and a review of the state of Black Britain.\\nBHM was created for the younger generation to own and fill with rich and enabling content. It was inspired by six-year old Marcus, whose mother named him after legendary Black nationalist leader Marcus Garvey. She and I worked at the Greater London Council (the capital\\'s main governing body, now replaced by the Greater London Authority), and she came in distraught one day because her son had asked her why he could not be White. She felt that British society and the school system had failed Marcus by making him question his identity at that early age.\\nSomething had to be done to make the Black Child believe in themselves. After weeks of reflection, what stirred in me was the urgency of creating a permanent celebration in the UK of Africa\\'s contribution to world civilization from antiquity to the present, and especially its contribution to the development of London, and the United Kingdom as situated in Europe. \\nI had lectured about African traditions in the United States, and children and their parents told me it had given them a new sense of self. Despite all its grand institutions of higher education, the UK was still a touchstone for colonialism, imperialism and racism. \\nI devised a plan with the help of the pioneering team at the GLC\\'s Ethnic Minorities Unit (EMU), ably led by Ansel Wong. We launched the GLC Historical Lectures and Concerts, which took place in February through May 1986 to affirm Africa\\'s contribution to civilization. For a week, we filled the Royal Albert Hall with schoolkids to listen to inspirational music and talks. Speakers toured the communities and generated a buzz. \\nWe helped draw attention to heightened campaigns against systemic racism in the UK and apartheid in South Africa at that time. This work radiated from the EMU to all corners of the UK and across Europe to Africa and the US. Rev. Jesse Jackson, Angela Davis, Winnie Mandela, Marcus Garvey Jr., Sally Mugabe, Graca Machel, John Henrik Clarke, Yosef Ben-Jochannan, Burning Spear, Ray Charles, Max Roach, Hugh Masekela and many more came to London between 1985 and 1988 at the invitation of the GLC to support the anti-racist and anti-apartheid campaigns.\\nThe lectures were compiled into a book and published under the title \"Our Story,\" which I edited with Ansel Wong.\\nCoincidentally, 1987 was the 150th anniversary of Caribbean emancipation, the centenary of the birth of Marcus Garvey and the 25th anniversary of the Organization of African Unity, an institution dedicated to advancing the progress of African states. The new London Strategic Policy Unit declared it African Jubilee Year, calling on UK authorities to recognize the contributions of Africans to the economic, cultural and political life of the UK, take their duties as enshrined in the 1976 Race Relations Act seriously, be relentless in their support against apartheid and ensure that Black children enjoy positive images of themselves. \\nThe African Jubilee Year declaration gave birth to Black History Month. October was chosen because it was shortly after the UK summer vacation and was the traditional harvest period and time when African leaders gathered to settle differences and appraise the state of the community. The month is now dedicated in the UK to the celebration of the African Story in the creation of our one humanity. The greatest of all teaching is \"Man, know thyself\" and the national curriculum and the playground must not fail the Black Child.  Many hands and brains helped to give birth to Black History Month and we salute them all.\\nI am pleased to see the communal BHM activities that people independently initiate and the flood of solidarity messages that pour in from government, mayors, corporate leaders, the police, and others. It has long been my desire to see a formal opening ritual broadcast live on the night of September 30. \\nAs British Prime Minister Boris Johnson articulated, Black History is Our History. The confluence of Black Lives Matter and Covid-19 has exposed the fragile underbelly of our humanity, which has to be handled carefully, like the proverbial African egg placed in your palm. The adage is that if you squeeze too hard the egg will crack, and if you let it loose in your grip it will fall and break. \\nBHM makes demands on authorities to name monuments, parks and buildings after illustrious African leaders, and to ensure that Black children do not lose the fact of their genius. BLM has caused the tearing down of monuments that affirm the Doctrine of Discovery used by colonizing nations to give currency to the trans-Atlantic slave trade and plantation economy. BLM has triggered the removal of statues of Christopher Columbus and Belgium King Leopold, and BHM is demanding the removal of the noose of the French colonial tax. Both are a rallying call.\\nAnsel and I have been working on preparing the youth for the future development of Africa and people of African descent. We are passing on the baton of social justice and we are happy with the trend towards humanizing society. The abuse of power must be excised from society. Social media has made the world a global village for the youth, making them aware of the mess my generation has caused, from environmental degradation to genocidal wars. The raging fires of California and the roaring tsunamis of Mozambique; earth, wind and fire are now of popular concern. I hope it is within the scope of the younger generation to make this world a better place as they reach out and touch hands. \\nFor Black History to matter, Black Lives must matter. For Black Lives to matter, Black History must matter. To deny a person\\'s history is to deny their humanity and to enslave them. This noose and jackboot of enslavement as represented by lynching and asphyxiation continues to be enacted by people in uniform, and it is revulsion at this humiliation that is at the heart of the Black Lives Matter revolt against systemic racism. These uniforms have come to crystallize the impunity of racism in private and public life, which defiles our common humanity.\\nWhere lies your duty of care? Despite all the armaments of war and display of human arrogance, we remain so fragile, and as such we must remain each other\\'s keepers and celebrate the beauty in each other. For you cannot crush a caterpillar and be astounded by the beauty of a butterfly. Black Lives Matter; so does Black History. \\n\\n'},\n",
