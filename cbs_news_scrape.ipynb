The Trump campaign said Saturday they plan to appeal.U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann granted a request from Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar to dismiss the lawsuit that alleged Republicans had been unconstitutionally disadvantaged because certain counties permitted voters to cure their mail ballots. \\u00a0President Trump\\u0027s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, insisted Saturday that there \\\"is so much evidence that in Pennsylvania, Democrats eliminated our opportunity to present 50 witnesses and other evidence that election officials blatantly ignored Pennsylvania\\u0027s law denying independent review.\\\"But this Trump campaign brief tried to rehash claims that the campaign appeared to abandon earlier this week. \\u00a0The\\u00a0brief\\u00a0filed Saturday, which is littered with spelling errors, including the governor\\u0027s name, alleges that illegal votes were counted and poll watchers were unable to access vote counting \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 allegations that the Trump campaign dropped just last Sunday, before Giuliani was put in charge of the president\\u0027s growing legal challenges.\\u00a0Attorney\\u0027s for the president wrote that certifying the 2020 presidential election would cause \\\"irreparable harm\\\" and set the stage for \\\"Governor Wolfe,\\\" referring to Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, to appoint Pennsylvania\\u0027s electors before December 8, the \\\"safe-harbor\\\" post-election deadline.Federal law says states have until six days before members of the Electoral College gather in person to certify election results and\\u00a0determine their electors, a date known as the \\\"safe harbor\\\" deadline. Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida\\u00a0introduced\\u00a0legislation to push back this deadline back from December 8 to January 1, giving states more time to ensure all legal votes are counted, but the measure is highly unlikely to be taken up before Election Day.The Trump campaign further alleges that Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar \\\"engaged in an intentional scheme to count mail ballots which did not comply with Pennsylvania law in order to favor Joseph Biden over President Donald J. Trump.\\\" Giuliani notoriously told presiding Judge Matthew Brann, of the Middle District of Pennsylvania, just last week: \\\"This is not a voter fraud case.\\\"The lawsuit,\\u00a0Trump v. Boockvar,\\u00a0U.S. District Court for Middle District of Pennsylvania, seeks to block Boockvar from certifying the election by claiming, thus far without evidence, that the campaign was denied meaningful access to observe and monitor the electoral process through its poll watchers.\\u00a0The campaign estimates more than 680,000 ballots were processed in two Pennsylvania counties, Allegheny and Philadelphia, \\\"when no observation was allowed.\\\" An\\u00a0amended complaint\\u00a0from the Trump campaign filed on November 15 alleged disparate treatment of mail-in voters among different counties, but dropped claims it was denied access to observe.Giuliani made baseless allegations about mail-in voting during a hearing on Tuesday, claiming \\\"widespread, nationwide voter fraud, of which this is a part.\\\" Mark Aronchick, who argued on behalf of some county election boards, lambasted Giuliani, calling his arguments \\\"disgraceful.\\\"Mr. Trump\\u0027s lawyers said in a filing with the court that the campaign intended to file a second amended complaint \\\"to restore claims which were inadvertently deleted from their amended complaint, and to add claims based on newly learned facts.\\\"CBS News projected Mr. Biden as the winner in Pennsylvania on November 7, when he edged ahead of Mr. Trump by over 34,000 votes. Pennsylvania\\u0027s 20 Electoral College votes brought him to 273, more than the 270 needed to win the election. After several other states were called, Mr. Biden is expected to win 306 Electoral College votes.\\u00a0Nicole Sganga and Melissa Quinn contributed to this report.\\u00a0\",\"alternativeHeadline\":\"Judge quashes Trump campaign latest attempt to stop Pa. results\",\"video\":{\"@context\":\"https:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"@type\":\"VideoObject\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"https:\\/\\/www.cbsnews.com\\/video\\/trump-continues-to-deny-election-loss\\/\"},\"name\":\"Trump continues to deny election loss\",\"description\":\"President Trump again falsely claimed Friday that he won re-election, challenging President-Elect Joe Biden\\u0027s victory, and met with Michigan legislators in an apparent attempt to stoke distrust in the election results.

      "A federal judge in Pennsylvania on Saturday dismissed a lawsuit by the Trump campaign that sought to block the certification of Pennsylvania's election results. The Trump campaign said Saturday they plan to appeal.\n",
      "U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann granted a request from Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar to dismiss the lawsuit that alleged Republicans had been unconstitutionally disadvantaged because certain counties permitted voters to cure their mail ballots.  \n",
      "President Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, insisted Saturday that there \"is so much evidence that in Pennsylvania, Democrats eliminated our opportunity to present 50 witnesses and other evidence that election officials blatantly ignored Pennsylvania's law denying independent review.\"\n",
      "But this Trump campaign brief tried to rehash claims that the campaign appeared to abandon earlier this week.  \n",
      "The brief filed Saturday, which is littered with spelling errors, including the governor's name, alleges that illegal votes were counted and poll watchers were unable to access vote counting — allegations that the Trump campaign dropped just last Sunday, before Giuliani was put in charge of the president's growing legal challenges. \n",
      "Attorney's for the president wrote that certifying the 2020 presidential election would cause \"irreparable harm\" and set the stage for \"Governor Wolfe,\" referring to Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, to appoint Pennsylvania's electors before December 8, the \"safe-harbor\" post-election deadline.\n",
      "Federal law says states have until six days before members of the Electoral College gather in person to certify election results and determine their electors, a date known as the \"safe harbor\" deadline. Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida introduced legislation to push back this deadline back from December 8 to January 1, giving states more time to ensure all legal votes are counted, but the measure is highly unlikely to be taken up before Election Day.\n",
      "The Trump campaign further alleges that Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar \"engaged in an intentional scheme to count mail ballots which did not comply with Pennsylvania law in order to favor Joseph Biden over President Donald J. Trump.\" Giuliani notoriously told presiding Judge Matthew Brann, of the Middle District of Pennsylvania, just last week: \"This is not a voter fraud case.\"\n",
      "The lawsuit, Trump v. Boockvar, U.S. District Court for Middle District of Pennsylvania, seeks to block Boockvar from certifying the election by claiming, thus far without evidence, that the campaign was denied meaningful access to observe and monitor the electoral process through its poll watchers.\n",
      " The campaign estimates more than 680,000 ballots were processed in two Pennsylvania counties, Allegheny and Philadelphia, \"when no observation was allowed.\" An amended complaint from the Trump campaign filed on November 15 alleged disparate treatment of mail-in voters among different counties, but dropped claims it was denied access to observe.\n",
      "Giuliani made baseless allegations about mail-in voting during a hearing on Tuesday, claiming \"widespread, nationwide voter fraud, of which this is a part.\" Mark Aronchick, who argued on behalf of some county election boards, lambasted Giuliani, calling his arguments \"disgraceful.\"\n",
      "Mr. Trump's lawyers said in a filing with the court that the campaign intended to file a second amended complaint \"to restore claims which were inadvertently deleted from their amended complaint, and to add claims based on newly learned facts.\"\n",
      "CBS News projected Mr. Biden as the winner in Pennsylvania on November 7, when he edged ahead of Mr. Trump by over 34,000 votes. Pennsylvania's 20 Electoral College votes brought him to 273, more than the 270 needed to win the election. After several other states were called, Mr. Biden is expected to win 306 Electoral College votes. \n",

       "  'body': 'Ocilla, Georgia — An immigration detention center in Georgia performed questionable hysterectomies, refused to test detainees for COVID-19 and shredded medical records, according to a nurse quoted in a complaint filed Monday.\\xa0\\nThe complaint to the Homeland Security Department\\'s internal watchdog relies on accounts of Dawn Wooten, who worked full-time as a licensed practical nurse at the Irwin County Detention Center until July, when she was demoted to work as needed. \\n Wooten calls a gynecologist who works outside the facility \"the uterus collector.\" \\n \"Everybody he sees has a hysterectomy - just about everybody,\" Wooten said. \"He\\'s even taken out the wrong ovary on a young lady.\"\\n It was unclear to Wooten if women knowingly consented to the operations. Nurses raised concerns about the doctor, who is unnamed.\\n \"These immigrant women, I don\\'t think they really, totally, all the way understand this is what\\'s going to happen depending on who explains it to them,\" she is quoted saying.\\nThe facility in Ocilla, about 200 miles south of Atlanta, houses men and women detainees for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as inmates for the U.S. Marshals Service and Irwin County. \\n ICE said it does not comment on matters before the inspector general but that it takes all allegations seriously.\\n \"That said, in general, anonymous, unproven allegations, made without any fact-checkable specifics, should be treated with the appropriate skepticism they deserve,\" the agency said in a statement.\\nDr. Ada Rivera, the top doctor at the agency, issued a statement saying the whistleblower accusations will be investigated by an independent office, adding, \"However, ICE vehemently disputes the implication that detainees are used for experimental medical procedures.\"\\n\"All female ICE detainees receive routine, age-appropriate gynecological and obstetrical health care, consistent with recognized community guidelines for women\\'s health services,\" Rivera said. Her statement also said that, according to ICE data, two detainees at Irwin County Detention Center have had hysterectomies since 2018.\\nAccording to the statement, both individuals were \"referred to certified, credentialed medical professionals at gynecological and obstetrical health care facilities for hysterectomies in compliance with National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) standards. Based on their evaluations, these specialists recommended hysterectomies. These recommendations were reviewed by the facility clinical authority and approved.\"\\n\"To be clear, medical care decisions concerning detainees are made by medical personnel, not by law enforcement personnel,\" Rivera added. \"Detainees are afforded informed consent, and a medical procedure like a hysterectomy would never be performed against a detainee\\'s will.\"\\nLaSalle Corrections, which owns and operates Irwin County Detention Center under contract, did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Monday.\\n While the 27-page complaint filed by the Government Accountability Project and advocacy group Project South quotes unidentified detainees extensively, it also includes detailed comments from Wooten. The complaint says Wooten was demoted after missing work with coronavirus symptoms, which she believes was retaliation for raising questions about addressing COVID-19.\\n Wooten said the number of detainees infected was much higher than reported because there was no active testing and not all cases were reported, according to the complaint.\\n Wooten is quoted as saying the sick call nurse sometimes fabricated seeing detainees in person when they hadn\\'t and that she saw the nurse shred a box of detainee complaints without looking at them. She said nurses ignored detainees reporting COVID-19 symptoms.\\n If detainees reported a fever, nurses would put them on an over-the-counter cold medication for seven days without testing them for COVID-19, she said.\\n Wooten said the facility declined to use two rapid-testing COVID-19 machines that ICE purchased for $14,000 each. No medical staff had been trained on them and she saw the machines used only once.\\nGovernment Accountability Project staff attorney John Whitty said, \"Ms. Wooten\\'s whistleblowing disclosures reveal not only gross mismanagement from LaSalle leadership, but actions that deliberately put the health of detainees, workers, and the public at risk. It is up to DHS to heed the warnings of employee whistleblowers like Ms. Wooten and take action to enforce protective measures against the rampant spread of COVID-19.\"\\nProject South Staff Attorney Priyanka Bhatt remarked that, \"For years, advocates in Georgia have raised red flags about the human rights violations occurring inside the Irwin County Detention Center. Ms. Wooten\\'s whistleblowing disclosures confirm what detained immigrants have been reporting for years: gross disregard for health and safety standards, lack of medical care, and unsanitary living conditions at Irwin.\\n\"We call on DHS to conduct an investigation into the Irwin County Detention Center in order to protect the health and safety of the detained immigrants and the workers there.\"\\nAs of Sunday, 42 detainees at the facility had tested positive for the virus, according to ICE. Nationwide, 5,772 detainees were positive.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'The Trump administration on Tuesday said it is reimposing its \"public charge\" wealth test for green cards that had been blocked during the pandemic, a move likely to alarm advocates, who have warned about the policy\\'s impact on immigrant communities ravaged by the coronavirus.\\nThe 2019 rule, which gives officials more power to deny permanent residency to applicants the government deems rely or could rely on public benefits like food stamps or housing vouchers, was\\xa0blocked in late July\\xa0by a federal judge who found it was hampering efforts to contain the virus.\\nCiting\\xa0declarations\\xa0by doctors and local officials who said immigrants across the country feared they could jeopardize their immigration status by seeking medical treatment and government aid during the pandemic, Judge George Daniels blocked the policy\\'s implementation for the duration of the national coronavirus emergency.\\nHowever,\\xa0subsequent orders\\xa0by the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, including one earlier this month, limited and ultimately suspended Daniels\\' ruling, allowing the Trump administration to again enforce the public charge test.\\nIn updated guidance on its website on Tuesday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said it would apply the 2019 public charge test to all future and pending green card applications filed after February 24, 2020, when the agency implemented the rule following the Supreme Court\\'s\\xa0green light. Applications filed after Daniels\\' injunction in July that have been approved will not be re-adjudicated, USCIS said.\\nThe \"public charge\" standard was first included in U.S. law in the early 1880s, when the U.S. government began to restrict and regulate immigration at the federal level, including by banning Chinese immigrants\\xa0under the premise that they \"endangered the good order\" of certain American communities. The term \"public charge\" essentially means being an economic burden on the country.\\nWhile the test was used for decades to prohibit the entry of certain low-income immigrants and, in some cases, to deport them, its definition was expanded by the Trump administration\\'s 2019 rule, which superseded\\xa0Clinton-era guidance\\xa0that instructed officials to only deem immigrants public charges if they were receiving government cash benefits or long-term institutionalized care.\\nThe 2019 rule broadened the type and amount of benefits that count against immigrants seeking to stay in or move to the U.S., requiring immigration caseworkers to consider enrollment in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), certain federally funded Medicaid benefits, and a variety of forms of government-subsidized housing, including Section 8 vouchers.\\nAdvocates have strongly criticized the policy, pointing to\\xa0research\\xa0about the \"chilling effect\" it has had on immigrant households that fear the consequences of accessing government benefits, including those comprised of green card holders and U.S. citizens, who are not subject to the public charge test. The Trump administration, however, has argued the policy promotes self-sufficiency among immigrants.\\n\"That expectation in our law that legal immigrants who are going to stay here long-term can stand on their own two feet is a very long-standing not just tradition, but it\\'s a long-standing legal requirement,\" Ken Cuccinelli, the second-in-command at the Department of Homeland Security, told CBS News in a recent interview. \"I can cite family history in my Italian family about people who were sponsors and making sure their sponsorees had jobs and those kinds of things. That\\'s what we expect.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Houston — An appeals court refused Sunday to allow the Trump administration to resume detaining immigrant children in hotel rooms before expelling them under rules adopted during the coronavirus pandemic.\\xa0\\nThree judges on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals left in place a lower court\\'s order that requires the U.S. to stop using hotels in most situations to detain children unaccompanied by a parent. The judges denied the U.S. government\\'s request for a stay of that order. \\n Border agents since March have placed at least 577 unaccompanied children in hotel rooms before expelling them from the country without a chance to request asylum or other immigration protections. The Trump administration argues it has to expel most people crossing the border due to public health considerations. Advocates for immigrants accuse the administration of using the coronavirus as a pretext to restrict immigration. \\n \"It is a sad fact that court involvement was needed once again to ensure the basic safety of children,\" said Leecia Welch, an attorney with the National Center for Youth Law.\\n The appeals court judges were sharply critical of the administration during oral arguments, questioning why children in the hotels weren\\'t guaranteed access to lawyers and why the government wasn\\'t using existing youth shelters that have thousands of empty beds. Those shelters offer legal services as required under a longstanding court settlement known as the Flores agreement.\\n A spokeswoman for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday.\\n Justice Department lawyer Scott Stewart argued that the Flores agreement doesn\\'t apply to children detained in hotels before expulsion.\\n \"Sometimes, you know, letting people have lawyers even if you\\'re not obliged to might be a good idea,\" said Judge William A. Fletcher, an appointee of President Clinton. Fletcher added it was \"an argument you may be about to lose as to whether or not the Flores agreement applies.\" \\n Stewart said the government\\'s policy of expelling unaccompanied children was part of a \"comprehensive, systematic approach\" to fight the coronavirus.\\n \"The idea is turn away as quickly as possible, at the border, potential vectors of infection,\" he said, adding that a variety of factors led to some children being detained for weeks.\\n U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee\\'s Sept. 4 order said hotel detention violated \"fundamental humanitarian protections\" and said the Trump administration had not demonstrated that using hotels would prevent the spread of COVID-19. \\n Under the Flores agreement and federal anti-trafficking law, most unaccompanied immigrant children who cross the border, with or without authorization, are supposed to be transferred to government shelters. \\n The Trump administration has set aside that practice during the pandemic. Instead, it has hired contractors to confine children and families to hotel rooms until they can be expelled. Lawyers who work with immigrant children have said they often don\\'t know who is being detained and where. \\n \"The problem is we\\'re seeing children held for far longer than a few days, in some cases up to a month, in a hotel,\" said Carlos Holguin, a lawyer for the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law who opposed the Justice Department\\'s position.\\n In total, the U.S. has expelled at least 147,000 people since March, including 8,800 children unaccompanied by a parent, according to government figures filed in court in September. Most are not detained in hotels. Many of those people have been directly sent back across the U.S.-Mexico border. Others, including unaccompanied children, are held for days or weeks in Border Patrol facilities unequipped for long-term detention before they are taken to deportation flights.\\n'},\n",

The billboards include photos of individuals who ICE calls \"public safety threats,\" some of their charges, the name of the local jurisdiction that released them and a phone number to call with information about the cases.\\xa0\\nBeneath each photo, ICE warns: \"CRIMINAL ALIEN Sanctuary Policies are a REAL DANGER.\"\\n\"The placement and the timing — the placement being Pennsylvania and the timing being a month before the election — make it clear that this is a political move, not related to operational matters,\" David Lapan, a retired U.S. Marine colonel and former DHS press secretary during the Trump administration, told CBS News. \"We\\'re almost four years into the administration. Why wasn\\'t this done sooner if that was something they thought was important?\"\\nJohn Sandweg, who led ICE on an acting basis during the Obama administration, said he doesn\\'t believe the agency \"has ever done anything\" like the billboards. \"It\\'s a political advertisement in favor of the president or at a minimum, against politicians that they disagree with. And that\\'s just wildly inappropriate,\" Sandweg told CBS News.\\nAnother former senior ICE official, John Amaya, who served as the agency\\'s deputy chief of staff under President Obama, said the billboards were part of the Trump administration\\'s \"propaganda machine.\"\\n\"This is just beyond the pale,\" Amaya told CBS News. \"They have shown that they are happy and eager to use ICE as a blunt force instrument in their political toolbox, but this is taking things to a whole new level.\"\\nAt the center of ICE\\'s new public messaging campaign, which was first reported by CNN, is the issue of \"detainers,\" which are requests for local authorities to hold on to undocumented immigrants who would otherwise be released after being charged and processed so that federal deportation officers have time to apprehend them. These requests are not signed by judges, but by ICE officials who identify non-citizens in local custody who the agency suspects are deportable. \\xa0\\nSeveral local jurisdictions have limited or banned their acceptance of detainers, which some federal courts have found to violate constitutional protections when they don\\'t meet the \"probable cause\" threshold to detain someone. The Trump administration has waged a concerted and public battle against these local policies, arguing that they allow immigrants to potentially re-offend and force ICE agents to arrest them in their homes and communities.\\nICE oversees civil immigration detention and its agents are authorized to arrest and deport recent border-crossers, other undocumented immigrants and legal permanent residents convicted of certain crimes.\\xa0\\nMike Dunn, a spokesperson for the city of Philadelphia, one of the localities targeted in the billboards, accused the Trump administration of seeking to fuel \"anti-immigrant fervor one month before the election.\"\\xa0\\n\"To be clear: the City of Philadelphia has always cooperated with ICE when that agency goes before a judge and obtains a federal arrest warrant,\" Dunn said in a statement to CBS News. \"This is not burdensome and ICE has, in fact, obtained such warrants on several occasions. In other words, we fully comply with federal law. The reality is that the White House has tried to coerce cities like Philadelphia into going beyond federal law.\"\\nDunn said trust between local law enforcement and immigrant communities is key to fighting crime, echoing one of the main reasons major cities like New York cite when defending \"sanctuary\" policies.\\nA spokesperson for Pennsylvania\\'s Allegheny County, another jurisdiction named in the billboards, declined to comment.\\nICE did not respond to a series of questions posed on Friday evening, including requests to address the criticism by former DHS officials. The agency also did not explain why it decided to launch this campaign now or say whether it is planning to erect more billboards across the country.\\n\"Too often sanctuary policies limiting cooperation with ICE result in significant public safety concerns,\" Tony Pham, the senior official performing the duties of the agency\\'s director, said in a statement included in Friday\\'s announcement. \"ICE will continue to enforce immigration laws set forth by Congress through the efforts of the men and women of ICE to remove criminal aliens and making our communities safer.\"\\nWhile there was significant disagreement over immigration enforcement between the Obama administration and some jurisdictions, the Trump administration has sought to publicize its crackdown on \"sanctuary\" localities, even attempting to strip them of federal funds.\\nICE routinely issues press releases highlighting cases of local authorities not honoring \"detainers\" and often denounces counties and cities for adopting policies that restrict cooperation with the agency.\\xa0\\nMore recently, ICE has touted enforcement operations in large Democratic-run cities and jurisdictions, including nation-wide sweeps that yielded 2,000 arrests and an operation in North Carolina\\'s Mecklenburg County, whose sheriff stopped honoring certain detainer requests. In March, ICE announced it would scale back arrests during the coronavirus pandemic and focus on apprehending immigrants deemed to pose a threat to the public.\\nLapan, the former senior DHS official, questioned why ICE would highlight cases of immigrants who have not been convicted of pending charges on the billboards. \"If we are operating under the presumption of innocence until proven guilty and fair trial, why call out immigrants in that way?\" Lapan said, adding later, \"It\\'s not something we would do with citizens. Why should we do that with immigrants?\"\\nDuring Mr. Trump\\'s tenure, DHS, which oversees ICE, has come under scrutiny for what critics say is the politicization of the third-largest federal department. Its aggressive response to anti-racism demonstrations and sometimes violent protests in Portland was viewed by some as an effort to promote Mr. Trump\\'s \"law-and-order\" campaign message.\\n\"I think the way that DHS has operated, the way it has become politicized, the way that DHS has become in some way a propaganda arm of the White House, has damaged the department\\'s reputation and its credibility,\" Lapan said. \"I think it\\'s going to take some time to repair that damage.\"\\nAmaya, the former senior ICE official, echoed Lapan\\'s sentiment. \"The way they\\'re trying to instill and create fear in the community is beyond the pale, even for the most conservative officers at ICE.\"\\nDHS did not respond to a request for comment.\\nCésar Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a University of Denver professor who studies immigration enforcement, noted there\\'s a history of immigrants being portrayed as menacing people and dehumanized, citing the now-removed highway signs of migrant families crossing the border. The ICE billboards, García Hernández added, represent the \"latest publicity stunt\" to \"stir fear that exists in many people in the United States and to try to deploy that strategically as a political selling point.\"\\n\"It fits in very neatly into the Trump administration\\'s approach to immigration policy, which has been, from the start of the presidential campaign, one that embraces the emotional appeal of depicting migrants as fiendish, as demonic,\" García Hernández told CBS News.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'A 15-year-old girl who has lived in the U.S. with her family since she was an infant is now alone in government custody and facing deportation after she was arrested by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at a Texas hospital.\\nThe teenager, who was born in Mexico and does not have legal status, went to a hospital in Edinburg, Texas, with her aunt last week after experiencing gallbladder-related pain, her attorney, Sarah Valdes, told CBS News. She was then referred to undergo surgery in another hospital in San Antonio.\\xa0But the girl and her aunt, who is also undocumented, did not have proper documents to travel through a CBP checkpoint on the way to San Antonio. CBP operates dozens of highway checkpoints in the interior of the country near the borders with Mexico and Canada. At these checkpoints, designed to curtail human and drug smuggling, agents can ask travelers for their immigration status.\\nCBP told CBS News that it learned of the family\\'s status and sent Border Patrol agents to the Edinburg hospital to provide documents the child could use to travel through the checkpoint and to \"process her and her aunt consistent with their immigration status.\"\\xa0\\n\"There are protocols in place with area medical facilities to prevent delays or the detention of individuals traveling through the checkpoints to seek emergency medical care,\" CBP said in a statement.\\xa0\\xa0Valdes said CBP arrested the girl\\'s aunt at the Edinburg hospital. The 15-year-old was taken to San Antonio and underwent the prescribed surgery, but CBP officials went to the second hospital and guarded the girl\\'s room, according to Valdes.\\nAfter the surgery, the 15-year-old girl, who found herself in a hospital without an accompanying adult family member, was taken into CBP custody and designated an unaccompanied migrant child. U.S. anti-trafficking law requires all government agencies, including CBP, to transfer undocumented minors classified as unaccompanied to the U.S. refugee agency, which holds children in shelters and other housing facilities.\\xa0\\xa0CBP officials confirmed the agency apprehended and processed the girl before transferring her to the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Her aunt, meanwhile, was \"processed in accordance with CBP policy in relation to her immigration status\" and sent to an U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center for adults, the officials added.\\nDespite living in the U.S. for the vast majority of her life, the 15-year-old undocumented girl has now been placed in a U.S. government shelter while ICE seeks to deport her to Mexico. Her current predicament stems from her classification as an unaccompanied migrant child under a law that was enacted to protect recent border-crossing minors from exploitation.\\n\"It\\'s a reiteration of family separation,\" Valdes, a lawyer for the Texas-based Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES), told CBS News. \"She\\'s only unaccompanied because they showed up at the hospital and they arrested her adult family member.\"\\nValdes said her client also tested positive for coronavirus while hospitalized.\\xa0\\nThe Administration for Children and Families, which oversees the Office for Refugee Resettlement, declined to comment on this story. CBS News is not disclosing the girl\\'s name because she is a minor. Fearing reprisals, the teenager\\'s parents, who live in the U.S., declined to be interviewed through Valdes.\\nAsked about the reported immigration arrests at its\\xa0Edinburg location, the South Texas Health System said it \"is committed to delivering high-quality care to all patients.\"\\n\"While we appreciate the interest and worthiness of this news story, national patient privacy laws prohibit us from making any further comment at this time,\" the company said in a statement to CBS News.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'The 2020 presidential election will pit two drastically different visions on immigration against each other, with the victor retaining or assuming broad executive authorities that have dominated policy-making on the issue for decades in the absence of congressional action.\\nPresident Trump\\'s reelection would allow his administration to continue cracking down on unauthorized immigrants, limiting legal immigration and curtailing humanitarian protections for foreigners. During a second term, Mr. Trump could also see through major policy changes to the U.S. immigration system that have so far been stalled by federal courts.\\nIf victorious, Joe Biden will inherit an immigration system transformed by hundreds of changes made by the Trump administration, including a series of restrictive asylum policies, sweeping green card rules, broader deportation priorities, a decimated refugee program and pandemic-era border restrictions.\\nCurrent and former senior Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials and people close to the Biden campaign said the process of unwinding the Trump administration\\'s immigration policies could be an arduous and long effort.\\n\"There has been such a demolition of our traditional immigration system under this administration, that the biggest challenge will be deciding where to begin rebuilding first,\" León Rodríguez, who led U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) during President Obama\\'s second term, told CBS News.\\nCristóbal Alex, a senior Biden adviser, said the former vice president would take \"immediate actions to undo Trump\\'s horrific immigration policies,\" but conceded some \"will take longer than others.\"\\nRescinding Mr. Trump\\'s presidential edicts, such as his travel ban on a group of mostly African and Asian countries, will be easier than scrapping the \"public charge\" wealth test on green cards and visas instituted through federal regulations, officials said. Other changes will require appointing an attorney general committed to overturning precedent-setting decisions, such as one issued by Jeff Sessions in 2018 to restrict asylum for victims of gang and domestic violence.\\n\"Stated policies are fairly easy to reverse, from a practical perspective,\" Rodríguez said. \"Regulations present a bit more complicated case. Most of the regulations that would be of concern to a Biden administration are the subject of legal challenges. And so, the status of those legal challenges will play a big role in what strategy a Biden administration would choose.\"\\nKen Cuccinelli, the second in command at DHS, said he expects the Trump administration\\'s legacy on immigration to endure — even if the president loses reelection. Changing regulations, he added, is \"very slow.\"\\n\"It\\'s not like someone shows up on day one and can stop doing regulation A, B or C,\" Cuccinelli told CBS News. \"Anyone looking to undo all that is going to have a lot of work to do.\"\\nBiden will be under pressure from progressives to quickly reverse Mr. Trump\\'s changes, while also separating himself from some Obama administration practices unpopular with the immigrants\\' rights community. Returning to Obama-era policies, especially when it comes to deportations and the detention of migrant families, will not be sufficient, progressive activists warn.\\n\"Biden needs to undo the harm, make advancements to decrease the level of enforcement and create other opportunities for people to get status,\" said Javier Valdés, the co-executive director of Make the Road Action and a member of a task force of Biden and Bernie Sanders supporters who created a unified\\xa0immigration platform. \"When I say undo the harm created by the U.S. government towards immigrant communities, I\\'m not just saying what happened under Trump. Yes, it was on steroids, but this has been a historical issue.\"\\nIn 2014, as Univision anchor Jorge Ramos pressed him on the high number of deportations during his presidency and accused him of \"destroying many families,\" Mr. Obama grew visibly frustrated.\\nMr. Obama strongly defended his record on immigration, citing his creation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative for \"Dreamers,\" as well as his attempt to create another deportation protection program for undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and green card holders. He also blamed Republican opposition in Congress for the inability to pass comprehensive immigration reform. However, the 3 million U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportations executed during his presidency angered activists, who dubbed Mr. Obama the \"deporter in chief.\"\\nMore than 749,000 deportations were carried out in the fiscal years with available statistics under Mr. Trump\\'s tenure. Midway into Obama\\'s presidency, ICE deported more than 400,000 immigrants in a single year — a record-high.\\n\"I always say that Trump is abusing the ICE deportation machine that Obama built,\" Amy Maldonado, a Michigan-based immigration lawyer, told CBS News. \"And by most measures, Trump has been a lot worse than Obama, except for his actual deportations. Obama, hands down, still holds the deporter-in-chief record. Even if Trump had two terms, I don\\'t think he could match Obama, because he\\'s not that competent.\"\\nThe Obama administration issued several memos instructing ICE agents to use their discretion to exempt some individuals, such as long-time permanent residents and pregnant women, from enforcement and to focus on deporting immigrants with certain criminal convictions, recent border-crossers and those who reentered the U.S. after being removed. During his first week in office, Mr. Trump rescinded these Obama-era policies, broadening deportation priorities and decreeing that no undocumented immigrant would be exempt from being removed from the U.S.\\nOn the campaign trail, Biden has conceded the Obama administration \"took too long\" to retool its enforcement priorities, calling the number of deportations a \"big mistake.\" He has pledged to institute a 100-day freeze on deportations. After that, Biden would oversee a \"pretty significant adjustment\" in deportation policy and direct ICE to focus on threats to national security and those convicted of serious felonies, according to Alex, his senior adviser.\\nUnder Mr. Trump, ICE has increased its capacity to hold immigrants, expanding the world\\'s largest civil immigration detention system through contracts with for-profit prison companies and county jails. It has also confined asylum-seekers for longer periods of time, often in remote immigration jails with little oversight.\\nBiden has vowed to stop detaining asylum-seekers for the duration of their cases, and Alex said he would also end for-profit immigration detention. \"No business should profit from the suffering of desperate people fleeing violence,\" Alex said, adding that a Biden administration would expand programs that serve as alternatives to detention, like case management initiatives.\\nIf elected, Biden will also face calls from the immigrant advocacy community to discontinue family immigration detention, a practice expanded dramatically by the Obama administration in 2014, when it faced a surge in unauthorized border crossings of children and families from Central America.\\nThrough several asylum rules, the Trump administration has granted border officials the power to quickly bounce migrants off U.S. soil, effectively ending a system the president and his aides derided as \"catch and release.\"\\xa0\\nMore than 60,000 asylum-seekers were returned to Mexico and required to wait there for their U.S. court hearings. Thousands were disqualified from asylum under a new rule because they traveled through a third country to reach U.S. soil. The administration also brokered agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that allow the U.S. to re-route asylum-seekers at the southern border to those countries.\\nWhile these programs have been, for the most part, suspended during the coronavirus pandemic, the Trump administration has used a public health directive issued in March to expel tens of thousands of border-crossers, including 8,800 unaccompanied children, without allowing them to apply for asylum.\\nBiden has promised to undo Mr. Trump\\'s asylum programs, including the so-called \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, but he has yet to say whether he\\'d continue, alter or scrap the current pandemic-era border restrictions. His campaign did not respond to requests to state his position on these policies.\\nLora Ries, a former DHS official who backs the president\\'s agenda and helped implement it between 2017 and 2019, said dismantling Mr. Trump\\'s asylum policies would fuel more border-crossings. \"If you take away the consequences, it begets more illegal immigration,\" Ries, now a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told CBS News.\\nAsked how a Biden administration would deal with a surge in border crossings, Alex said it would deploy more immigration judges and asylum officers and bolster support for non-profit groups helping migrants.\\nTexas Democratic Representative Veronica Escobar, a member of the Biden-Sanders unity task force, said she expects Biden to \"lean in aggressively\" to set aside Mr. Trump\\'s asylum policies. She supports allowing asylum seekers to wait for their court hearings in the U.S., rather than Mexico, as well as the repeal of the pandemic-era expulsions policy.\\nBut Escobar said the key will be to help Central America curb the main drivers of U.S.-bound migration, including political instability, gang and generalized violence, poverty and displacement caused by climate change. Alex said Biden would commit $1 billion annually in foreign aid to the region, which Mr. Trump suspended last year before partially restoring it after Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador agreed to the \"safe-third-country\" asylum accords.\\n\"It will absolutely only become more serious of a challenge,\" Escobar told CBS News, referring to migration to the U.S. southern border. \"And mind you, these are families who don\\'t want to leave their homelands. These are individuals who are running for their lives, escaping persecution or escaping famine that is a result of the climate crisis.\"\\nIn a recent interview, Cuccinelli defended the immigration restrictions instituted by the Trump administration, saying they are necessary to curtail fraud and abuse. He said the administration is simply enforcing laws passed by Congress — something Cuccinelli called an \"almost novel\" concept.\\n\"For the first in a long time in the immigration space, we have a president who actually did what he said he was going to do. And that is so novel in this space, especially on the Republican side of the aisle,\" Cuccinelli said, adding later, \"He simply followed through on everything he said he was going to do — whether it was the wall or moving aggressively within the law to rein in illegal immigration.\"\\nMore than 300 miles of barriers have been built along the U.S.-Mexico border during Mr. Trump\\'s tenure; most of them replacing dilapidated and low barricades, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) figures.\\nTheodore Wold, one of the leading White House officials working on immigration policy, echoed Cuccinelli\\'s comments, saying Mr. Trump\\'s immigration changes could help him secure reelection and would prove durable even if Biden wins.\\n\"The overwhelming majority of the American people are committed to strengthening the American nation for the American people,\" Wold, a deputy assistant to the president for domestic policy, told CBS News. \"The Left\\'s rallying cry of \\'no borders, no walls\\' is really just short-hand for more drug violence, more human trafficking, more intergenerational poverty and, ultimately, fewer jobs and fewer opportunities for American workers.\"\\nTrump campaign spokesperson Samantha Zager said the president will win in November because he has \"effectively delivered\" on his immigration promises.\\nDespite the numerous restrictions enacted during his presidency, Cuccinelli said Mr. Trump should still be seen as a supporter of immigration. \"As tough as this president is on illegal immigration, and as sensitive as he is to protecting American workers, he\\'s also fulsomely supportive of making sure our legal immigration system is firing on all cylinders,\" Cuccinelli said.\\nSeveral Trump administration policies have limited forms of legal immigration by making it harder for immigrants to obtain green cards, asylum and refugee status. The public charge rules, for one, give immigration and consular officials more power to deny permanent residency and visas to applicants the government determines rely — or could rely — on public benefits, like food stamps, housing vouchers and forms of Medicaid.\\nThe refugee ceiling, which Mr. Obama set at 110,000 spots before leaving office, has been slashed dramatically by Mr. Trump, who set the current 18,000-person cap. With roughly 11,000 admissions, the U.S. is on track to take in the fewest number of refugees in modern\\xa0history this fiscal year, which ends Wednesday.\\nCiting the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Trump has also issued proclamations limiting immigrant visas and guest worker programs.\\nBiden has said he will halt the public charge rules and set a refugee cap of 125,000 spots during his first year in office — a promise experts said is a lofty objective. \"It\\'s not possible,\" a former senior DHS official who requested anonymity to speak freely told CBS News. \"The volunteer agencies that handle the resettlement once someone gets here, their infrastructure has been devastated. They don\\'t have the people to handle that kind of population.\"\\xa0\\nCuccinelli said his administration\\'s definition of \"public charge\" conforms with the intent Congress had when it codified the standard in 1882, the same year it instituted an absolute ban on Chinese immigrants. The cuts to the refugee ceiling, Cuccinelli added, do not reflect the overall picture of the administration\\'s work on humanitarian immigration.\\n\"If you add refugees and asylees that come into our country, we are far and away the most generous country in the world year after year after year — including with the most recent refugee numerical cap,\" he said.\\nBiden has pledged to work with Congress on legislation that puts DACA recipients and the rest of the country\\'s estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants on a pathway to U.S. citizenship.\\xa0\\nBut he would need to muster enough support in a Congress that has failed to compromise on comprehensive immigration bills for more than a decade and that could continue to be divided come January 2021. Like Mr. Trump, Biden is likely to take executive action to implement immigration policy, including programs to shield \"Dreamers\" and other immigrants from deportation, experts said.\\nFormer DHS officials cautioned that a Biden administration\\'s immigration actions would likely face legal challenges and could also be hampered by federal courts — which have blocked many of Mr. Trump\\'s policies. Cuccinelli said that could happen but stressed that he believes unfavorable judicial rulings tend to go in a \"one-way streak.\"\\n\"There are no conservative activist judges in any serious numbers, not like the left-wing judges we\\'re seeing making war on this president,\" Cuccinelli said.\\nWith the help of the GOP-led Senate, however, Mr. Trump has installed more than 200 conservative federal judges, cementing a center-right shift in the American judiciary and reshaping the balance of power of key courts, like the once reliably liberal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. With the recent passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Mr. Trump also has an opportunity to appoint his third Supreme Court justice and transform the high court into a solidly conservative institution for a generation.\\xa0\\nIn the past year, Mr. Trump\\'s judicial appointments have sided with him in rulings allowing the administration to implement, among other measures, the public charge rule, broad asylum restrictions for border-crossers and the termination of deportation protections for roughly 400,0000 immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for years.\\nRies, the former DHS official, said a second Trump term could allow the administration to prioritize employment-based over family-based immigration and to end birthright citizenship, an effort targeting the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants that some legal experts say would violate the Constitution.\\n\"Ending birthright citizenship is more of an executive action. It\\'s an interpretation of the 14th Amendment. It\\'s been wrongly interpreted to this point,\" Ries said. \"Getting to a more merit-based immigration system would require Congress.\"\\nFour more years would also give the Trump administration a second opportunity to end the DACA program, as well as more time to implement proposed rules to further limit who qualifies for U.S. asylum, a regulation to detain migrant families indefinitely and restrictions on temporary work visas.\\nValdés, the co-executive director of Make the Road Action, said he worries Mr. Trump\\'s re-election could be portrayed as a vindication of his administration\\'s hard-line immigration agenda.\\xa0\\n\"Trump has declared an outright war against our communities, and he will then feel emboldened to go further, to go after our communities,\" Valdés said. \"That\\'s a big concern for all of us, that he could feel that, in many ways, the policies that he\\'s been pushing have the support of the general public.\"\\nNicole Sganga and Fin Gomez contributed to this report.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'The 1968 Fair Housing Act outlawed redlining nationwide. But the disastrous effects of the discriminatory practice are still contributing to today\\'s wealth gap between Black and White Americans.\\n\"I think you see it in every city in America,\" Atlanta councilman Amir Farokhi told CBS News\\' Michelle Miller. \"This is where the basis of segregated neighborhoods remains to this day.\"\\nFarokhi represents a divided district in Atlanta — half the area is enjoying the bloom of reinvestment, while the other is still blighted.\\xa0\\n\"We can draw a line kind of northwest to southeast, and most of the neighborhoods above that line are predominantly White and most beneath it are predominantly Black,\" he said. \"You are still living with generational divide and the wealth gap that happens because of that.\"\\nThe federal government began the practice of redlining in the 1930s, outlining areas deemed \"hazardous\" — often home to sizable Black, minority and immigrant populations. Based on that, mortgage lenders would deny loans to low-income minorities in those neighborhoods, causing disinvestment and placing home ownership out of reach for people of color.\\nAtlanta resident Kimberly Alexander said her family saw the inequity unfold firsthand along the city\\'s Auburn Avenue.\\xa0\\n\"It was everything,\" she said of the predominantly-Black area. \"It was Black excellence. It was Black commerce.\"\\nIn its heyday a century ago, Alexander\\'s family business was a fixture there, until the area — and the country itself — began changing.\\n\"There was a period of time after desegregation where businesses shuttered and left because they had opportunity elsewhere,\" Alexander said. \"And some people thought the grass was greener on the other side. And so unfortunately that left a lot of buildings plighted and the area plighted.\"\\nThus, the community was redlined.\\xa0\\nMany neighborhoods that were redlined like Auburn Avenue, deemed \"hazardous,\" are still more likely than others to consist of lower-income, minority residents.\\nIn 2016, the median net worth of Black households was about $17,000. The median net worth of White households was $171,000 — about ten times more.\\xa0\\nAtlanta officials have pushed projects like \"Invest Atlanta\" to revitalize distressed areas, and other community leaders are stepping up to help close the gap left by redlining.\\n\"The houses that you see in this neighborhood were either vacant lots or just dilapidated,\" Historic District Development Corporation head Chenee Joseph said. \"And so within 40 years HDDC alone has built or re-habbed about 121 single family homes. We\\'ve built about 500 units.\"\\nThe grassroots organization was founded by Coretta Scott King and other civil rights leaders to preserve the nearby Martin Luther King, Jr. historic corridor. In addition to revitalizing family homes, HDDC has also rehabilitated 40,000 square feet of commercial space.\\xa0\\nHowever, the growth came with its own challenges — a majority of affordable housing in the area is owned by nonprofits and churches, so the HDDC cannot easily profit off its investments.\\n\"We\\'ve basically had to create something out of nothing,\" Joseph said. \"To be able to do that almost single-handedly is an accomplishment that we don\\'t take lightly.\"\\nThe group is looking to expand its mission in the near future, as Joseph demonstrated with plans of future Auburn Avenue projects.\\n\"You\\'re looking at about half a billion dollars of redevelopment,\" she said.\\nShe said the plan would be a good investment, despite the hefty sum.\\xa0\\n\"You\\'re working with stakeholders that already own their properties. So you\\'re not having to deal with acquisition. But more importantly, what you\\'re doing is you\\'re reinvesting into your community that\\'s going to continue to prosper time and time again,\" she explained.\\nDespite the practice being illegal, Black loan applicants are still turned away by banks at a higher rate than White applicants. The widespread use of redlining has allowed generations of White Americans to build wealth through equity in homes and businesses, further widening a wealth gap African Americans have yet to rebound from.\\nAnother person trying to reverse the trend is Chicago native and real estate developer Lamell McMorris, who is working to revitalize neighborhoods without completely gentrifying them or pricing out long-term residents — he calls the practice \"greenlining.\"\\n\"I want to make greenlining about neighborhood reinvestment and neighborhood redevelopment,\" McMorris said. \"I\\'m going to try to make a difference here.\"\\nIn June, McMorris\\' firm Greenlining Realty USA partnered with a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit to build and rehabilitate residential properties in Chicago\\'s Woodlawn neighborhood.\\nHe acquired vacant, abandoned and tax delinquent properties and sells them at below market rates to buyers who must be community-based developers.

Calls for a new migrant caravan to leave from the San Pedro Sula bus station October 1 had been circulating on social media for weeks. \\nThe caravan comes just two weeks after Guatemala reopened its borders after keeping them sealed for months to slow the spread of COVID-19. \\nBut the majority of the migrants who gathered Wednesday decided not to wait for October, instead setting out in the dark of night carrying knapsacks and many wearing masks.\\xa0\\nThe groups quickly strung out along the highway with some catching rides while others continued to walk toward the Guatemala border.\\nLate Wednesday, Guatemala\\'s immigration agency said in a statement that its counterpart in Honduras said about 900 migrants were in the city of Choloma and were headed to the border crossing at Corinto. \\nGovernments throughout the region made it known they were watching Wednesday. Mexico\\'s immigration agency said in a statement that it would enforce \"safe, orderly and legal\" migration and not do anything to promote the formation of a migrant caravan. The U.S. Embassy in Honduras said via Twitter Wednesday that migration to the U.S. was more difficult than ever right now and more dangerous because of COVID-19.\\nBut the push factors driving migrants from Central America certainly haven\\'t eased during the pandemic. The lack of jobs and struggle for families to put food on the table have only worsened.\\nThe U.N.\\'s International Labour Organization said Wednesday that at least 34 million jobs have been lost in Latin America due to the coronavirus pandemic. The ILO lists Latin America and the Caribbean as the worst-hit region in the world in terms of lost working hours, with a drop of 20.9% in the first three quarters of the year.\\nThe flow of migrants north from Central America had slowed dramatically during the pandemic as countries throughout the region closed their borders. Most migrant shelters along the principle routes north through Mexico closed their doors to new arrivals as they tried to keep the virus from spreading to vulnerable migrant populations. Mexico and the United States deported hundreds of migrants back to their home countries to try to empty detention centers.\\nThe U.S. government used the pandemic to effectively shut down the asylum system at its southern border, but as CBS News immigration reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez reported in early September, apprehensions of unauthorized migrants along the southern border rose for a fourth consecutive month in August, with U.S. immigration authorities making nearly 50,000 arrests and expelling the majority of those apprehended under coronavirus restrictions.\\xa0\\nMore than 43,000 of the apprehensions during August resulted in summary expulsions, which U.S. border authorities were authorized to make during the coronavirus pandemic, according to\\xa0Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data. More expulsions were made in August than in any other month since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an order in mid-March green-lighting them.\\nThe arrests recorded by CBP — the main metric used to gauge border crossings — show unauthorized migration to the U.S. continued to increase over the summer, despite the pandemic and the Trump administration\\'s policy of swiftly expelling most migrants, including asylum-seekers and unaccompanied children, without allowing them to seek humanitarian refuge.\\xa0 \\nMexico has tried for months to bus asylum seekers stuck at its northern border south. Mexico has typically offered migrants the opportunity to seek asylum there, but many have their minds set on the United States. \\nMigrants are also likely to find it more difficult to find work in Mexico now as the economy is expected to contract 10% this year due to the impact of the pandemic.\\nThe departure of the group Wednesday night was reminiscent of a much larger migrant caravan that formed two years ago shortly before U.S. midterm elections. It became a hot issue in the campaign, fueling anti-immigrant rhetoric. \\nUnder pressure from the U.S. government last year, Mexico took a more aggressive approach toward migrants. It deployed its National Guard to intercept them on highways and worked to keep massive caravans seen in previous years from forming.\\nCentral American migrants began travelling in large groups in recent years, seeking safety in numbers and in some cases avoiding the cost of smugglers. They drew significant attention, but were a fraction of the everyday migration flow toward the U.S. border.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'First Lady Melania Trump downplayed her husband, President Trump\\'s family separation policy\\xa0and complained about Christmas planning in an expletive-filled secret recording aired by CNN.\\xa0\\nThe leaked audio from June 2018 was secretly recorded by Mrs. Trump\\'s former senior adviser and friend Stephanie Winston Wolkoff. In the audio, Trump discusses her frustration with the criticism of the family separation policy and also complains about preparing for Christmas at the White House, a duty traditionally carried out by the first lady. CBS News has not independently verified the recordings.\\xa0\\n\"I\\'m working ... my a** off on the Christmas stuff, that you know, who gives a f*** about the Christmas stuff and decorations? But I need to do it, right?\" she said.\\xa0\\n\"The jacket was... a publicity stunt, and it was to garner the attention of the press, to make sure that everyone was aware that Melania was going to the border.\"\\nMelania Trump\\'s former friend, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, on the infamous \"I really don\\'t care. Do U?\" jacket. pic.twitter.com/sCJAAAcvBf\\n\"OK, and then I do it and I say that I\\'m working on Christmas and planning for the Christmas and they said, \\'Oh, what about the children that they were separated?\" she added. \"Give me a f****** break. Were they were saying anything when Obama did that? I can not go, I was trying get the kid reunited with the mom. I didn\\'t have a chance -- needs to go through the process and through the law.\"\\nFamily separations under former president Barack Obama were rare and happened when immigration officials determined parents posed a risk to their children. During Mr. Trump\\'s \"zero tolerance\" policy, thousands of parents and children who crossed the border illegally were separated over a span of months, but the practice was discontinued after massive public outcry and a federal judge ruling. In 2018, during a trip to a detention center housing immigrant children in Texas, Mrs. Trump\\xa0prompted backlash\\xa0after she wore a green jacket that read: \"I REALLY DON\\'T CARE, DO U?\"\\nWolkoff, the woman who made the recordings, told CNN the jacket was a \"publicity stunt.\"\\xa0\\n\"It was to garner the attention of the press, to make sure everyone was aware that Melania was going to the border,\" she said.\\nIn a separate recording, Mrs. Trump voices support for the treatment of children at Border Patrol detention centers, suggesting the facilities were better than what they had at home. The first lady discussed conditions migrant children faced in the U.S. after being brought in by \"coyotes.\"  \\n\"The kids, they say, \\'Wow I will have my own bed? I will sleep on the bed? I will have a cabinet for my clothes?\\' It\\'s so sad to hear it, but they didn\\'t have that in their own countries, they sleep on the floor,\" she said. \"They are taken care of nicely there. But you know, yeah, they are not with parents, it\\'s sad. But when they come here alone or with coyotes or illegally, you know, you need to do something.\"\\nShe also claimed that migrants looking to gain entry in the U.S. were being coached to say certain things.\\n\"Some of them are using that lines, that they\\'re not professional, but they\\'re teached by other people – what to say to come over and to, you know, to let them to to stay here,\" Trump said.\\xa0\\nWolkoff released a book last month about her relationship with the first lady called \"Melania and Me: The Rise and Fall of My Friendship with the First Lady,\" which is published by Simon and Schuster, part of the ViacomCBS. \\xa0\\nIn a statement to CBS News, the first lady\\'s chief of staff Stephanie Grisham criticized the recordings by Wolkoff.\\xa0\\n\"Her only intent was to secretly tape the First Lady in order to peddle herself and her salacious book,\" Grisham said. \"There is no way to know if these recordings have been edited and it\\'s clear the clips were hand-picked and presented with no context.

       "  'body': 'There are still more people registered as Democrats than Republicans in the battleground states of Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, but Republicans have been gaining ground. There are multiple forces at play, according to\\xa0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\\xa0and\\xa0campaign reporter Zak Hudak: Republicans are making strides with registering voters, the two-party system is losing its appeal -- especially with young people -- and Democrats are being purged from the rolls as they either move out of those states or aren\\'t showing up at the polls.\\n\"The people who have been removed from the file since [2016] are more Democrats than Republicans,\" said Tom Bonier, CEO of TargetSmart, a nonprofit politics data firm. \"Overwhelmingly, those people didn\\'t vote in 2016. What that tells you is these are people who had already either moved from the state or already died prior to November 2016, and they just hadn\\'t been removed at that point.\"\\nThe latest\\xa0national CBS News Battleground Tracker\\xa0poll shows Joe Biden with a 10-point lead among likely voters, but that lead narrows to within the margin of error in several key states, meaning the race could come down to who shows up at the polls on or before Election Day. Both the Trump and Biden campaigns are actively working to boost their party registration numbers.With early October\\xa0voter registration deadlines\\xa0looming in many states, Democrats\\' advantage has narrowed.\\nRead what is factoring into the shifts and what it all means\\xa0here.\\nOne day after the Commission on Presidential Debates announced plans to add \"additional structure\" to future debates, President Trump fired back on Twitter. \"Why would I allow the Debate Commission to change the rules for the second and third Debates when I easily won last time?\" the\\xa0president tweeted. On a call with reporters on Thursday, Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller stressed, \"There should not be any changes to what\\'s been agreed to\" in forthcoming match-ups,\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\\xa0reports. Miller said the president \"fully plans on participating in and winning both the second and third debates in the presidential contest here.\" Max Miller - the Trump campaign\\'s representative at the debate negotiating table - alleged the Biden campaign requested several new changes to the debate format: Opening and closing statements, cut down on open discussion and a mute button. Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien told reporters \"negotiations occur between the two campaigns and the two campaigns agree to format and specifics regarding the forum.\" The campaign manager said he hopes the Commission on Presidential Debates would not unilaterally impose the new changes during the second debate.\\nMeanwhile, at a campaign stop in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Vice President Mike Pence said he\\'s looking forward to next week\\'s only vice-presidential debate of the campaign cycle. Pence said he will make the Trump Administration\\'s case to the American people and take the fight to the Biden-Harris agenda. Iowa, a likely battleground in this year\\'s presidential election, is also the state that goes first in the presidential primary of...2024. While the 2020 election is less than five weeks away,\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\\xa0reports this is Pence\\'s fifth trip to Iowa this year, and recent appearances in the first-in-the-nation caucus state from the several high profile Republicans, is already fueling speculation about the party\\'s potential standard bearer in a post-Trump presidency. \"Mike Pence is going to be on the A-list of potential contenders,\" one senior Iowa Republican official said ahead of the vice president\\'s visit. Other top name Republicans like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo; former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley; Senators Tom Cotton, Tim Scott and James Lankford; South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem; and Representatives Ben Sasse and Dan Crenshaw, have all visited Iowa in recent months.\\xa0Click\\xa0here\\xa0to read more about how the 2024 Republican primary is already taking shape.\\nAfter primarily holding virtual organizing and virtual campaign events due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Democratic nominee Joe Biden\\'s campaign will launch in person canvassing and door knocking with a little over a month until the general election, report\\xa0CBS News campaign reporters\\xa0Jack Turman,\\xa0Alex Tin\\xa0and\\xa0Adam Brewster. The move represents a slight shift for the Biden campaign and Democrats at the national level who were critical of Mr. Trump\\'s campaign holding in person organizing events. In-person operations will begin over the next week in several battleground states, including New Hampshire, Nevada, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Several hundred volunteers will be canvassing this week and conversations will focus on voter education, according to a senior Biden official. In addition to in-person canvassing and door knocking, supply centers, which will be used to distribute yard signs, will open. Volunteers will be trained with COVID-19 safety measures and will be provided personal protective equipment. \"Our volunteers are fired up and have exceeded every goal we\\'ve set,\" Biden campaign manager Jen O\\'Malley Dillon said in a statement. \"We\\'re now expanding on our strategy in a targeted way that puts the safety of communities first and foremost and helps us mobilize voters who are harder to reach by phone now that we\\'re in the final stretch and now that Americans are fully dialed-in and ready to make their voices heard.\"\\nBiden was also asked about new potential debate rules today following the first presidential match-up earlier in the week, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson. The former VP once again committed to the upcoming debates and seemed to note that he was not completely opposed to a mute function as long as candidates had the answer to fully answer questions from the moderator. Earlier in the day when asked about the Trump campaign claiming that the Biden campaign supposedly requested cutting of the candidates\\' audio, Biden spokesman Andrew Bates said, \"There\\'s as much truth to this as the other weak lies the Trump campaign told in advance of the first debate -- before Donald Trump exposed his own record on the pandemic as a failure, told violent white supremacists to \\'stand by,\\' and cratered. From a place of equivalent seriousness, we understand that the Trump campaign insisted Donald Trump be four inches taller for the next debate, and that he exclusively take questions from active 4Chan users - none of which could be about the coronavirus.\"\\nLuzerne County was one of three longtime Democratic strongholds in the state that Mr. Trump won over in 2016, and it\\'s a good example of working class white Democrats propelling Mr. Trump to victory in that election, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. It was once part of a booming mining and manufacturing region, but the majority of the coal mines and factories there closed by the late 20th century. It now has a growing immigrant population and has gained some jobs in warehousing. But those forces coupled with distrust of government after the 2008 \"kids for cash\" scandal helped Mr. Trump resonate with longtime Democrats there. The vote swing from the prior election there was over half the total number of votes Mr. Trump won the state by. Democrats still outnumber Republicans by over 13,000 there, but they\\'ve have slightly lost their voter registration edge since the 2016 election. The county is in many ways representative of the area that surrounds it in the Northeastern part of the state. Neighboring Lackawanna County, where Biden spent his early childhood in Scranton, also saw major shifts in 2016. Barack Obama won it by 27 points in 2012, but Mr. Trump came within 3.5 points of Hillary Clinton there in 2016.\\nInitial jobless applications dipped last week but stayed elevated, signaling that the job market remains weak nearly seven months after the\\xa0coronavirus\\xa0hit the U.S. About 837,000 Americans applied for state unemployment benefits in the week ending September 26, the Labor Department\\xa0said\\xa0Thursday. Adjusted for seasonal variation,\\xa0CBS News digital data reporter Irina Ivanova\\xa0reports\\xa0that represents a drop of 36,000 from\\xa0the previous week. Another 650,000 people applied for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a federal program for the self-employed and gig workers. \"Overall, filings are stuck at a high level,\" Rubeela Farooqi of High Frequency Economics said in a note to investors. \"Layoff announcements are also ongoing. Even as jobs are being recovered job losses are mounting, indicative of continuing strains in the labor market.\" Job cuts announced in September were more than triple their 2019 level, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Large employers this week continued to announce job cuts.\\xa0Disney\\xa0said it would cut 28,000 jobs in its California amusement parks. Two airlines, United and American, said late Wednesday they would\\xa0furlough 32,000\\xa0workers unless Congress came through with a rescue deal in the next few days. Insurance company Allstate is laying off 3,800\\xa0employees. \"All of the data point to evidence that there\\'s still a very high, steady stream of layoffs,\" Julia Pollak, labor economist at ZipRecruiter, said this week. \"Employers who\\'ve held on and thought they could recover in a few months, they\\'ve been disappointed in the return of customers, and they\\'re now choosing to close.\" Thursday\\'s jobless claims figures come with a caveat. California, the state with the largest labor force, has\\xa0frozen applications for two weeks\\xa0while it works to root out fraud in the system. The economy has recovered only about half of the 22 million jobs that have been lost during the pandemic. And millions of Americans are facing unemployment with diminished government aid since the expiration of a $600-a-week federal benefit this summer. The Labor Department is set to release employment figures for September on Friday. Economists expect to see about 850,000 jobs added, the third month of decreasing job gains.\\nLiving United for Change in Arizona, a prominent progressive Latino activism group in Arizona, announced this week an \"unprecedented\" $2 million investment in reaching \"infrequent\" voters of color in the battleground. The organization, which traces its roots to the fight over a controversial state attempt to curb undocumented immigration in 2010, numbers among several groups hoping to boost Democrats\\' chances in flipping the state with Arizona\\'s booming Latino communities. Of the battleground states,\\xa0Latinos are estimated\\xa0to make up a larger share of eligible voters in Arizona (24%) than any other state except Texas (30%). \"We are so close to flipping AZ blue, and we are going to do everything we can to make that happen in the biggest election of our lifetime,\" LUCHA\\'s César Fierros said in an email.\\nAlso in Arizona, Biden and Kamala Harris are scheduled to hit the campaign trail together there next week as the battleground state kicks off early voting, according to a Bloomberg report.\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\\xa0reports the visit would mark the former vice president\\'s first stop in Arizona of the year, after an initial visit for a debate during the primary season was cancelled in the early months of the coronavirus pandemic. The president also plans to return to the state, his campaign announcing Thursday events in Tucson and Flagstaff next week for his sixth Arizona visit of the year.\\nNearly 85% of all eligible voters in California are registered to vote in the November election, the highest percentage heading into a General Election in 68 years, according to Secretary of State Alex Padilla.\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\\xa0reports the latest numbers show that more than 21.2 million Californians were registered to vote as of September 4, 2020. That is an increase of nearly 3 million new registered voters compared to the same time in 2016. \"Despite this huge increase, there\\'s still more work to be done. For those who have registered, the next step is making a plan to vote.\" California will begin sending out vote by mail ballots starting on Monday to all registered voters. The latest numbers show more than 9.8 million registered Democrats in the state, up from 8.2 million in 2016. Republicans have slight more than 5.1 million registered voters but have only gained roughly 300,000 new voters in the last four years. Meanwhile, No Party Preference voters, which pulled ahead of Republicans during the summer report, are now back in third place with slightly more than 5 million registered voters. Their numbers however have increased by nearly 800,000 registered voters since 2016. The traditional deadline to register to vote in the November election is coming up on October 19. If an eligible Californian misses that deadline, they can complete the same day voter registration process at county elections offices or in-person voting centers.\\nConservative activists Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman are facing felony charges in Michigan for allegedly orchestrating a series of robocalls aimed at suppressing the vote in November general election, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced on Thursday. According to\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster, Nessel said Wohl and Burkman each face four felony counts, including conspiracy to intimidate voters, which could lead to spending years in prison. The two conservative operatives have a history of staging hoaxes and making false claims. Back in August, Nessel and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson released a recording of the robocall in August and said it was aimed at suppressing Black voters by using \"racially-charged stereotypes to deter voting by mail.\" In a statement, Nessel said \"any effort to interfere with, intimidate or intentionally mislead Michigan voters will be met with swift and severe consequences.\" The statement added that \"this effort specifically targeted minority voters in an attempt to deter them from voting in the November election.\" The calls were made in late August and reached nearly 12,000 residents with phone numbers with 313 area codes, which is Detroit\\'s area code, Nessel said. Attorneys general in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois all reported similar robocalls in their state. It\\'s believed around 85,000 calls were made nationally, but there was not an exact breakdown of the number of calls in each city or state. \"I have zero tolerance for anyone who would seek to deceive citizens about their right to vote,\" Benson said in a statement. \"I am grateful to the Attorney General for her swift and thorough investigation, putting anyone else who would seek to undermine citizens\\' fundamental rights on notice that we will use every tool at our disposal to dispel false rhetoric and seek justice on behalf of every voter who is targeted and harmed by any attempt to suppress their vote.\" In August, Wohl told\\xa0The Daily Beast\\xa0he was \"not aware of\" any robocalls and Burkman told the Beast \"we have no connection to any such robocalls.\"\\nNevada Attorney General Aaron Ford on Twitter earlier this week warned Mr. Trump that \"voter intimidation is illegal in Nevada\" following the president\\'s plea the president\\'s plea at the first presidential debate for \"supporters to go into polls and watch very carefully\" for voter fraud. State GOP chair Michael McDonald responded in a statement that \"our team will be out in full force protecting Nevada\\'s right to a fair election and we hope that Attorney General Ford and Democrats would do the same.\"\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\\xa0reports a spokesperson for the attorney general said past voter intimidation cases were rare in Nevada, adding that most charges over the election tended to be \"voter registration related, such as throwing voter\\'s registrations away.\"\\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott issued an order on Thursday that mail ballots delivered in-person by voters have to be delivered to a single clerk\\'s office in a county, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The change is set to go into effect on Friday. That means counties can no longer set up satellite locations for returning mail ballots, as some counties have. The order also requires clerks to allow poll watchers to observe any activity at the early voting clerk\\'s office where mail ballots are being delivered. Texas has strict restrictions on who can vote by mail. To vote by mail, you must be either 65 years or older, disabled, out of the county on Election Day and early voting period or be in jail but otherwise eligible to vote. \"The State of Texas has a duty to voters to maintain the integrity of our elections,\" Abbott said in a statement. \"As we work to preserve Texans\\' ability to vote during the COVID-19 pandemic, we must take extra care to strengthen ballot security protocols throughout the state. These enhanced security protocols will ensure greater transparency and will help stop attempts at illegal voting.\" Democrats blasted Abbott\\'s decision. \"Republicans are on the verge of losing, so Governor Abbott is trying to adjust the rules last minute,\" Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement. \"Courts all over the country, including the Fifth Circuit yesterday, have held that it is too late to change election rules, but our failed Republican leadership will try anyway. Make no mistake, Democracy itself is on the ballot. Every Texan must get out and vote these cowards out!\" Texas expanded the early in-person voting period this election. It begins on October 13.\\nMr. Trump relocated one of his planned Saturday rallies in Wisconsin, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The president was scheduled to hold an afternoon rally in La Crosse, a city that has been hit hard by COVID-19 over the past couple of weeks, but it was moved to Janesville on Thursday afternoon. The mayor of La Crosse asked Mr. Trump to cancel or postpone his rally earlier on Thursday. A Trump campaign official said there was an issue with the lease and the move was not related to COVID, according to\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. Mr. Trump is still holding an evening rally in Green Bay on Saturday night, where cases have been increasing the past couple of weeks. According to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, more than 80% of hospital and ICU beds are being used in northeast Wisconsin.\\nAlso in the Badger State, the top elections official said there were no Wisconsin ballots in trays of mail that were found in a ditch in the northeastern part of the state last week, reports\\xa0Brewster.\\xa0\"No Wisconsin ballots were part of what was found. No Wisconsin ballots were involved or impacted by that incident. We also learned from the United States Postal Service that they are conducting a full investigation about why there was mail found in a ditch as it was reported in Outagamie County,\" said Wisconsin Elections Commission Administrator Meagan Wolfe. However, Wolfe said she wasn\\'t sure what pieces of mail were found and if that included any other states\\' ballots. The Outagamie County Sheriff\\'s office told the\\xa0Appleton Post-Crescent\\xa0that there were \"several\" absentee ballots found. 395,082 Wisconsinites have returned absentee ballots so far, about 11% of the state\\'s registered voters. More than 1.2 million absentee ballots have been requested.\\nQANON\\nDemocratic Congressman Tom Malinowski of New Jersey has received at least 12 explicit death threats from QAnon supporters after a misleading ad from the National Republican Congressional Committee was shared amongst followers in a \"Q Drop\" on Tuesday. Malinowski\\'s House office says they\\'ve been in contact with Capitol Police and have received hundreds of other threatening messages over social media, phone calls and email. The ad itself says Malinowski lobbied to \"protect sexual predators,\" referencing his background as a lobbyist for the Human Rights Watch organization.\\xa0QAnon\\xa0is a conspiracy theory network that believe there\\'s a band of pedophiles and Democratic politicians running a child sex trafficking ring, and that Mr. Trump will expose them. In response, the NRCC has repeatedly been\\xa0pointing to this form\\xa0listing Malinowski\\'s name along with all the lobbying issues the firm worked on, including sex offender legislation. Both Malinowski and Jennifer Daskal, also listed on the form as a lobbyist,\\xa0have told\\xa0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\\xa0he had no role on domestic issues. In 2006, the organization was lobbying against a crime bill that had provisions related to expanding who would be on the national sex offender registry. \"Those I did independently of him, and did not consult or work with him on,\" Daskal previously said. The campaign of Malinowski\\'s GOP opponent, Thomas Kean Jr., condemned the death threats but said the blame should not be placed on them. \"The facts are that Congressman Malinowski boasts about Human Rights Watch having won a Nobel Prize before he worked there, but he is refusing to take accountability for the organization\\'s efforts while he was the Washington Director,\" campaign consultant Harrison Neely said.\\xa0\\nLocal Republicans have\\xa0said before that the ad\\xa0should be taken down. In a statement on Wednesday, the NRCC wrote \"the only person who bears responsibility here is Tom Malinowski for his decision to lobby against the creation of a national sex offender registry... And now Congressman Malinowski must live with the consequences of his actions.\" In late August, Malinowski officially introduced a resolution condemning QAnon. One of the voicemail threats takes specific issue with the resolution, and says, \"When this is all done, people like you, if you\\'re not rotting in a prison somewhere you\\'ll never be safe on the streets. Mark my words.\" So far the bill has three Republican\\xa0cosponsors: Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Denver Riggleman of Virginia. Riggleman, who was\\xa0defeated in a \"drive thru\" convention process\\xa0earlier this summer, told\\xa0Navarro\\xa0he has been getting his own threats from QAnon followers. \"I talked to [Malinowski] about it, we\\'re to a point that we really have got to stop the fringes from dictating our debate,\" he said. Riggleman said he has not talked to NRCC Chair Tom Emmer about the ad but said they should consider taking it down. \"If you\\'re fact checked, you know, those things aren\\'t happening, aren\\'t true at this point, and that is leading to death threats because of the perfect storm we\\'re in right now with conspiracy theories and tribalism in politics - I think you got to consider taking those ads down,\" he said.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris are\\xa0meeting on Wednesday evening\\xa0in Salt Lake City, Utah, for the sole vice presidential debate, which will be moderated by USA Today Washington bureau chief Susan Page. The coronavirus pandemic is likely to be the top issue of the evening, especially since President Trump\\xa0tested positive for COVID-19 last week. Safety measures have been put in place for the debate at the University of Utah.\\xa0Here\\'s more\\xa0on what to watch for\\xa0Wednesday night at 9 p.m\\xa0by\\xa0CBS News digital reporters Grace Segers\\xa0and\\xa0Audrey\\xa0McNamara.\\nPence participated in three separate 90-minute practice sessions ahead of the debate, according to a senior White House official. Trump campaign advisor and former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi - who has been helping Pence prepare for today\\'s debate by playing Harris - called the U.S. senator from California \"a great debater\" on Fox News, Wednesday. \"I know Kamala. She\\'s smart. She\\'s articulate. She is very tough,\" Bondi said. Asked how Pence plans to defend his record as leader of the White House coronavirus task force, Bondi said she had not spoken directly with the vice president about it, but added: \"Off the top of my head, what I would say is, well, you\\'re the one that called us xenophobic for wanting to shut down China\\'s entry. You\\'re the one who wants open borders, so people can just flow into this country with diseases, with human trafficking, with drugs. So I mean, there\\'s plenty to come back.\"\\nDuring a phone call with reporters ahead of the debate, Harris\\' communications director Liz Allen said, \"Senator Harris will be on stage with Mike Pence,\" but added, \"this debate is really about Trump\\'s failed leadership.\" Members of Harris\\' team signaled that the senator from California will lean in heavily on the Trump administration\\'s handling of the coronavirus pandemic as the vice president himself is the head of the White House COVID-19 task force, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry. Biden campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders did stress to reporters that they are expecting Pence to have a good night. Sanders said Pence has a \"history\" of being a successful debater and they do not see Wednesday night as an exception.\\nMembers of Harris\\' team were asked about any concerns they might have about any potential exposure to COVID-19 that Harris might face herself while on stage, especially as Harris is set to return to the campaign trail tomorrow with an appearance with her running mate Joe Biden in Arizona. Both Sanders and Allen said their team and Harris will continue to follow the guidelines set by the Cleveland Clinic and the Commission on Presidential Debates.\\nPence has agreed to a plexiglass barrier on his side of the debate stage after earlier objections to the separation,\\xa0Perry\\xa0and\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter\\xa0Nicole\\xa0Sganga\\xa0report. The concession from representatives of the Trump-Pence campaign came after\\xa0wrangling over whether plexiglass was needed\\xa0on Pence\\'s side of the stage. Despite the extra COVID-19 safety measures in place, one doctor is questioning whether that will be enough as the virus outbreak at the White House continues to grow. \"More layers of protection are so important,\" Dr. Neeta Ogden said on\\xa0CBSN\\xa0Wednesday. \"It\\'s not just Pence, it\\'s the team that he\\'s traveling with, it\\'s the exposure on a daily basis.\"\\nThe vice president\\'s physician announced that Pence took a PCR coronavirus test Tuesday afternoon that came back negative. And the White House said Pence and his wife both tested negative again Wednesday in Salt Lake City, where the debate is being held. But as Ogden points out, test results only reflect a specific moment in time and don\\'t guarantee an infection won\\'t develop later. \"Just because he\\'s had a daily antigen test, intermittent PCR tests, is meaningless if he continues to interact with other people on his team or anybody else in the world -- we don\\'t know what their COVID status is,\" she said.\\xa0Sganga\\xa0and\\xa0CBS News White House producer Sara Cooke\\xa0report the Trump campaign has not learned of any additional positive coronavirus tests within their ranks since Friday night, when the president\\'s campaign manager Bill Stepien announced he tested positive for the virus. The president\\'s sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and daughter-in-law Lara Trump tested negative on Monday for COVID-19.\\nMr. Trump returned to the Oval Office on Wednesday, a White House spokesperson confirmed to\\xa0CBS News White House producer Gaby Ake. White House deputy press secretary Brian Morgenstern told the TV pool the president was briefed on ongoing coronavirus stimulus talks and Hurricane Delta. Morgenstern told reporters on Wednesday that it\\'s not possible to uncover the source of Mr. Trump\\'s coronavirus infection,\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\\xa0reports. \"I understand people are very curious about that. I\\'m curious too. But that\\'s not really what contact tracing does. And the fact is, it could be any number of sources,\" Morgenstern said. \"It\\'s sort of an unknowable question as to where it entered the environment. Conley, the president\\'s physician, has repeatedly declined to provide specifics about the president\\'s lung condition or the last time Mr. Trump tested negative for the virus, citing federal privacy laws. On Monday afternoon, Conley released a new memo providing an update on Mr. Trump\\'s health. \"The president this morning says \\'I feel great!\\'\" wrote Conley, who has been leading the president\\'s care. \"His physical exam and vital signs, including oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, all remain stable and in normal range.\" Conley said Mr. Trump has been fever-free for four days and has not shown any symptoms for over 24 hours, adding that the president \"has not needed nor received any supplemental oxygen since initial hospitalization.\" He also said tests on Monday showed the president has \"detectable levels\" of coronavirus antibodies, an improvement from last Thursday, when antibodies were undetectable. Mr. Trump received a dose of an\\xa0experimental antibody cocktail\\xa0developed by the company Regeneron early on in his care, a drug that is not widely available.\\nGwinnett County, the second largest county in Georgia by population with more than 900,000 residents, has seen exponential growth in the past decade with the population growing by more than 100,000 and diversifying among racial and ethnic groups. Since 2010, the number of African-American, Asian, and Hispanic residents in the county has grown by tens of thousands, a demographic shift that one University of Georgia political science professor described as a \"racial change\" that is evident in the fact that you can drive through Gwinnett and \"see signs in all languages.\" Cathy Cox was the first woman to serve as Georgia\\'s Secretary of State when she took office in 1999. Cox told\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\\xa0that if a Democrat wants to win the state of Georgia -- which hasn\\'t happened in a presidential election since Bill Clinton won in 1992 -- they must do well in Gwinnett County. \"It has been a perennial Republican county until the last 10 or 15 years when the demographics have shifted radically as immigrant communities have moved into the county, grown businesses, and now the population is trending very heavily Democratic,\" said Cox. \"That shift has caught a lot of people by surprise and it now has become truly a solid Democratic voting base, when Republicans used to not have to bat an eye to count on that as part of their tally.\" In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the suburban county outside of Atlanta by just 5%, but it was the first time in more than 20 years that a Democrat had won Gwinnett County in a presidential election -- a sign that Cox said shows the area has become more of a Democratic safety net. \"Democrats have always been able to count on Fulton County, DeKalb County, Richmond County in Augusta, Chatham County in Savannah, but now Gwinnett County is absolutely being added to that column.\"\\nCBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry\\xa0was first to report that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) War Room will be trolling the vice president in the hours leading up to the event with mobile billboards attacking him on his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic as attention focuses on Salt Lake City, Utah, where Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris will debate Wednesday night. \"As chair of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Pence owns the administration\\'s failed response to the pandemic more than anyone except Trump himself.\" Lily Adams, DNC War Room senior spokesperson and adviser, said in a statement to CBS News. \"As cases continue to rise across the country and millions of families struggle to make ends meet, Americans are owed answers tonight on the administration\\'s failed coronavirus response.\" To date, over 7 million Americans have contracted the virus and more than 210,000 Americans have died - statistics that will certainly be highlighted on the billboards, which will also feature audio of Mr. Trump naming Pence head of the task force during the onset of the pandemic. Another billboard highlights the Trump administration\\'s efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act and the protections afforded to people with preexisting conditions. A case on the nation\\'s health care law will be heard by the Supreme Court in the same week as the election in November.\\xa0For more on this click\\xa0here.\\nWith less than a month to go before November 3, Facebook announced additional measures it will take surrounding the 2020 election in what is expected to be an unprecedented election year. While the social network already had a plan in place to hit pause on new political and issue ads the week before the election,\\xa0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\\xa0reports it announced Thursday they will be removing all political, electoral and social issue ads when polls close on November 3, in an effort to reduce confusion and abuse. \"Advertisers can expect this to last for a week, though this is subject to change,\" said Sarah Schiff, product lead for political advertising at Facebook on a call with reporters. In a year where it could take time before multiple races are decided, Facebook is also working on labels and how they will be applied to election results. Once polls close, Facebook plans to run a notification at the top of Facebook and Instagram and apply labels to candidate posts that direct viewers to the network\\'s Voting Information Center on the vote counting process. Labels will include notifications that counting is still taking place and a winner has not yet been determined should a candidate or party declare victory in a race before it\\'s called by a major media outlet. Meanwhile, if a candidate or party contests a race already called by a major media outlet, Facebook will show the name of the declared winner and link to the Voting Information Center for more details in an effort to combat confusion. At the same time, Facebook said it will now remove calls for people to engage in poll watching when such calls use militarized language or suggest the goal is to \"intimidate, exert control, or display power over election officials or voters.\" This measure is in addition to steps already in place to remove calls for coordinated interference or bringing weapons to polling places. \"What we\\'re trying to do now is get to this more implicit speech,\" said vice president for content policy Monika Bickert, whose team will be making the enforcement decisions on the effort. Bickert noted that while this is a policy moving forward, Facebook will not be going back to retroactively remove old posts.\\nA new batch of polling shows Biden leading Mr. Trump in several key battleground states, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. According to new\\xa0Quinnipiac University\\xa0polls, Biden is leading Mr. Trump 51% to 40% in Florida, Biden is up 54% to 41% in Pennsylvania and Biden is leading Mr. Trump 50% to 45% in Iowa. In Florida, Biden was up 3 points in Quinnipiac polling in early September and in Pennsylvania, Biden was up 8 points in early September. It was the first Quinnipiac poll to survey likely voters in Iowa. The poll also showed Iowa Democratic Senate candidate Theresa Greenfield leading Republican incumbent Joni Ernst 50% to 45%. Separately, in Wisconsin, a new\\xa0Marquette University Law School\\xa0poll showed Biden leading Trump 46% to 41% among likely voters. The Marquette poll also found that 54% of Wisconsinites are planning to vote in-person on Election Day, up from 50% back in late August and early September. Biden still holds leads among voters planning to vote absentee, either by mail or in-person, and Trump leads among voters who plan to go to the polls on Election Day. The Marquette poll also found that 72% of respondents support a statewide mask order, which Democratic Governor Tony Evers recently extended, as the state faces a major COVID-19 outbreak. A conservative legal group challenged that order and Republicans in the state legislature filed a brief supporting that challenge, saying Evers didn\\'t have the power to do so.\\nIt\\'s been three years since Hurricane Maria ravaged the island of Puerto Rico, leaving thousands dead and others displaced, seeking shelter in cities like Orlando, Florida. Today, more than a million Puerto Ricans live in Florida, many of them in Kissimmee, where one of the key issues in the 2020 election will be Puerto Rico\\'s recovery efforts.\\xa0CBS News LaCrai\\xa0Mitchell\\xa0reports\\xa0that 27 days from the presidential election, Puerto Rican communities are organizing in Florida as both presidential candidates are actively appealing to this voting bloc. In September, just a few days after the Biden-Harris campaign announced a proposal to provide more infrastructure funding to help Puerto Rico rebuild, Mr. Trump announced nearly $13 billion would go to the island for recovery efforts three years after the storm hit. But many feel that this gesture is too little, too late. \"I\\'m voting for Biden. Is he perfect? No, he\\'s not. But I\\'m voting for Biden because we cannot stand another four years of what we got,\" said Frank Rivera, one of many volunteers who has helped Puerto Rican families settle in Central Florida. \"You cannot be humiliated, you cannot be put down by the administration and then turn around and give us $13 billion and think that that is enough to wipe everything clean.\"\\xa0Read the full story\\xa0here.\\nThe Franklin County Board of Elections announced Tuesday evening that some voters in the county received incorrect ballots via mail, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. In an updated statement on Wednesday, the board, who is working with the software vendor Bluecrest and the Ohio Secretary of State\\'s office to correct the issue, said they are still analyzing how many voters received incorrect ballots. \"The Board tested the system that was responsible for incorrect ballots,\" the board added in a statement. \"The system is now working as intended. Voters that received the wrong ballot will be issued a new correct replacement ballot. That ballot will be mailed out in the coming days.\"\\nIf the presidential race is close in Pennsylvania, it could take days, but not weeks, to know who won, the state\\'s top elections official said. \"Every time we\\'ve had a close race, it sometimes takes days until you know who the winner is,\" Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar said on a press call today. \"But I think the overwhelming majority of ballots cast in person and cast by mail will be able to be counted in a matter of days, not a matter of weeks.\" Boockvar and local elections officials have long been\\xa0asking\\xa0to be allowed to begin pre-canvassing mail ballots ahead of Election Day, but the governor and state legislature haven\\'t come to an agreement on legislation that would do so, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. The state Supreme Court last month also extended the deadline for mail ballots to arrive at elections offices to three days after the election, allowing for further delays. Official results aren\\'t due until 20 days after the election. Boockvar also said nearly 9 million Pennsylvanians have registered to vote in the state\\'s general election, a number her office believes to be a record. Democrats still vastly outnumber Republicans here, but by about 200,000\\xa0fewer\\xa0registered voters than in 2016. Boockvar also said over 60 of the state\\'s 67 counties have already begun mailing mail-in ballots or will in the coming days. Over 92,000 ballots have already been returned. About three dozen counties are using drop boxes for some mail ballots returns, but most have five or less, Boockvar said. About a half dozen have opened or plan to open satellite election offices where voters can register, apply for a mail ballot, fill it out and return it in a single trip.\\nThe Texas Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a challenge from Republican leaders in the state seeking to strike down an extended early voting period, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. In July, Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced there would be an extra 6 days of early voting in Texas and allowed people to hand deliver mail ballots before Election Day. Abbott had resisted calls to expand voting by mail access, but instead offered the extra 6 days of early voting. The Texas Supreme Court said Republicans challenged the decision too late and noted that the election is already happening. Early voting is set to begin in Texas on October 13. According to CBS News\\xa0data, 61% of likely voters in Texas plan to vote early in person.\\nThe combination of intense interest in the 2020 presidential election with a deadly pandemic is spurring sky-high rates of early voting. That\\'s going to have an impact on the way election night plays out this year, but it won\\'t affect the outcome\\xa0reports\\xa0CBS News Election & Survey Unit\\'s Kabir Khanna. So far,\\xa0over 5 million voters have already cast their ballots, and many more intend to do so in the coming weeks. Some will vote by mail, while others will do so in person at early voting centers. (Check out ways of voting in your state\\xa0here.) We\\'ve been asking voters in battleground states how they would prefer to vote this year. In six competitive states that CBS has polled over the past 3 weeks, each state, a sizable segment of likely voters tell us they would prefer to vote by mail or in person -- before Election Day, which falls on November 3. In states with strong track records of early voting -- like Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Texas -- large majorities prefer to vote by mail or early in person, ranging from 68% to 80%. Even in Pennsylvania, where early voting has been much less common, 36% want to vote by mail, with a narrower 57% majority saying they would like to vote in person on Election Day.\\nIn addition to the sheer magnitude of early voting this year, there\\'s an interesting pattern emerging: Democrats look much likelier to vote early, particularly by mail, than Republicans do. This pattern appears in survey data and actual ballot returns. In North Carolina, for instance, registered Democrats are returning mail ballots at substantially higher rates than registered Republicans are. In fact, most of the ballots returned in the state so far are from Democrats. By contrast, Republican voters are much likelier to express a preference for voting in person on Election Day. This difference is partly attributable to cues from party leaders, like Mr. Trump\\'s baseless\\xa0claims\\xa0that mail voting is fraudulent. Despite the president\\'s rhetoric, around nine in 10 Republicans who usually vote by mail want to do so again (much as Mr. Trump does himself). While most Trump voters prefer to vote as they usually do, many Biden voters want to change how they vote this year.\\nIn fact, it\\'s Democrats who are driving the partisan gaps in vote method by switching from Election Day to early voting. Many Biden voters say they usually vote in person on Election Day but fewer want to do so this year. The differences here are substantially larger than they are among Trump voters. In Pennsylvania, for example, just 35% say they prefer to vote on Election Day this year, compared to 82% who say they usually vote that way. In four of the five other states, the percentage for \"this year\" is less than half the \"usually\" percentage. What this all means for election night is that is that we\\'re likely to see substantial differences in the early and Election-Day vote. Partisan splits may be even larger in states where early voting is historically less common, like Ohio and Pennsylvania. In states that process early ballots before election night and therefore report their results more quickly on election night -- like Florida and North Carolina -- Biden may appear to do better in the early returns. In states like Pennsylvania -- where many counties will not even report mail votes on election night -- Trump may appear to be ahead as counties begin releasing results.\\nFortunately, we\\'ll be tracking all of this data at the\\xa0CBS News Decision Desk. Rather than rely solely on the tabulated votes at any given point in the night, our models estimate where the race will end up when all the votes are in. We\\'ll be estimating the total number of early ballots and outstanding ballots in each state, and our exit polls will include interviews at early vote centers, as well as phone interviews with voters who cast mail ballots. But we will not project a winner in a state until we\\'re confident the trailing candidate won\\'t catch up even after all ballots -- whether cast in person or by mail, early or on Election Day -- are counted.\\nNORTH CAROLINA\\nThe Army Reserve confirmed to CBS News Wednesday that it is investigating the matters involving Lieutenant Colonel James \"Cal\" Cunningham, reports\\xa0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. On Friday, Cunningham\\'s campaign confirmed the authenticity of flirtatious text messages between Cunningham and a political strategist, and since then, the AP has uncovered more text messages that show the relationship was recent and included intimate encounters. In his first interview since news of the text broke last Friday, Cunningham told CBS affiliate WNCN that he has hurt his family and disappointed his supporters, but the Senate race is about issues affecting North Carolinians, not his personal life, and wouldn\\'t answer questions about his relationship. He said he will cooperate with the Army Reserve investigation and answer any questions they might have. On the other side, incumbent Republican Senator Thom Tillis, who received a positive COVID-19 test on Friday, told WRAL he \"made a mistake taking off mask inside the White House.\" Tillis attended the nomination ceremony of Judge Amy Coney Barrett on September 26, and while he wore a mask outside, he took it off at the indoor reception.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Debate preparation is in full swing for President Trump and Joe Biden ahead of their first debate matchup on Tuesday evening. Mr. Trump has dispensed with traditional formal rehearsals and scripted practices and now is using flash cards and videos to review, sources tell\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\\xa0and\\xa0White House producer Fin Gomez. While some are concerned about the president\\'s lack of preparation, his advisers stress that he\\'s an \"atypical candidate,\" and they say his near-daily press availabilities and often \"hostile\" interactions with reporters are readying him. For Biden, debate prep has been taking place both in-person at his Delaware home and virtually, in huddles with long-time advisers and top campaign officials, according to a campaign source familiar with the strategy.\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\\xa0reports the Democrats are reviewing the president\\'s almost daily tweets about Biden, his record and his family as examples of the type of attacks they think the president will focus on. Top advisers are also trying to caution the former vice president from venturing \"in the weeds\" of complex policy as he was inclined to do on the campaign trail and in previous primary debates, the campaign source added. For more on what the candidates are expecting of one another,\\xa0read this story\\xa0from Sganga, Erickson and Gomez.\\nA New York Times\\xa0report\\xa0that Mr. Trump paid just $750 in federal income tax the year he entered the White House -- and, thanks to colossal losses, no income tax at all in 11 of the 18 years that the Times reviewed -- is raising doubts about Mr. Trump\\'s self-image as a shrewd and successful businessman, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. That Sunday\\'s report came just weeks before Election Day served to intensify the spotlight on Mr. Trump the businessman -- an identity that he has spent decades cultivating and that helped him capture the presidency four years ago in his first run for political office. The Times\\' report deepens the uncertainty surrounding a tumultuous presidential campaign set against the backdrop of a viral pandemic, racial unrest in American cities and a ferocious battle over the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \"It\\'s fake news. It\\'s totally fake news. Made-up, fake. We went through the same stories, you could\\'ve asked me the same questions four years ago,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday. He claimed that he could not release his tax returns due to an ongoing audit, although an audit does not stop him from releasing them publicly. \"I mean the stories that I read are so fake. They\\'re so phony,\" he added. The Trump Organization\\'s lawyer, Alan Garten, told CBS News in a statement \"The New York Times\\' story is riddled with gross inaccuracies. Over the past decade the President has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government.\" Trump campaign aides and allies have come to the defense of President Trump - with some advising the president to \"lean into\" discussions of his tax returns during the debate. \"Donald Trump has signed the front of paychecks. For the last 40 years, he\\'s created tens of thousands of jobs through his businesses. Joe Biden has never created one job. And I am certain that Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg and everybody else who has the financial resources attempts to pay the least amount of taxes as possible,\" former Trump campaign manager and 2020 campaign senior advisor Corey Lewandowski told CBS News. Asked if The New York Times\\' revelations undermine Mr. Trump\\'s credibility as a successful businessman, a former 2016 Trump campaign senior official told CBS News that financial reporting often \"gets lost\" on voters, particularly among the president\\'s most ardent supporters. \"It\\'s not as clear a shot as the media has always thought it would be.\"\\nFormer Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale was taken into police custody Sunday afternoon outside his Florida home after threatening to harm himself, according to the Ft. Lauderdale Police Department. Police body camera video showed responders tackling Parscale to the ground. Police seized 10 guns from his home. Parscale\\'s wife, Candice, told the responding officer she and her husband, now a senior advisor to the campaign, had had a physical altercation days earlier. Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told CBS News in a statement, \"Brad Parscale is a member of our family and we all love him. We are ready to support him and his family in any way possible.\" Parscale was transported to Broward Health Medical Center under the Baker Act, according to the FLPD. The Baker Act allows authorities to detain someone for mental health evaluation.\\nWhile Biden remained off the campaign trail on Monday, Senator Kamala Harris today made remarks at Shaw University, a HBCU in Raleigh, North Carolina, and kept the focus on the legacy of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Harris outlined what she believed is at stake with the president\\'s proposed replacement,\\xa0Judge Amy Coney Barrett. The Democratic vice presidential nominee kept the main criticism on Mr. Trump, but said Barrett has already made clear her positions against the Affordable Care Act and abortion. Harris addressed how a Republican lawsuit against the ACA will be heard by the Supreme Court after the election and said the ongoing effort to repeal it is \"driven by blind range towards Obama.\" Harris added, \"Judge Barrett has a long record of opposing abortion and reproductive rights. There is no other issue that so disrespects and dishonors the work of Justice Ginsburg\\'s life, than undoing the seminal decision in the court\\'s history that made it clear a woman has the right to make decisions over her own body.\"\\xa0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\\xa0reports Harris also called the attempt by Mr. Trump to nominate and confirm Barrett before election day \"raw power.\" Harris said, \"We\\'re not even debating whether the Senate should hold hearings on a nominee in an election year. We\\'re not in the middle of an election year. We\\'re in the middle of an election. An ongoing election.\"\\nA new survey released Monday is the latest to show Biden leading by some 5 points over Mr. Trump in Nevada, a key battleground state Hillary Clinton won by more than 2 points in 2016. But crosstabs from the\\xa0poll by BUSR and the University of Nevada Las Vegas\\xa0has the two candidates separated by less than 1 point in Washoe County, the state\\'s second-most populous, where Clinton had won by little more than 1 point. Political observers have often cited a number of years-long trends driving the once reliably-red county\\'s leftward swing, including a growing influx of residents from neighboring Northern California, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Democrats have shrunk the GOP\\'s voter registration advantage in Washoe County from several thousand in 2016 to just 630 voters, as of August. An analysis by the Reno Gazette Journal of then-Senator Dean Heller\\'s rout\\xa0in 2018\\xa0showed the Republican was defeated by \"massive Democratic turnout in urban areas and the loss of 25 swing districts that voted for Trump in 2016.\" Clark County, which spans Las Vegas in Southern Nevada and makes up nearly three-fourths of the state\\'s population, remains the grand prize for candidates looking to score a win in Nevada. But Democrats say their operation has devoted \"dozens of organizers\" to the once reliably-red Washoe County in Northern Nevada. Shelby Wiltz - Democrats\\' coordinated campaign director in Nevada - touted to reporters on a recent press call that Biden\\'s campaign and the state party have recruited \"hundreds of volunteers\" in the Reno area. Meanwhile, the GOP has repeatedly signaled Washoe County remains a key frontline for the Trump campaign, from the president\\xa0recently attempting to hold a Reno rally\\xa0in defiance of the state\\'s coronavirus caps on large gatherings to dispatching Donald Trump Jr. to host an event there\\xa0on Wednesday.\\nThe 2020 presidential election will pit two drastically different visions on immigration against each other, with the victor retaining or assuming broad executive authorities that have dominated policy-making on the issue for decades in the absence of congressional action. Mr. Trump\\'s reelection would allow his administration to continue cracking down on unauthorized immigrants, limiting legal immigration and curtailing humanitarian protections for foreigners. During a second term, Mr. Trump could also see through major policy changes to the U.S. immigration system that have so far been stalled by federal courts. If victorious, Biden will inherit an immigration system transformed by hundreds of changes made by the Trump administration, including a series of restrictive asylum policies, sweeping green card rules, broader deportation priorities, a decimated refugee program and pandemic-era border restrictions.\\nCurrent and former senior Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials and people close to the Biden campaign said the process of unwinding the Trump administration\\'s immigration policies could be an arduous and long effort. \"There has been such a demolition of our traditional immigration system under this administration, that the biggest challenge will be deciding where to begin rebuilding first,\" León Rodríguez, who led U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) during President Obama\\'s second term, told\\xa0CBS News digital immigration reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez. Cristóbal Alex, a senior Biden adviser, said the former vice president would take \"immediate actions to undo Trump\\'s horrific immigration policies,\" but conceded some \"will take longer than others.\" Rescinding Mr. Trump\\'s presidential edicts, such as his travel ban on a group of mostly African and Asian countries, will be easier than scrapping the \"public charge\" wealth test on green cards and visas instituted through federal regulations, officials said. Other changes will require appointing an attorney general committed to overturning precedent-setting decisions, such as one issued by Jeff Sessions in 2018 to restrict asylum for victims of gang and domestic violence. \"Stated policies are fairly easy to reverse, from a practical perspective,\" Rodríguez said. \"Regulations present a bit more complicated case. Most of the regulations that would be of concern to a Biden administration are the subject of legal challenges. And so, the status of those legal challenges will play a big role in what strategy a Biden administration would choose.\" Ken Cuccinelli, the second in command at DHS, said he expects the Trump administration\\'s legacy on immigration to endure -- even if the president loses reelection. Changing regulations, he added, is \"very slow.\" Cuccinelli told CBS News, \"It\\'s not like someone shows up on day one and can stop doing regulation A, B or C.\" He added, \"Anyone looking to undo all that is going to have a lot of work to do.\"\\nBiden will be under pressure from progressives to quickly reverse Mr. Trump\\'s changes, while also separating himself from some Obama administration practices unpopular with the immigrants\\' rights community. Returning to Obama-era policies, especially when it comes to deportations and the detention of migrant families, will not be sufficient, progressive activists warn. \"Biden needs to undo the harm, make advancements to decrease the level of enforcement and create other opportunities for people to get status,\" said Javier Valdés, the co-executive director of Make the Road New York and a member of a task force of Biden and Bernie Sanders supporters who created a unified immigration platform. \"When I say undo the harm created by the U.S. government towards immigrant communities, I\\'m not just saying what happened under Trump. Yes, it was on steroids, but this has been a historical issue.\"\\nRead more about the critical juncture for U.S. immigration policy this November\\xa0here.\\nMore Than A Vote released the first miniseries documentary video aimed at educating citizens about voting rights and voter registration. The first video featured former NFL quarterback Michael Vick and his voting rights restoration process in Florida, according to\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Vick was convicted in 2007 for his involvement in a dogfighting operation. A More Than A Vote spokesperson said there are plans for several similar videos over the next month. The spokesperson added that the goal of this video is to educate returning citizens about voting rights and voter registration in Florida ahead of the state\\'s voter registration deadline on October 5. \"You know it\\'s not an easy process to you know have voting rights restored or retained,\" Vick said in the video. In 2018, Florida voters approved a measure to restore the voting rights to citizens with a felony conviction who completed their sentence as long as those convictions were not murder or sexual assault. But in 2019, the Florida legislature passed legislation that required returning citizens with felony convictions to \"complete all the terms\" of their conviction, which included paying all fees associated with their case in order to get their voting rights restored. In May 2020, a federal judge called the 2019 law a \"pay to vote system\" and deemed the law unconstitutional. Almost a couple months later, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of letting of temporary halt on the order stand. Earlier this month, an appeals court decided that the 2019 law requiring formerly incarcerated people with prior felony convictions to pay their court fees and fines before their voting rights are restored is constitutional. \"Being blessed and having an opportunity to live a different life, it wasn\\'t a big concern for me as far as the finances and being able to pay fines,\" Vick said in the video. \"And some of these fines are like just thousands and thousands of dollars and you know, money that people don\\'t have or can\\'t generate. It\\'s unfortunate that if you don\\'t have it, then you don\\'t get it. You know, you don\\'t get a chance to be a part of chance.\" The video, titled \"Vick Votes: A More Than A Vote VLOG,\" also featured Desmond Meade, the executive director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, an organization that helps returning citizens pay their court fines and fees.\\nIn a decision late Friday, a federal court turned down an attempt by a handful of Navajo Nation residents to carve out an exception in Arizona\\'s mail ballot deadline. \"This lawsuit is about whether a deadline for receiving ballots is unlawful. Many of the issues Navajo voters face in accessing the postal service are not a result of the Receipt Deadline and will not be remedied no matter when the deadline to receive ballots is,\" Chief U.S. District Judge G. Murray Snow wrote\\xa0in his ruling\\xa0denying their motion for a preliminary injunction that would have forced county election officials to count ballots cast by Navajo Nation residents postmarked by Election Day but received in the days after, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. A coalition of Republicans, including the Trump campaign, had unsuccessfully moved to intervene as defendants in the case. The court has yet to dismiss the case, with a status conference now set for early October.\\nLawyers for the top Republicans in the Pennsylvania Senate on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop an order from the state\\'s highest court to count mail ballots received three days after the election so long as they aren\\'t postmarked after it.\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\\xa0reports\\xa0the Supreme Court\\'s response could decide whether a significant number of ballots are either counted or not in a key battleground state that was decided in 2016 by razor-thin margins. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court laid out its decision on late ballots and several other election issues in mid-September. State Senate Republicans on Monday asked the country\\'s highest court to halt only the state court\\'s order on counting late ballots with a nearly 300-page application to stay the order. They argued that the state court\\'s ruling was a violation of federal law that mandates holding elections on a single day and a violation of the Elections Clause because it was a decision from a court, not the state legislature.\\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on Tuesday in a case that could remove more than 100,000 people from the state\\'s voter rolls.\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\\xa0reports a state court first ruled in favor of removing the voters, but the state Court of Appeals ruled in February that people should not be removed. The case stems from a letter sent by the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) in October 2019 to about 230,000 voters indicating officials believed those people had moved from their current address. Since the letter was sent more than 60,000 people verified their address or registered at a new address. More than 40,000 were deemed to be ineligible to vote for another reason. As of June, the WEC estimated about 130,000 people could be removed from the rolls. It\\'s not clear if the court will rule before the November election. The Wisconsin Supreme Court will also hear arguments on Tuesday in a case about when a voter is considered indefinitely confined. Voters who meet that criteria do not have to provide a photo ID when requesting an absentee ballot.\\nDEBATES\\nWhile all eyes will be on Cleveland for Tuesday\\'s presidential debate, several House races in battleground states like\\xa0Minnesota,\\xa0Michigan\\xa0and\\xa0Pennsylvania, have had their own debates in recent days. For many of them, it was a race to the middle, reports\\xa0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. Democratic Congressman Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania\\'s 17th district began his\\xa0opening statement\\xa0touting the bipartisan bills he\\'s worked on. His opponent, Republican Sean Parnell, said he will \"always stand with the people of Western Pennsylvania and not that of a political party.\" Republican opponents overall looked to portray Democrat incumbents as not staying true to their 2018 promises of being moderate politicians, pointing to their impeachment votes or their ties to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\\nThe topic of healthcare and pre-existing conditions also gave candidates an opportunity to draw contrasts with their opponent. Most Democrats pointed to the Trump administration\\'s ongoing lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act during a pandemic, and pressed Republicans over whether they support protecting those with pre-existing conditions. Republican incumbent Fred Upton of Michigan\\'s 6th district said in his\\xa0Monday\\xa0debate he supports protecting pre-existing conditions, but if the lawsuit deems the ACA unconstitutional, Congress would need to come together and pass elements that has those protections. \"The story that is being told now is not reflective of the reality that we\\'ve seen,\" said Upton\\'s Democrat opponent Jon Hoadley, pointing to Upton\\'s votes to repeal the ACA. One notable moment came during\\xa0Michigan\\'s 8th district debate, when freshman Democrat Elissa Slotkin criticized her GOP opponent, Paul Junge, for not having a clear plan to protect those with pre-existing conditions, and for bringing up her\\xa0late mother\\'s case\\xa0with healthcare bills and premiums. \"Please don\\'t speak about my mother as if you understand what made her healthcare unaffordable to her,\" she said. \"I think it\\'s crazy that every time we ask you about specific details about the thing that really helps people know that they\\'re going to be protected...you deflect, and start attacking me, and raising my mother? Come on Paul.\" Slotkin\\'s campaign said the moment led to a record amount of single online donations on Sunday with 1,004 people donating.\\nRepublican candidates often looked to draw contrasts with their opponents on the issue of looting and civil unrest, saying they haven\\'t done enough to support law enforcement. \"In 2018, you gratefully accepted the endorsement of FOP 1, and you said that you always would defend the police. And now, just two short years later, you\\'re out marching with \\'Defund the Police\\' radicals...I find that reprehensible,\" Parnell said. In response, Lamb pointed to his work as a federal prosecutor and votes for police funding, and said, \"I\\'ve denounced violence across the board, that\\'s my actual record. So you can say what you want, you can call the names you want, make all the statements you want, my votes are my votes.\"\\nAnd in New Mexico, Democratic Congresswoman Xochitl Torres Small\\xa0squared off Sunday\\xa0in a debate with Republican Yvette Herrell, the first such rematch between the two this year for one of the nation\\'s most competitive House races, according to\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Among the issues the two candidates found common ground on: both voiced their strong backing for New Mexico\\'s sweeping oil and gas industry,\\xa0which claims\\xa0to drive more than $11 million into the state\\'s economy and has\\xa0repeatedly denounced Joe Biden\\xa0over his push to end new drilling on federal land. Asked whether she planned to vote for the former vice president, Torres Small conceded she would back Biden in spite of \"his oil and gas approach.\" The Democrat said Sunday, \"I stood up to my party to say that we should not ban fracking. I stood up to my party to make sure that we are investing in responsible solutions when it comes to climate change. And I stood up to my party when they tried to exclude oil and gas from coronavirus relief.\"\\n269-269\\nPelosi has been looking at the contingency plans if an electoral college tie happens and sent a letter to Democrat colleagues urging them to support the House Majority PAC.\\xa0Navarro\\xa0reports that in the case there is a 269-269 tie in the electoral college, which hasn\\'t happened since 1824, the U.S. House would vote for president as state delegations. Republicans currently control 26 delegations, meaning there are more Republican U.S. House members in a state than Democrats. Pennsylvania is tied at nine each and Democrats hold 23 delegations. Pennsylvania\\'s 10th district could be a tipping point for Democrats to tip that state in their favor, though they\\'d have to retain their other vulnerable representatives in the 7th, 8th and 17th districts. An internal poll of the 10th district, by the House Majority PAC, showed Democrat Eugene DePasquale up 7 points on incumbent Republican Scott Perry. House Democrats are also propping up their candidates in Alaska and Montana, which only hold one Congressional district a piece. In her letter, Pelosi said, \"Because we cannot leave anything to chance, House Majority PAC is doing everything it can to win more delegations for Democrats. It\\'s sad we have to have to plan this way, but it\\'s what we must do to ensure the election is not stolen.\"\\n'},\n",

Brennan, who led the agency during the Obama administration from 2013 to 2017, offers new insights into the intelligence community\\'s assessments of Russia\\'s interference in the 2016 election, shares concerns about the potential politicization of the community\\'s work, and discusses the merits of pursuing a career in national security. Brennan, now retired, also discusses details included in his new memoir,\\xa0UNDAUNTED: My Fight Against America\\'s Enemies, at Home and Abroad.\\nHIGHLIGHTS:\\xa0\\xa0\\nDownload, rate and subscribe here:\\xa0iTunes,\\xa0Spotify\\xa0and\\xa0Stitcher.\\nINTELLIGENCE MATTERS – JOHN BRENNAN\\nProducer: Ariana Freeman\\nMICHAEL MORELL: John, welcome to the show. It is an honor to have you with us.\\nJOHN BRENNAN: \\xa0Michael, it\\'s great to be invited to your show. And I just want to say thank you for doing Intelligence Matters over the past several years, because I think it\\'s critically important that more Americans really understand the importance of the intelligence profession and just how vital our national interests are in this day and age. So thank you again for what you do.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: You\\'re welcome. John, first off, congratulations on your book, Undaunted: My fight against America\\'s Enemies at Home and Abroad. I\\'ve read it. It\\'s extraordinarily well done. Lots of great stories, but more importantly, lots of important lessons. So I encourage all of my listeners to get themselves a copy and to read it closely. I also just want to highlight for all my listeners that you and I are friends. So full transparency is important in everything, including journalism. So I just want everybody to know that.\\nJOHN BRENNAN: And former colleagues for over 30 years.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: Absolutely. So, John, my original plan was to spend our entire time on the book, in particular aspects of it that may not get as much attention in your other interviews, but the news cycle demands that I ask you about three issues that have played out in the media in the last few days, and then we\\'ll dig into the book.\\nSo the first, which you actually talk about in your book, has to do with the intelligence community\\'s judgment in late 2016 about Russia\\'s interference in the election. And what\\'s played out in the media is that the analysts had done their work, they made an analytical call and you get a visit by two of your senior officers. Can you walk us through what happens there? And I actually think this is important because I actually worry that John Durham, the Justice Department official who\\'s investigating the origins of the Mueller investigation, may actually get this wrong in his report. So I really want to take some time to go through that. So, what happened?\\nJOHN BRENNAN: Well, thanks, Mike. And as you know, the CIA is the intelligence community\\'s premiere, all-source analytic organization. And so the CIA was tapped to take the lead on drafting this intelligence community assessment, a very sensitive one on Russian interference in the 2016 election. It was the CIA, the FBI, the NSA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the ODNI, that was responsible for pulling that together. The CIA probably had a dozen or so analysts, many of them very senior, who were responsible for putting this draft together. And they worked with their counterparts at NSA and FBI and ODNI. And then when the draft was done, there were several key judgments. One among them was that the Russians were trying to advance the electoral prospects of Donald Trump. And initially when that draft was done, all of the four agencies deemed that that judgment had high confidence of the analysts in those four agencies. Ultimately, the NSA decided that they were going to lower their level of confidence to medium, which, as you know, is not that much of a distinction from high confidence. But it\\'s a distinction nevertheless. But there was certainly no argument about the solid nature of that judgment itself within CIA; CIA analysts, the authors of the assessment who were steeped in the intelligence, determined that they had high confidence in their judgment.\\xa0\\nNow, as you point out, there were two senior officials, U.S. CIA officials, who worked in that Russia Mission Center who weighed in with me to say that they believed that the confidence level of that one judgment shouldn\\'t be at the high level. That should be at the medium level. Well, one of them sent an email to me and asked if they could talk with me. And so I invited them to my office and sat down with both of them. And for about 30 minutes or so, we talked it through and they explained their reasoning. I explained to them that I was very much deferring to the judgment of the analysts who were responsible for authoring the assessment, but that I also shared the analysts\\' views because in judgment, I had read through all of the intelligence, including the raw intelligence, and I encouraged the two senior officers to talk to the analysts about that judgment. They said they already had. But the authors, the analysts were unconvinced by their argument. Well, I said that I encourage them to do it again if they feel strongly about it.\\xa0\\nBut what I wasn\\'t going to do was to overrule the considered and consensus judgment of those CIA analysts who were involved in this issue and had authored that assessment. And I know that there\\'s some press reports out there saying that I overruled those two senior officers; no, I didn\\'t. I decided that I was not going to overrule the analysts who wrote that. And so, you know, managers, have the opportunity and they should weigh in. But at the end of the day, as you and I have both been managers of the analytic process, it really comes down to what those analysts determine, what their findings are, what they base those judgments on, and so that judgment at the high confidence level prevailed, as far as the CIA position.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: So I think what a lot of people in the public might not get is that the analysts make the call, right. I think a lot of people would assume that, of course, the director should say what the analytic line is and they don\\'t understand the culture of the place and how it works. Right. And what is really important here is to understand that you were actually doing exactly what you were supposed to do and not stepping in and changing the analytic judgment, which would have been considered by the analysts a serious problem had you done that?\\xa0\\nJOHN BRENNAN: \\xa0Absolutely. I would have been roundly and rightly criticized for overturning that judgment just because two CIA officers came in and weighed in with me. So whether or not you\\'re talking about an individual agency product or an intelligence community assessment or a National Intelligence Estimate, the analytic views are subject to great debate, scrutiny and rigorous review. But at the end of the day, if a manager of one of those organizations decides to change the judgment, I think that is something that, again, is contrary to what the analytic process should be and needs to be.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: So John, the second issue I wanted to raise with you is the letter that the Director of National Intelligence sent last week to the Senate Judiciary Committee about Hillary Clinton and Russian interference in 2016. The intelligence the DNI declassified and released, for my listeners, simply said that Russian intelligence analysis said that Hillary Clinton approved a plan in July 2016 to tie Donald Trump to Putin and Russian interference in the election. What was your reaction to the DNI\\'s declassification of that information?\\nJOHN BRENNAN: I thought it was a outrageous, appalling and blatant act of politicization that he released, very selectively, some intelligence that was provided then to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is right now engaged in, I think, a very partisan effort to try to debunk the necessary investigative efforts of the FBI that looked into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\\xa0\\nAnd I think it also just reflects that Donald Trump, after being frustrated with the first two Directors of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, who served in that position from the beginning of the administration, then Joseph McGuire, who was serving in an acting capacity. I think they refused to bend to Donald Trump\\'s whims. But clearly, Richard Grenell, who served in an acting capacity before John Ratcliffe became the Director of National Intelligence. I think they have abused their authority and the position of the director of national intelligence in order to promote the very personal and partisan and craven objectives of Donald Trump. So I was quite appalled by that.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: John, can you talk about how that information was handled when it was received in 2016?\\nJOHN BRENNAN: Yeah, well, the memo that Ratcliffe released said that my handwritten notes showed that I had briefed President Obama and national security officials, the seniors, about that intelligence. And I briefed it for a couple of reasons. One is that I wanted to give President Obama and others a sense of the extent of our access and our intelligence collection capabilities against the Russians, to demonstrate that we did have this insight into what the Russians were doing, what they were saying among themselves and so on. But I also wanted to demonstrate that I didn\\'t care whether or not they were Russians. We\\'re talking about a Republican or Democrat or one candidate or the other. I wanted to make sure that I was blind to that political issue.\\xa0\\nAnd again, I\\'m limited in terms of what I can say about this, because Ratcliffe only very narrowly released something. But let\\'s just say that what was within those quotes in the memo about Hillary Clinton approving this plan that was teed up by one of her advisers to highlight Donald Trump\\'s ties to Russia as a way to distract from her email and server issue – let\\'s say that was accurate, and I am not saying that at all. Far from it. But if it were, there is nothing illegal about that. And Ratcliffe\\'s memo implies that since it was sent to the FBI as part of a larger report, that it basically implies that Secretary Clinton was engaged in illegal activity by doing it. Again, I\\'m not saying that that\\'s what Secretary Clinton had approved, but even if she had, there is nothing illegal about that. And that would not have been the basis for CIA to refer that report to the FBI for follow-up investigation, for possible criminal activity.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: So I infer from that and I don\\'t know if you can answer this, but I infer from that that the reason it was passed to the FBI was because of something else that was in there?\\nJOHN BRENNAN: Yes and as you know, I have not been allowed access to classified information. I was able to review some things during the Durham investigation that they asked me about. This was part of a number of documents that I was asked about. And I don\\'t know exactly what Ratcliffe was referring to there in terms of which report. And I don\\'t recollect what else might have been in that report. But again, I can say definitively that at least what was quoted in the Ratcliffe memo was not a basis for any type of potential criminal referral.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: OK, and then the third issue, John, is the president contracting COVID. And a number of folks have said publicly that one of the reasons why the White House can\\'t be transparent about the president\\'s health is because of national security concerns. Can you just comment on that?\\nJOHN BRENNAN: Well, as we\\'re conducting this interview, I hear that Donald Trump is going to be released from Walter Reed in a few hours and listening to some of his medical doctors talking about his condition, they, I think, selectively release some things and don\\'t release others, pointing out to HIPAA requirements in terms of privacy rights of individuals and patients.\\xa0\\nI do not believe that based on what I have heard and my understanding of the responsibilities of the medical staff of the president, that there\\'s nothing in my mind that would negatively implicate national security by providing a more truthful accounting to the American people about Donald Trump\\'s condition. There are some things that I think, you know, might need to be kept quiet, and that\\'s when you could bring in members of Congress, the leadership of Congress or whoever else. But based on what I\\'m hearing right now, it doesn\\'t seem like there is any national security issue that\\'s being protected.\\nIt\\'s more Donald Trump, again, understandably, you know, knowing who he is, is trying to project a image of strength, power, resilience, and I think just secrecy as far as his personal affairs, whether they be business and financial or whether they be health records.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: OK, John, back to your book. Let me mention some people. Let me just throw out some names and ask you what kind of impact they had on your life, your approach to your career, your success, etc. So let me start with your parents.\\nJOHN BRENNAN: Well, Michael, I\\'ve heard you talk about your parents and you know how important they were to you in your life. I was very, very fortunate to have both a mother and a father who really instilled in me a sense of distinction between right and wrong, which gave me a moral compass that I think was grounded in their religious faith. I was raised in a very religious household, a Catholic household, but also just gave me a sense of the importance of honesty, integrity, but also giving back to this country.\\nI talk in the book about how my father is an immigrant to this country who came here when he was 28 years old and always told my brother, sister and myself that we need to give back to this great country of ours and not just take, take, take. So both of them were tremendous role models. And I miss them dearly and I think of them every day.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: \\xa0Your wife, Kathy.\\nJOHN BRENNAN: Kathy and I got married when we were very both very young. We were 22 years old. And so we just celebrated a couple months ago our 42nd anniversary. And we\\'ve been through thick and thin together, tough times together. And it\\'s very challenging, as you well know, for the family of CIA officers and national security officials to have somebody in the household that frequently is not there and even when they\\'re there, that I am somewhere else. And so I\\'ve had to rely on Kathy to continue to encourage me to do the things that I needed to do, but also tremendous understanding. And I never would have reached my ambitions and my goals had it not been for her love, support and understanding. I just I can\\'t find enough words to thank her for what she\\'s done.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: A CIA officer named Karl Ruhle?\\nJOHN BRENNAN: You know when I got to the agency in 1980, I first started off in operations and moved to analysis.\\xa0 And after a couple of years under my belt as an analyst, I really thought that I knew a little tradecraft – until I met someone like named Karl Ruhle, who was my supervisor. And he just explained to me the difference between giving one\\'s views and personal judgments and using information and intelligence and data to drive analysis.\\xa0\\nI remember one of the lessons he told me was that so many analysts use words like \\'probably\\' and \\'likely\\' and \\'almost certainly\\' as crutches because they cannot martial the information and the analytic arguments in the data to drive their analysis. So he was somebody who I just really revered after he would take the time to mentor me and to teach me and somebody who was a tremendous role model for me as I pursued my intelligence career.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: George Tenet.\\nJOHN BRENNAN: George was one of my PDB recipients and briefees when I was Bill Clinton\\'s daily PDB briefer, the President\\'s Daily Brief down at the White House. George was the director of intelligence programs at the national security staff at the time, and he was somebody who was just a ball of energy and knew so much about the intelligence profession, about CIA. He had served as the staff director of the Senate Intelligence Committee before he joined the White House staff. And when he was nominated to be the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence under John Deutch, he asked me to join him at the agency and give up my PDB briefing responsibility and become his executive assistant as his deputy. Well, George and I have ever since forged a very close relationship – again, friend, mentor, advisor, counsel and I served as his chief of staff when he was director, served as deputy executive director.\\nAnd George is somebody who, in terms of integrity, in terms of work ethic, in terms of dedication to this country\\'s security and to every man and woman who worked at CIA. He is an exceptionally talented but also an exceptionally thoughtful, generous person. And I\\'ve just been very fortunate to be associated with him during my career.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: And I think he\\'s had an amazing legacy. I mean, there are still senior officers at CIA who he mentored. All these years, you know, almost 16 years later, his legacy lives on.\\nJOHN BRENNAN: That\\'s a good way to describe it. It is a legacy. It\\'s not just in terms of what he did while he was there, but it\\'s those individuals that he really helped guide. And many of them are still there at the agency. And I think they\\'re sharing what they learned from George with younger officers today.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: And lastly, Barack Obama.\\nJOHN BRENNAN: Well, I was very fortunate to work for the entire eight years of the Obama presidency. And I didn\\'t know Barack Obama before he was elected president. I was a remote, long-distance, indirect advisor to his kitchen cabinet, to his campaign. And I relate the story in the book. When I first met him in Chicago the week after the election, and when he asked me first to be director of CIA and then asked me to to join him at the the White House, when that first offer didn\\'t work out. And for the first four-plus years, my office was right below his in the White House, in the West Wing. I got to know him very well. I got to meet with him several times a day.\\xa0\\nSomebody who was exceptionally, exceptionally talented, exceptionally conscientious about carrying out his responsibilities as president and was very, very interested in making decisions that were going to optimize our national interests. But also, given that we both have been involved in counterterrorism over the years, carrying out the counterterrorism programs in the most effective surgical manner, that optimizes the safety and security of Americans and innocent people everywhere, but also minimizes to the greatest extent, any unintended harm to anyone. And I greatly admired him for his emphasis on doing just that.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: John, I want to turn to a series of what may seem and actually are random questions, but I think our listeners will find your answers interesting. The first one is I want to ask you about ethics and intelligence. I often get a question from students: Isn\\'t there an inherent conflict between the two? And you\\'re one of the most ethical people that I know. How would you answer that question from the students?\\nJOHN BRENNAN: Well, I don\\'t know if I\\'m the most ethical people you know, Michael. I\\'ve tried to live by that North Star that my parents instilled in me. And, ethics I think need to be a part of anything anyone does in their life. It\\'s one thing to abide by the law. It\\'s another thing to engage in ethical and principled behavior.\\xa0 And clearly, the CIA over the last 70 plus years has been engaged in a lot of things that are very, very controversial and a number of things that I disagreed with, and that I had to really come to terms with sometimes during my time at CIA and sometimes before I joined the organization.\\nBut I do think particularly for a democracy and one that is founded on the principles, democratic principles that are embedded in our Constitution and that we are very fortunate to be able to have, I think that needs to be a good guide for what our intelligence and security services do. I do think it\\'s critically important that we gain insight into the threats and challenges that we face around the globe. But I think there\\'s a way to do it that will allow us to remain consistent to those values as Americans.\\nI talk about in the book that there are a number of times when I was at the CIA where there were advocates of engaging in propagating false information about our adversaries. And I just don\\'t believe the United States should be in the business of being a purveyor of misinformation, disinformation. I think there is a lot that we can accomplish, as much as we need to accomplish, we can do it with truthful information. And so whether or not you\\'re talking about recruiting human assets, whether or not you\\'re talking about different types of technical collection systems, I think it has to be looked through a dual prism of what is legal and what is duly authorized and then also what is ethical, principled and consistent with our values as Americans. And I recognize that that sometimes is a very, very tough combination to meet when there are national security imperatives and serious threats to our country. I think sometimes the CIA has gotten it right and sometimes we\\'ve gotten it wrong. So I think this is something that we have to learn from, every time that we\\'re faced with one of these challenges.\\xa0\\nMICHAEL MORELL: John, in the context of ethics, I\\'m going to ask you about something in the book: Enhanced Interrogation Techniques, what some people call torture. You\\'ve said before and you say in your book that you were uncomfortable with that program and that you spoke up at the time, but perhaps not as loudly as you should have.\\xa0\\nI want to ask you a different question about it, because I\\'ve actually thought a lot about this, and I think I know you pretty well. And I believe that if you had been the director at the time, I believe that you would not have approved the techniques. We don\\'t need to debate that. But that\\'s what I really believe.\\xa0\\nAnd my question is, what would you have done when the counterterrorism folks came to you and said that they wanted to do this and gave you a reason why they wanted to do it? What would you have told them? What would you have done? What would you have said to them?\\nJOHN BRENNAN: Well, I think it certainly was imperative that the CIA be aggressive in the aftermath of 9/11, working with our foreign counterparts, intelligence security services around the globe who were in the process of picking up a number of these known and suspected terrorists. And they needed to be detained, arrested, captured. But the CIA had no history, no experience in conducting an interrogation program as well as holding individuals captive.\\xa0\\nAnd I think at the time, I would have tried to ensure the great wealth of CIA intelligence and counterterrorism experience be brought to bear, but that other elements that have had that experience, such as the U.S. military, which does detain people and capture people and also does interrogate, and that the bureau, the FBI, that has been involved in interrogations, debriefings, solicitation for decades, they were the ones that had that experience. But to ask the CIA to carry out both a detention and interrogation program in the heat of the 9/11 aftermath and basically stand up a program without that background experience, I think was asking too much.\\xa0\\nYou know, the CIA culture is always to salute a order from the commander in chief. And that program was duly authorized by the President of the United States. It was deemed lawful by the highest legal advisory body in the executive branch, the Office of Legal Counsel and Department of Justice.\\nIt was briefed to the committees of jurisdiction. So I greatly sympathize with all those CIA officers who wanted to stop a recurrence of that horrific 9/11 attack. But that is the time where I think we should say, \\'OK, we can do this part of it, but we need others to carry out some of these other areas of responsibility.\\'\\nMICHAEL MORELL: Let\\'s go from ethics to national security as a career for young Americans. I spend a lot of time on college campuses and I think many students today have a view that is different from the view that you and I had growing up, right.\\xa0\\nWe believed that America, yes, made some mistakes in the world, but that it was generally a force for good. And many of the students that I run into today don\\'t believe that; they believe that the U.S. has largely been a force for bad in the world and therefore they have real doubts about working for the government in general and for a national security agency like CIA in particular. What would you tell those students?\\nJOHN BRENNAN: \\xa0First of all, Michael, like you, I try to spend as much time as I can now in my retirement, encouraging young Americans at various university colleges to give back to this great country of ours and encourage them to disregard all of the craziness in Washington right now and pursue a career in national security, intelligence, law enforcement, diplomacy, military, because this country really, really needs it.\\xa0\\nAre we an imperfect union? Absolutely. That\\'s why the preamble of the Constitution says in order to form a more perfect union. Has the CIA made mistakes in the past? Absolutely it has. And unfortunately, some of them were very bad mistakes. But has the CIA and the intel community and the U.S. military and the state done things to keep this country strong and safe? Absolutely.\\xa0\\nAnd one of the reasons why I think it\\'s so important for young Americans to give back to this country is that this is a very unique country. I do believe strongly in American exceptionalism, not because we are any better or smarter or more clever than anybody else. We have benefited from having such a large country with tremendous natural resources, arable land, navigable rivers, long sea coasts. And we\\'re the melting pot of the world. And I think with that exceptional, great, good fortune, we have exceptional global responsibilities. And the world\\'s peace and security really rests a lot on the United States\\' role in that world.\\xa0\\nLook what we did during World War II as far as stopping Nazi expansionism, imperial Japan, we were responsible for rebuilding the international system and the aftermath of World War II with the Marshall Plan, the international financial system. We have been the leader of the call for for human rights and justice and liberal democratic order. If we shirk those responsibilities, we really are putting ourselves at risk. And so, therefore, the CIA, if it carries out its responsibilities ethically and in a principled fashion, plays an integral role in ensuring that the United States is going to live up to, I think, not only its potential, but also its responsibilities.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: John, let me tell you a couple of things that I worry about and get your reaction to them. One is, I think, thanks to their rhetoric and to the actions of President Trump and those who have enabled him, is that a significant percentage of Americans now see the intelligence community, to include the CIA, as the \"Deep State.\" Right. And that is not just going to go away with an election of a President Biden. Those people are going to continue to believe that. So how would you advise the leadership of the IC going forward to deal with that issue that a good chunk of the country sees them in a dangerous way?\\nJOHN BRENNAN: Well, Michael, you and I would administer the oath of office to new agency employees in front of Memorial Wall. And it was one of the great privileges of our roles. And I can recall telling those new employees to disregard all of the political rhetoric and the partisan sniping that goes on in Washington, that the CIA and the intelligence community frequently is that football and the meat in the partisan sandwich. And I am concerned that what we\\'ve heard and seen in the last three and a half plus years really has been demoralizing because a lot of people are concerned that here we have somebody in the Oval Office who is dismissive of intelligence and denigrates the role and sacrifices of the members of the intel community, law enforcement and others.\\nI think it\\'s really incumbent on the future leaders of the intel community to speak out. Both you and I, I think, took opportunities to give public addresses when we were in office and to better explain to the American people. And yes, sometimes we\\'re criticized for some of the things that we do or say, but I think greater transparency is the best way to undercut a lot of these allegations of \"deep statehood\" in the in the national security environment.\\xa0\\nAnd so I do think that if Joe Biden is elected, I think there\\'s going to be certainly a new chapter. There\\'s going to be much greater respect paid to these dedicated Americans by the White House and by the national security seniors. But I do think the intelligence community officials, but also members of Congress, it is so, so unfortunate that intelligence, the intelligence work is now the subject of great partisan sniping on the Hill. Years ago, when we both would go down and brief the intelligence committees of jurisdiction, I felt that the members would would hang their political coat and party coat at the door and they would really sit down and enjoy the discussion with us on national security matters and do it in a very bipartisan fashion. I think we need to return to those days. And I think it\\'s incumbent on the senior officials in the executive branch and senior members of Congress to do exactly that.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: John, the other thing I\\'m worried about is, is that nativism has taken over our politics. And patriotism, right, is required to serve one\\'s country, and I just wonder if those two things, nativism and patriotism, are at the end of the day inconsistent with each other?\\nJOHN BRENNAN: They very much are. Patriotism, to me, connotes a sense of real pride and devotion and commitment to your country, to your state and to what it stands for and what it is. Nativism is more looking at things in a very sort of myopic way and almost an us-versus-them. I know that nativism has taken root in so many countries, not just in the United States, because people are reacting to sometimes foreign influences and people are concerned about encroachment on their culture or their language, on their jobs and other things. And that\\'s why I think Donald Trump\\'s mantra of \"America First, America First\" is really shrill on the ears of a lot of people around the world because they believe that the United States is going to pursue this nativist policy, that we\\'re going to leverage our muscularity in economics, finance, you know, political and military spheres to better us and to disadvantage others.\\xa0\\nWhile patriotism, I think, recognizes that you have a responsibility to your country, to your fellow citizens, but it doesn\\'t come at the exclusion of trying to ensure that the world as a whole becomes a better place because of the efforts of your country. So I very much am concerned about the growth of nativism here in this country, particularly, as you know, xenophobia has really taken hold in so many places. But I think this is all part of the globalization that we\\'re becoming much more interconnected. And unfortunately, a lot of people feel threatened by these changes. And I do think that our politicians and government officials have to be more honest with their people, with our citizenry, as opposed to fueling the animus that unfortunately is in evidence in so many places.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: I guess this takes us to maybe the most important question, which is the health and even the sustainability of our democracy. Obviously, it\\'s an important question for everybody, but I do think that career intelligence officers have a special perspective because they\\'ve watched so many countries over the years, you know, struggle with democracy in some countries, even lose it. So how worried are you, John, about our democracy?\\nJOHN BRENNAN: I am worried about it. And democracy is a process. It\\'s not a static state in my mind. Michael, you and I were working –\\xa0 I was at the White House. You were at CIA during the Arab Spring. And I remember that there were a lot of folks who thought that if you just got rid of those authoritarian rulers that, democracy is going to flourish in the Arab world. Well, democracy is not like a light switch. You just can\\'t flip it on and off.\\nAnd although we are the oldest democracy and I think in many respects the strongest democracy, it is still fragile because our laws and our Constitution have given us a guide for how we can ensure that democracy is going to flourish here. But it really comes down to whether or not individuals in positions of authority, from the president on down, are going to honor the spirit of those democratic principles, or are they going to try to circumvent those principles and undercut them?\\xa0\\nAnd so the impact of Donald Trump and unfortunately so many others who have turned a blind eye to his trampling of our democracy as well as enabled it. And I am just so disappointed in the many members of the Republican Party. I\\'m neither a Democrat or Republican and I worked for Republican administrations, had great respect for them. But to listen to a number of those Republican senators and members of the House of Representatives just willfully and purposely mislead the American public about what Donald Trump is doing is just – it\\'s very unfortunate.\\xa0\\nSo I am concerned that what we\\'ve seen over the past number of years is eroding some of those foundation stones of our democracy. And just like how I think we need to adapt to the realities of the 21st century as far as governance and governance is really much more difficult today than it was 50 years ago. Same thing with capitalism. I think what we need to do is to see how we can refine some of these democratic and capitalistic principles in order to ensure equal opportunity, equal justice for all. And unfortunately, there is too much inequality at this this time, both on the social and political front as well as on the economic front, that really does, I think, inhibit our further development in order to form that more perfect union.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: John, you\\'ve been terrific with your time. I just want to ask a couple more questions. You undertook something at the agency when you were a director called \\'modernization.\\' What was that? What were you trying to accomplish? And what impact do you think it\\'s had so far?\\nJOHN BRENNAN: Well, I recognize that the world has changed significantly since the agency was first stood up, you know, 75 years ago. And that\\'s the global ecosystem, the operating environment for the CIA. And we needed to adapt to the new realities of the 21st century. And I was always impressed as a young officer in how the US military was able to better integrate its capabilities as a result of the Goldwater Nichols Act, bringing together the services, the Army, the Navy, the Marines, the Air Force, and have unified chains of command and combatant commands overseas, like in Central Command or European Command and so on. And I believed that the agency could do that better.\\xa0\\nI had worked in the Counterterrorism Center, which was the first experiment in CIA back in the early 80s, mid-80s to bring together the different components of the agency to work in a more integrated fashion. So when I returned to the agency as director in 2013, I was determined to try to position the agency to deal with the challenges of the future and that evolving 21st century ecosystem. And although I\\'m a liberal arts guy, you know, I tend to be enamored with systems engineering and trying to figure out the best design for the interoperability of systems and people and capabilities and authorities and data.\\xa0\\nAnd so we basically overhauled the CIA structure so that you brought together all those different disciplines and skills and areas of responsibility and authority so that you can have a combined effort. When you are looking at Russia or China, are you looking at functional issues that you\\'re not going to just have a series of stovepipes in the agency, you\\'re going to have a much more matrixed and integrated model. And I think so far it has it has worked out; some tweaks to be made, which are inevitable.\\xa0\\nPeople used to ask me when I was at the agency, \\'When is this modernization process going to be over?\\' And I said, \\'No, it\\'s never going to be over. It\\'s a process of continuous improvement and adaptation to that changing environment that we work in.\\' And whether or not you\\'re a government agency or department or you\\'re a business or even academic institution, if you don\\'t take into account all the changes in that ecosystem of which you are a part, you are going to be left behind. And so you have to continuously change and adapt to those new realities, particularly in a in a technologically driven and technologically revolutionary world.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: So John, that\\'s one significant reform at CIA. Do you think the intelligence community more broadly needs major reforms?\\nJOHN BRENNAN: \\xa0Well, I think there needs to be a regular review. Now, the U.S. intelligence community, as you well know, is rather large, cumbersome, in some respects unwieldy. And I am personally glad that the position of the Director of National Intelligence was created as a result of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, because when I was, I served as George Tenet\\'s chief of staff, George had the CIA director hat on and the head of the intel community hat on. And those are very challenging and they\\'re both very full-time jobs.\\xa0\\nSo having Jim Clapper serve as the Director of National Intelligence when I was the director of CIA, it really allowed me to focus on all the different things that CIA has to do. Now, we are about 16 years from that seminal legislative reform effort in the IRTPA. And I do think it\\'s worthwhile to take a fresh look at what that legislation got right, what needs to be refined and tweaked. But I would very much counsel against going back to the old model that brings together those roles of Director of National Intelligence and Director of CIA. It\\'s just too much for one person to be able to do well in this day and age.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: Not to mention being the president\\'s intelligence advisor, right, which takes a tremendous amount of your time on top of both of those roles. So, John, the other thing I wanted to ask you about was you\\'re very vocal and visible support when you were director for the LGBTQ community at the agency. Talk a little bit about why diversity and inclusion was so important to you as director.\\nJOHN BRENNAN: Well, I think there are a couple of reasons. You know, a very fundamental one, I think one that is incontrovertible, is that I don\\'t believe any agency can make a better case for diversity than CIA. CIA is supposed to be this government\\'s, this country\\'s eyes and ears around the globe. And this is a pretty diverse globe. And if we\\'re not able to tap into the diversity that is in America so that we have better insight into the culture, the languages, the people, the politics abroad, well, bad on us. And so just from a business case perspective, we really needed to emphasize that.\\nSecondly, though, and probably even more fundamentally, is that America, in my mind, stands for something. It stands for an inclusivity that really recognizes that we have come to this country – except for the Native Americans – and everybody else can trace their roots to somewhere else around this globe. And I think a lot of our ancestors were subject to a lot of bias and discrimination. And I believe it\\'s really incumbent on the U.S. government to be the leading light on diversity and inclusion.\\xa0\\nAnd Michael, when you and I first joined the agency back in the early 1980s, individuals of the LGBTQ community could not even get a security clearance. They were ostracized and they had to live these very hidden and secretive lives. And I just felt that I knew some of the individuals who went through that very, very painful journey themselves in the agency. And it was time for the agency to ensure that we were very proactive in terms of ensuring that all races, all ethnicities, all religions, all sexual orientations, people with disabilities, everybody in the agency felt as though they had equal opportunity to join the agency and to flourish within the agency and thrive. And like you, I was a very strong advocate of the LGBT community. I wore my Rainbow lanyard.\\nAnd as I relate in the book, during my tenure, there were countless officers that would come up to me and just say, \\'Thank you so much for having a very sort of a physical support and noticeable support to that community.\\' It it makes a difference in their lives. And again, if you really believe in the American experiment and what America is, it is something that I think there\\'s no way that you cannot not support and endorse the diversity inclusion initiatives that thankfully have gained traction in this country. And that\\'s one of the things I was concerned about when Donald Trump was elected, because there were many CIA officers, women and others who came up to me worried that there was going to be a reversal of some of those practices and policies.\\nMICHAEL MORELL: The book is UNDAUNTED: My Fight Against America\\'s Enemies, at Home and Abroad. The author is John Brennan. John, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for spending your time with us.\\nJOHN BRENNAN: Thank you, Michael. I really enjoyed it.\\xa0\\n'},\n",

Rights campaigners alleged two weeks ago that a number of hysterectomies had been carried out at a privately run detention center in Georgia.\\nThe Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it sent a diplomatic note, asking the U.S. government \"to clarify the situation, requesting information on the medical attention that Mexican citizens receive\" at the Irwin County Detention Center.\\nThe ministry said that consulate personnel had interviewed 18 Mexican women who are or were detained at the center, none of whom \"claimed to have undergone a hysterectomy,\" an operation involving the removal of all or part of the uterus.\\nThe department added that seven of the women interviewed had been treated by the doctor accused of performing the sterilizations. Another of the women said she had undergone a gynecological operation, although there was nothing in her file to support that she consented to the procedure.\\nThe women interviewed did not deny that they had been \"victims of bad practices for different reasons,\" the foreign ministry said.\\nIn an article published Tuesday, The New York Times said it had spoken to 16 women with concerns over gynecological treatment they had received while in custody at the Irwin detention facility and asked five independent gynecologists to review the available medical files on each women.\\nThe Times said the independent doctors concluded that the area gynecologist used by the center, Dr. Mahendra Amin, had \"consistently overstated the size or risks associated with cysts or masses attached to his patients\\' reproductive organs.\"\\xa0\\nThe doctors who reviewed the medical files for The Times \"noted that Dr. Amin seemed to consistently recommend surgical intervention, even when it did not seem medically necessary at the time and nonsurgical treatment options were available,\" the newspaper said.\\nMexico announced last week it was investigating the allegations of sterilizations, warning that such operations would be \"unacceptable.\"\\nThe allegations came from a whistleblower, a nurse at the center, where some detainees are held under Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody. The nurse said that detained women told her they did not fully understand why they had to get a hysterectomy.\\nProject South, the Georgia Detention Watch, the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights and South Georgia Immigrant Support Network filed a complaint to the government on behalf of detained immigrants and the nurse.\\nCongresswoman Pramila Jayapal has called for an urgent investigation into allegations that at least 17 women were subjected to unnecessary gynecological procedures that she called \"the most abhorrent of human rights violations.\"\\nICE said when the lawsuit was filed that it does not comment on matters before the inspector general, but that it takes all allegations seriously.\\n\"That said, in general, anonymous, unproven allegations, made without any fact-checkable specifics, should be treated with the appropriate skepticism they deserve,\" the agency said in a statement.\\nDr. Ada Rivera, the top doctor at the agency, issued a statement saying the whistleblower accusations would be investigated by an independent office, \"however, ICE vehemently disputes the implication that detainees are used for experimental medical procedures.\"\\n\"All female ICE detainees receive routine, age-appropriate gynecological and obstetrical health care, consistent with recognized community guidelines for women\\'s health services,\" Rivera said. Her statement also said that, according to ICE data, two detainees at Irwin County Detention Center had had hysterectomies since 2018.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'A divided federal appellate court allowed the Trump administration on Monday to move forward with plans to terminate several humanitarian programs that shield hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the U.S. from deportation.\\nA three-judge panel for the 9th Circuit Court Appeals said it could not second guess the Trump administration\\'s efforts to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for roughly 300,000 immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan. Two Republican-appointed judges on the panel ruled that decisions by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to wind down the TPS programs were not reviewable, setting aside a lower court order that had prevented officials from ending these protections.\\nThrough the 2-1 ruling, the court also rejected the argument that the decisions to end the TPS programs violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution because of President Trump\\'s disparaging comments about immigrants from non-European, predominantly non-white countries. The judges acknowledged Mr. Trump\\'s \"offensive\" comments but did not find a direct link between them and the moves to eliminate TPS protections.\\n\"While we do not condone the offensive and disparaging nature of the President\\'s remarks, we find it instructive that these statements occurred primarily in contexts removed from and unrelated to TPS policy or decisions,\" U.S. Circuit Judge Consuelo Callahan, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote in the majority\\'s opinion.\\nIn her dissent, U.S. Circuit Judge Morgan Christen, who was appointed by President Obama, said the TPS terminations were reviewable and that they violated federal administrative law. Christen also highlighted the \"monumental\" consequences of the majority\\'s ruling, which she called \"deeply flawed.\"\\n\"The importance of the interests at stake make the argument in favor of reviewability even more compelling, because the lives of 300,000 non-citizens and 200,000 U.S. citizen children will be forever changed by these TPS terminations,\" Christen wrote.\\nGiven an agreement between Justice Department lawyers and the groups challenging the end to the humanitarian immigration programs, Monday\\'s ruling also effectively allows the administration to finalize its decisions to terminate TPS designations for Nepal and Honduras.\\nEstablished by Congress in the early 1990s, TPS programs are designed to avoid deporting immigrants to home countries plagued by armed conflict, recovering from natural disasters, dealing with an epidemic or that otherwise can\\'t guarantee the safe return of their citizens.\\nStripping current TPS recipients of their status would make them vulnerable to deportation, but their fate will likely hinge on the outcome of November\\'s presidential election, since the Trump administration has pledged to give immigrants enrolled in the programs 120 days after a favorable court order to end their protections.\\xa0\\nUnder an agreement the Trump administration made with El Salvador\\'s center-right government last fall, the U.S. agreed to give more than 250,000 Salvadoran immigrants with TPS an additional year to live and work in the country after the conclusion of litigation. That compromise came weeks after the Salvadoran government signed an accord allowing the U.S. to reroute non-Salvadoran asylum-seekers from the southern border to El Salvador.\\nDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has vowed to shield TPS holders from deportation to \"unsafe\" countries and to expand the protections to Venezuelans who fled the country\\'s economic collapse.\\nAhilan Arulanantham, the lead lawyer challenging the end to the humanitarian programs, said Monday\\'s ruling means that non-Salvadoran TPS recipients could lose their status as soon as March 5, 2021. TPS protections for Salvadoran immigrants could expire in November 2021, he added.\\nArulanantham, who is also the senior counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union for Southern California, said the end of the TPS programs at the center of the case would present tens of thousands of U.S. citizen children with a \"horrific choice.\"\\n\"It means that those families with American teenagers and kids in grade school and high school and middle school — like Crista Ramos, our lead plaintiff in the case — would be faced with the choice of either separating from their parents and having to move with an uncle or aunt, or leaving to countries like El Salvador, Haiti or Sudan, which they\\'ve never known,\" Arulanantham said.\\xa0\\nArulanantham said his group expects to file a request for the 9th Circuit to reconsider Monday\\'s order through an \"en banc\" vote by 11 judges. If that request is denied, the last recourse for TPS recipients would be an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\\nA Justice Department spokesperson praised Monday\\'s ruling, denouncing the arguments that racial animus played a role in the TPS terminations as \"baseless accusations.\"\\n\"For approximately two years, the district court\\'s injunction prevented the Department of Homeland Security from taking action that Congress has vested solely within the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security — action that is statutorily precluded from judicial review,\" the spokesperson added.\\nClare Hymes contributed to this report.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'The Trump administration has been ordered to continue its 2020 Census population count through October, abandoning plans to end the count ahead of schedule due to COVID-19. A federal judge in California ruled Thursday that the administration\\'s plan would not remedy COVID-19 delays, and instead would result in an inaccurate count that could cause \"irreparable harm.\"\\nThe U.S. Census Bureau, which is overseen by Trump appointee Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, announced in an August 3 press release that it would be ending its count by September 30 — a month before it originally planned — in order to complete data analysis by the end of the year. The Bureau promised to \"improve the speed\" of its count \"without sacrificing completeness.\"\\n\"We will end field data collection by September 30, 2020. Self-response options will also close on that date to permit the commencement of data processing,\" reads the press release. \"Under this plan, the Census Bureau intends to meet a similar level of household responses as collected in prior censuses, including outreach to hard-to-count communities.\"\\nCalifornia District Judge Lucy Koh, however, wrote in a\\xa0preliminary injunction\\xa0Thursday that the Trump administration\\'s \"stated reason for the August 3, 2020 Replan\" — to get the census count to the president by December 31 — is both \"impossible\" and would inflict unnecessary harm on the electorate.\\xa0\\n\"These statements show that the hardship imposed on Defendants from a stay — missing a statutory deadline they had expected to miss anyway — would be significantly less than the hardship on Plaintiffs, who will suffer irreparable harm from an inaccurate census count,\" she wrote.\\xa0\\nThe lawsuit was filed by a coalition of plaintiffs that includes the cities of Los Angeles, Chicago, the Navajo Nation, Black Alliance for Just Immigration, the National Urban League, NAACP, and League of Women Voters.\\xa0\\nKoh further wrote that the bureaus\\'s August 3 press release \"never explains why defendants are \\'required by law\\' to follow a statutory deadline that would sacrifice\" the constitutional requirement to count every person. The Justice Department is expected to appeal Koh\\'s decision.\\nCritics of the shortened timeline also argued that the White House was motivated to end the count early so that President Trump would have access to census results before a potential transfer of power after the November 3 election.\\xa0\\nIn reaction to Koh\\'s decision, Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer, part of the coalition of plaintiffs, said in a statement that \"the Court saw through the Trump Administration\\'s efforts to camouflage its political interference in what is supposed to be the neutral, nonpartisan process of counting every person.\"\\n\"Now, with little time to lose and so much at stake, I urge everyone to take the few moments necessary to be included in the Census,\" Feuer wrote, directing people to fill out the census online.\\xa0\\nThe census is a constitutionally-mandated, once-a-decade count of every single person within the United States. The simple concept has immeasurable impact on our political landscape. Not only does the census determine how many votes each state gets in Congress, it also determines how trillions of federal dollars are divvied up over the next decade.\\nIn-person data collection, a hallmark of the Census, was forced to pause in March due to COVID-19. The temporary suspension prompted the Census Bureau to initially request an\\xa0extension\\xa0for the count. \"In order to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the 2020 Census, the Census Bureau is seeking statutory relief from Congress of 120 additional calendar days to deliver final apportionment counts,\" read an April\\xa0press release from the Bureau.\\nPresident Trump supported the Bureau\\'s request at a press conference later that same day. \"During this difficult time we\\'re also working to ensure that the 2020 Census is completed safely and accuracy,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We may be asking for an extension because obviously they can\\'t be doing very much right now — they wouldn\\'t even be allowed to do it — so the census, we\\'re going to be asking for a delay, a major delay, I think how can you possibly be knocking on doors for a long period of time now?\"\\nThen, despite Mr. Trump\\'s public support for an extension in April, the bureau announced in August that it would instead be speeding up the count.\\nA recent\\xa0report\\xa0from the Department of Commerce\\'s internal watchdog found that the decision was not made by officials within the bureau. Senior officials said they did not know who made the decision, however some \"speculated the decision came from the department, while others thought the decision likely came from the White House.\"\\xa0\\nThe Trump administration has pushed for other controversial changes to the 2020 census.\\xa0\\nEarlier this month, a panel of three federal judges in New York prohibited the president from moving forward with\\xa0plans\\xa0to exclude undocumented immigrants from the count. The judges said the proposal violates federal laws that govern the redrawing of congressional seats and the census count.\\xa0\\nExcluding undocumented immigrants could have potentially seismic political ramifications.

Pointing to the fires set in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the storefronts with smashed windows in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and the shooting of police officers in Los Angeles and Louisville, Kentucky, Mr. Trump\\'s message is clear, that it will not only continue, but will spread to the suburbs if he\\'s not reelected.\\nThe president, who is struggling in the suburbs, particularly among women and college-educated voters, is pressing the argument that Biden can\\'t keep them safe, even though the scenes on television are unfolding during his presidency.\\xa0\\n\"I keep hearing about suburban women, like you, right?\" Mr. Trump said at a rally in Newport News, Virginia, last week, focusing on a woman in the crowd. \"Well, I just ended a regulation that would have allowed projects.

In 2015, she co-authored \"Anxious Politics: Democratic Citizenship in a Threatening World,\" which examined anxiety and politics.\\xa0\\n\"His messaging in 2016 that connected particularly firmly with his base was fear of immigration,\" Albertson said.\\xa0\\n\"Concentrating our anxieties on immigration, that was effective for him in motivating his base,\" she added, noting, \"plenty of people did not see immigration as their top worry in 2016. But yeah, it certainly worked for some of the population.\"\\nBut events have changed, and so has the president\\'s focus.\\xa0\\n\"Instead of these migrant caravans threatening the border, we now hear that Black Lives Matter, and peaceful protests are threatening law and order issues,\" said Professor Darren Davis, professor of political science and the director for the Center for Social Research at the University of Notre Dame. \"So the big caravan, migrant caravan, debate was relevant in 2015, 2016. Protecting our border is no longer being talked about.\"\\xa0\\nYet whatever powers fear and anxiety have over voters, they\\'re not the only forces at work. Take Mr. Trump\\'s reliance on undocumented immigrants as a source of fear in the last presidential election. In 2016, exit polling analysis by CNN showed immigration was the top issue for just 13% of voters. Among those voters, two-thirds voted for Mr. Trump. CBS News\\' analysis found that seven of 10 voters said undocumented immigrants in the U.S. should be allowed to apply for legal status. And yet, among people who supported giving immigrants a path to legal status, one in three voted for Mr. Trump. He may have won in part not because of the fear he inspired about immigrants, but in spite of it.\\nAnxiety is a less predictable indicator for voting than anger, which is a consistent predictor in voting, says Albertson.\\xa0\\n\"When people are anxious about COVID, they\\'re more likely to trust Biden. And so part of what Trump\\'s trying to do is switch the basis of our anxiety,\" said Albertson. \"We see this messaging that what we really need to worry about is the suburbs ... Don\\'t look there, look over here. This is what you ought to be afraid of.\"\\nAlbertson draws a distinction between types of threats. An example of an unframed threat is a terrorist attack, which instills fear regardless of political persuasion. A framed threat is one based on an individual\\'s worldview or politics.\\xa0\\n\"Our framed threats are immigration and climate change,\" Albertson said. \"Some people feel anxious about these things; some people don\\'t. And there are partisan contours both to who feels anxious and who we trust to handle these issues.\"\\nAnxiety, said Michael Neblo, director of the Institute for Democratic Engagement and Accountability at The Ohio State University, causes people to second-guess their thoughts and beliefs.\\xa0\\n\"When people are anxious, they\\'re willing to reconsider their settled views,\" Neblo said. \"And right now, with Biden leading in the polls, the president needs to get people to reconsider things. And anxious people are more willing to to take a second look, and to, you know, really invest some time and energy in evaluating the choices before them.\"\\n\"Some people might react to [Mr. Trump\\'s] appeals to fear with disgust,\" he said. \"And that\\'s going to make them more likely to show up against him. It\\'s not clear that his appeals to fear will necessarily work with the people he needs it work with.\"\\nThe president certainly isn\\'t alone in trying to seize on voters\\' anxieties.\\n\"Both sides use it very effectively,\" said Tom Davis, former congressman from Virginia and former National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) chairman. \"For both sides, fear is always basically the best motivator.\"\\nDemocrats, for instance, warn that Republicans and Mr. Trump will ruin or take away health care, he said. Fear that Republicans would take away the Affordable Health Care Act, as they have threatened, was an effective motivator in 2018, when Democrats took back the House. Biden warned on Sunday that Mr. Trump is trying to \"steal away\" health care protections.\\nThe Supreme Court vacancy\\xa0and nomination of conservative Judge Amy Coney Barrett to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg affords Democrats the ability use the threat of a potential Supreme Court justice who is anti-abortion rights.\\xa0\\n\"Both sides do this with impunity because voters reward it,\" Davis said of both Democrats and Republicans leveraging fear.\\xa0\\nRunning negative ads based on fear about what an opponent would do with power is an effective way to win elections, said the former NRCC chairman, who ran and advised on plenty of races himself. Going positive is only best in the last days leading up to voting, he said.\\xa0\\nUsing anxiety is an unusual approach for an incumbent to take.\\xa0\\n\"Anxiety is the \\'stop and look around and change course if you need to\\' emotion, right?\" Albertson said, pointing out that \"for an incumbent, they want to offer us a stay-the-course kind of narrative, whereas he\\'s offering us more fear.\"\\nBut Davis, the former congressman, said fear and anxiety can \"absolutely\" be effective, even for an incumbent like Mr. Trump.\\xa0\\nBut it remains to be seen whether messages based in fear or anxiety will work well for voters in the middle Mr. Trump desperately needs to win reelection.\\xa0\\n\"In the same way that it riles up his base and makes them more likely to participate, it very well could rile up his opponents and make them all the more committed to getting out and working against him,\" Davis, the professor, said. \"It\\'s not clear to me how it nets out.\"\\nAs Americans are already casting their ballots five weeks out from the election, it\\'s a strategy Mr. Trump needs to work.\\xa0\\n\"He\\'s an incumbent who\\'s losing,\" Neblo said. \"And so it becomes a more complicated balance of the scales.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'In open defiance of state regulations and his own administration\\'s\\xa0pandemic\\xa0health guidelines, President Trump on Sunday hosted his first indoor rally since June, telling a packed, nearly mask-less crowd in Henderson, Nevada that the nation was \"making the last turn\" in defeating the virus.\\nEager to project a sense of normalcy in imagery, Mr. Trump soaked up the raucous cheers inside a warehouse. Relatively few in the crowd wore masks, with one clear exception: Those in the stands directly behind the president, whose images would end up on TV, were mandated to wear face coverings.\\nNot since a\\xa0rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that was blamed\\xa0for a surge of coronavirus infections has he gathered supporters indoors. There was no early mention from Mr. Trump that the pandemic had killed nearly 200,000 Americans and was still claiming 1,000 lives a day.\\n\"We are not shutting the country again. A shutdown would destroy the lives and dreams of millions Americans,\" Mr. Trump said, before using his inflammatory moniker for the coronavirus. \"We will very easy defeat the China virus.\"\\nThe rally in Tulsa, which was his first in three months after the coronavirus reached American shores, was a disaster for the campaign, a debacle that featured a sea of empty seats and a rise in COVID-19 cases, including on his own staff. One prominent Trump supporter at the rally, businessman and former presidential candidate\\xa0Herman Cain, died of COVID-19\\xa0weeks later, though it wasn\\'t clear if he contracted the virus in Tulsa.\\nRecognizing that many supporters were uncomfortable gathering in a large group indoors, where the virus spreads more easily, the Trump campaign shifted to holding smaller, outdoor rallies, usually at airplane hangers. But those rallies have grown in size in recent weeks, with little social distancing and few masks.\\nAnd on Sunday, they returned indoors, in part as a nod to the Las Vegas-area heat. Temperature checks were given to all as they entered the industrial site in Henderson and while masks were encouraged, few wore them.\\nNevada Governor Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, has limited in-person gatherings indoors and outdoors to 50 people since May, a recommendation based on White House reopening guidelines. In a statement released just before the rally began, Sisolak said Mr. Trump was \"taking reckless and selfish actions that are putting countless lives in danger here in Nevada.\"\\n\"To put it bluntly: He didn\\'t have the guts to make tough choices,\" Sisolak said of Mr. Trump\\'s handling of the virus. \"He left that to governors and the states. Now he\\'s decided he doesn\\'t have to respect our state\\'s laws. As usual, he doesn\\'t believe the rules apply to him.\"\\nNevada State Democratic Party spokesperson Madison Mundy released a statement saying Mr. Trump \"willfully endangered Nevadans, all so he could spew lies to fan his own ego. Trump is criminally selfish. This November, Nevadans will reject Trump again and elect real leaders to the White House.\"\\nThe city of Henderson informed Xtreme Manufacturing on Sunday that the event as planned was in direct violation of the governor\\'s COVID-19 emergency directives and that penalties would follow. The Trump campaign pushed back against the restrictions with the president saying he would support those in attendance \"if the governor came after you.\"\\n\"If you can join tens of thousands of people protesting in the streets, gamble in a casino, or burn down small businesses in riots, you can gather peacefully under the 1st Amendment to hear from the President of the United States,\" campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said.\\nTo this point, the campaign hasn\\'t been played out as a choice election between Mr. Trump and his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, but rather a referendum on the president\\'s handling of the coronavirus. By wide margins, Americans have disapproved of Mr. Trump\\'s leadership in that area, as the United States has suffered more deaths than any other nation.\\nHence, the president\\'s campaign believes it needs to change the subject and project the sense, despite evidence otherwise, that the pandemic was winding down and that a vaccine was on the horizon. Part of the plan: Create images of normalcy, like the packed White House lawn for Mr. Trump\\'s convention speech, though it was unclear if viewers were reassured or frightened.\\nIn a rambling, hour-long speech in Henderson, Mr. Trump mused on mandatory prison sentences for flag burning, praised various UFC fighters in attendance and appeared to endorse extradjudicial killings for those who target police officers.\\nHe also unleashed a series of attacks on Biden, labeling him a him a tired career politician and declaring him \"unfit to be president.\"\\nBut, Mr. Trump ruminated, while complaining about the media\\'s coverage: \"Maybe he\\'ll win because they don\\'t like me, they don\\'t like my personality.\" The crowd answered with a deafening \"We love you\" chant.\\nThe rally came the night before Mr. Trump was to travel to California to receive a briefing on the devastating wildfires racing through the region. He\\'s largely been silent on the blazes that have claimed dozens of lives in Oregon and California.\\nEarlier Sunday, Mr. Trump aimed for further inroads with Latinos, who could prove vital in closely contested states that could determine the White House race, promoting economic gains they made before the coronavirus pandemic.\\nThough Mr. Trump has made scores of inflammatory and derogatory comments about Latinos, his campaign is growing confident that he\\'s won some support that could help in Florida, Arizona and Nevada, his target this weekend.\\nWinning support from Latinos has been an uphill climb for the president, whose hard-line immigration policies and sometimes virulent depiction of immigrants have alienated many Hispanics.\\nIn the first moments of his 2016 campaign, he declared that many Mexican immigrants were \"rapists.\" He\\'s drawn criticism for his tepid response to a hurricane that ravaged Puerto Rico, his polices to separate children from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border and his efforts to dismantle an Obama-era program that allows young immigrants living in the country illegally who were brought here as children to remain in the U.S.\\n\"They understand the situation at the southern border. They want people to come in, and so do I, but they want them to do it legally,\" Mr. Trump told a small group of supporters in Las Vegas. \"While Joe Biden has failed, I have delivered for Latinos.\"\\nThere is increasing concern among Democrats that their nominee, the former vice president, has not done enough to court Latino voters. His running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, did little to sway Florida\\'s booming and politically influential Latino population during a stop there this past week. Biden hasn\\'t set foot in Arizona or Nevada during the general election campaign, which he has mainly conducted virtually because of the coronavirus.\\nMr. Trump tailored his pitch to Latinos on Sunday, noting their low unemployment rate before COVID-19 reached American shores and affirming his anti-abortion stance. He again hammered home his recent push on law and order, saying that recent violence in American cities endangered Latinos. He was set to hold a similar event in Arizona on Monday.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'A panel of three federal judges in New York on Thursday prohibited the Trump administration from moving forward with plans to exclude undocumented immigrants from the count used to determine the number of seats states receive in the House of Representatives. The decision temporarily halts an unprecedented proposal with potentially seismic political ramifications.\\nAt the center of Thursday\\'s ruling is a proclamation issued by Mr. Trump in July telling Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, to facilitate the collection of data that would allow him to remove immigrants without legal status from the count used for congressional apportionment. The constitutionally-mandated process to determine the number of House seats each state has occurs every 10 years after the census is taken.\\xa0\\nThe three-judge panel, which convened specifically to hear the case, said the proposal violates federal laws that govern the redrawing of congressional seats and the census count. The judges did not address whether Mr. Trump\\'s directive is constitutional.  \\n\"By directing the Secretary to provide two sets of numbers, one derived from the decennial census and one not, and announcing that it is the policy of the United States to use the latter in connection with apportionment, the Presidential Memorandum deviates from, and thus violates, the statutory scheme,\" the judges wrote. \"Second, the Presidential Memorandum violates the statute governing apportionment because, so long as they reside in the United States, illegal aliens qualify as \"persons in\" a \"State\" as Congress used those words.\"\\nThursday\\'s order stems from a lawsuit mounted by a coalition of states led by New York. The legal challenge is one of several filed against Mr. Trump\\'s directive in federal courts across the country.\\xa0\\n\"The courts have ruled in our favor on every census matter in the last two years and continually rejected President Trump\\'s unlawful efforts to manipulate the census for political purposes,\" New York Attorney General Letitia\\xa0James said in a statement.\\nAccording to an estimate by the Pew Research Center, California, Texas and Florida would get fewer seats than expected in the House of Representatives if Mr. Trump\\'s changes are instituted. Alabama, Minnesota and Ohio, on the other hand, would keep seats they would otherwise have lost.\\nThe Census Bureau\\'s efforts to count people for the 2020 census — which have been hindered by the coronavirus pandemic — are currently underway. Earlier in the month, a federal judge in California blocked the administration from shortening the final deadline to collect census responses, a move advocates say would lead to an undercount, particularly among communities of color.\\nSince the first census was taken in 1790, the U.S. has always counted both citizens and non-citizens, regardless of their immigration status, for the purposes of congressional apportionment. The Constitution stipulates that each state must have at least one representative, and that the apportionment of other seats should be based on an enumeration of the population.\\nUntil the 14th Amendment was ratified in the 1860s, enslaved African Americans were counted as three-fifths of a person for congressional apportionment. American Indians who were classified as \"not taxed\" were excluded until 1940.\\nThe 14th Amendment also requires Representatives to be apportioned based on \"the whole number of persons in each State.\" In his order in July, Mr. Trump said that because \"persons\" is not defined, he has the \"authority to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status.\" Doing so, he added, would uphold the principles of a representative democracy.\\nOfficials at the Census Bureau and the Departments of Justice and Commerce did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday\\'s order, which could be appealed to the U.S Supreme Court.\\nMr. Trump\\'s order in July is part of a broader effort by his administration to change how people in the U.S. are counted in the census and how that data should be used.\\nThe Trump administration first proposed including a question on U.S. citizenship during the 2020 census in March 2018. But its efforts do so, which it said were aimed at enforcing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, elicited a flurry of legal challenges that ended up in the Supreme Court, which blocked the administration from adding the question in time for the questionnaires to be printed.\\nDuring the litigation over the question, it was revealed that Thomas Hofeller, a now deceased conservative political operative, played a role in helping the administration craft the justification for the citizenship question addition, which he said in a 2015 study would allow officials to draw electoral maps advantageous to \"Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.\"\\xa0\\n'},\n",

The hasty and unexplained changes to the Bureau\\'s operations continued in the Replan, created in just 4 to 5 days, risks undermining the Bureau\\'s mission.\"\\nJudge Patrick Bumatay, appointed to the 9th Circuit by President Trump, dissented.\\nThe Census Bureau adopted in April a new census plan in response to the coronavirus pandemic that extended the deadline for each step in the census process. As part of the plan, the bureau expected to ask Congress for an additional 120 days, from December 31 to April, for reporting apportionment counts.\\nBut Congress did not act to extend the deadline for reporting the results to the president, and in early August, the Commerce Department directed the Census Bureau to draft a new plan that allowed for completion of the census by the December 31 statutory deadline. Under the new plan, adopted August 3, the deadline for completion of census field work and data collection was moved up from October 31 to September 30.\\nLate last month, a federal district court in California blocked the Trump administration from implementing the accelerated September 30 end date for field operations. The Justice Department then asked the 9th Circuit to lift the order.\\nThe constitutionally mandated census helps determine how much communities receive in federal funding and the number of congressional seats each state receives. But the 2020 Census has become a political football as the Trump administration has attempted to make changes to this year\\'s population count.\\nIn 2018, Mr. Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross attempted to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, but efforts to do so were rebuffed by the Supreme Court last year. The president also issued a directive in July instructing the Census Bureau to exclude undocumented immigrants from apportionment counts, though that plan has also been halted by federal judges.\\nLast month, the Department of Commerce\\'s Office of the Inspector General found the decision to speed up the 2020 census schedule was not made by officials from the Census Bureau, and some speculated the decision likely came from the White House.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'U.S. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett graduated in 1994 with honors from Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee. But more than 1,500 alumni of the small liberal arts school have made it known they are not proud of their ties to the conservative lawyer and judge. \\nBarrett graduated magna cum laude with an undergraduate degree in English. She was a member of the Honor Council and named the Student Hall of Fame. After her next stop at Notre Dame\\'s law school, Barrett built a career of \"professional distinction and achievement,\" said Rhodes president Marjorie Hass, in a statement issued after President Donald Trump nominated Barrett to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. \\nThe statement was dated September 22. Soon after, Rhodes alumni Rob Marus and Katherine Morgan Breslin wrote a letter criticizing Barrett\\'s stances on abortion law, the LBGTQ community and the Affordable Care Act. Signed by 1,513 alumni and posted online, the letter says the alumni are \"firmly and passionately opposed to her nomination,\" declaring Barrett fails to represent their views and values. \\n\"We are likewise firmly and passionately opposed to Rhodes administrators\\' attempts to embrace Amy Coney Barrett as an alumna of our beloved alma mater,\" the letter said. \"We oppose this embrace because we believe both her record and the process that has produced her nomination are diametrically opposed to the values of truth, loyalty, and service that we learned at Rhodes.\" \\nBarrett\\'s nomination to replace Ginsburg, an abortion rights supporter and liberal icon who died last month, swiftly elicited praise from Republicans and conservatives, and dismay from liberals and Democrats. Opposing sides rained down statements for or against appointing Barrett, currently a Chicago-based federal appeals court judge.  \\nBefore Barrett\\'s time, the school with the stately campus and a total enrollment of about 2,000 students already had a Supreme Court connection. Abe Fortas, class of 1930, became a justice, and Rhodes graduates have clerked for justices and serve as federal judges, Hass said. Rhodes also has hosted on-campus talks by sitting Justice Stephen Breyer and the late Justice Antonin Scalia.  \\n\"Judge Coney Barrett participates in this tradition of academic excellence,\" Hass\\' statement said. \\nBarrett\\'s abortion views are a particular point of contention. Barrett voted at least twice on abortion issues as an appellate judge, both times joining dissenting opinions to decisions that favored abortion rights. \\nThe Rhodes alumni letter was signed by students who graduated as far back as 1959, and some who knew Barrett and were in her graduating class. It expresses concerns that she might vote to overturn or \"seriously curtail\" Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that declared abortion a constitutional right. \\nThe letter accuses her of sidestepping questions about how she would rule if the abortion case were challenged before the Supreme Court. And it claims she has deflected questions about her stance toward the LGBTQ community and her alleged association with an anti-LBGTQ group. \\n\"Amy Coney Barrett has repeatedly shaded the truth about her own views and past associations,\" the letter said. It added that Barrett \"has demonstrated a judicial philosophy and record that fails to serve and protect the vulnerable in our society, including immigrants, those in the criminal justice system, and individuals reliant on the Affordable Care Act.\" \\nIn a subsequent statement following the alumni\\'s letter, Hass encouraged \"all members of the Rhodes community to rise to this moment with courage and to speak, act, and vote in the service of justice.\"  \\n\"I hope that your letter – as well as the support, dissent, and attention it has generated – serves as a spur for robust engagement with the political process,\" Hass wrote. She stood by her previous letter and public remarks praising Barrett\\'s \"exceptional record of academic achievement\" at Rhodes.  \\n\"The college will continue to speak of her with respect and friendship,\" Hass wrote. Later, she added, she was \"happy to re-affirm my own commitment and the commitment of the college to stand against bigotry and for the rights of minority and marginalized students and alumni.\" \\nBarrett had no public comments on the letter.  \\nMr. Trump said during Tuesday\\'s debate with Democratic challenger Joe Biden that he doesn\\'t know Barrett\\'s views on Roe v. Wade and didn\\'t discuss them with her when they met at the White House three days after Ginsburg\\'s death.  \\nMarus, co-author of the alumni letter, told The Associated Press the letter\\'s signees were upset and concerned the college\\'s reputation could be diminished in the eyes of potential and current students who disagree with Barrett and Mr. Trump. He called her views \"antediluvian,\" adding some alumni are terrified of any lifetime appointment for Barrett to the court.  \\n\"We thought it was time to speak out,\" said Marus. \"We never thought we\\'d change how the Senate voted on her. What we wanted to affect was public perception of Rhodes, the education we received there.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'The U.S. Census Bureau for now must stop winding down operations in order to finish the 2020 census at the end of September, according to a federal judge\\'s order. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, issued a temporary restraining order late Saturday against the Census Bureau and the Commerce Department, which oversees the agency. The order stops the Census Bureau from winding down operations until a court hearing is held on September 17.\\nThe once-a-decade headcount of every U.S. resident helps determine how $1.5 trillion in federal funding is distributed and how many congressional seats each state gets in a process known as apportionment.\\n The temporary restraining order was requested by a coalition of cities, counties and civil rights groups that had sued the Census Bureau, demanding it restore its previous plan for finishing the census at the end of October, instead of using a revised plan to end operations at the end of September. The coalition had argued the earlier deadline would cause the Census Bureau to overlook minority communities in the census, leading to an inaccurate count.\\n Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Census Bureau pushed back ending the count from the end of July to the end of October and asked Congress to extend the deadline for turning in the apportionment numbers from December, as required by law, into next spring. When the Republican-controlled Senate failed to take up the request, the bureau was forced to create a revised schedule that had the census ending in September, according to the statistical agency.\\n The lawsuit contends the Census Bureau changed the schedule to accommodate a directive from President Trump to exclude people in the country illegally from the numbers used in redrawing congressional districts. The revised plan would have the Census Bureau handing in the apportionment numbers at the end of December, under the control of the Trump administration no matter who wins the election in November.\\n More than a half dozen other lawsuits have been filed in tandem across the country, challenging Mr. Trump\\'s memorandum as unconstitutional and an attempt to limit the power of Latinos and immigrants of color during apportionment.\\n \"The court rightfully recognized the Trump administration\\'s attempted short-circuiting of our nation\\'s census as an imminent threat to the completion of a fair and accurate process,\" said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers\\' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, one of the groups that brought the San Jose lawsuit.\\n In her order, Koh wrote that previous court cases had concluded that it\\'s in the public interest that Congress be fairly apportioned and that the federal funds be distributed using an accurate census.\\n \"Thus, the balance of the hardships and public interest tip sharply in Plaintiffs\\' favor,\" Koh said.\\n Neither the White House nor the Commerce Department had immediate comment.\\nIn a message emailed to regional offices and headquarters late Saturday, the Census Bureau said the statistical agency and the Commerce Department \"are obligated to comply with the Court\\'s Order and are taking immediate steps to do so.\" Further guidance would be provided later, the bureau said.\\nA top Census Bureau official said in court papers filed late Friday that the bureau wouldn\\'t be able to meet its deadline to turn in apportionment numbers at the end of December if the head count were extended an extra month.\\nAssociate director Al Fontenot said it would be difficult to bring back census takers who had been laid off if the bureau was forced to go back to the plan that has the head count ending in October, and that the current crop of census takers had been much more efficient than in past decades, enabling the count to end on the faster timetable.\\nAs of Saturday, more than 86% of households had been counted. More than 65% of households were counted from self-reponses online, by mail or by telephone, and 21% of households were counted by census takers who went to households that hadn\\'t yet answered the questionnaire.\\nSome census takers have been laid off and operations wound down as 85% of households in an area have been counted in what is known as the \"closeout\" phase, and starting September 11, it will be up to the supervisors to wind down operations in an area even if it hasn\\'t achieved the 85% threshold, Fontenot said.\\nSome steps also have been eliminated in the processing phase that will take place between when the count ends and when the apportionment numbers must be turned in, increasing the risk for errors, but the \"Census Bureau is confident that it can achieve a complete and accurate census and report apportionment counts,\" Fontenot said in the court papers.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'This year has been, yet again, historically grim when it comes to wildfires burning in the western U.S. In Oregon alone, at least 10 people lost their lives, tens of thousands were evacuated, and over a million acres burned.\\nOf the many people affected, there was one you might not have expected: actor Jim Belushi. \"The devastation, it\\'s just changed the community,\" he told correspondent Luke Burbank as they surveyed the damage. \"It\\'s just a graveyard here.\"\\nBelushi lives along the Rogue River in Eagle Point, Oregon. \"The fires were way up there by that hill. And so we used this hose to hose the house down, hose the grass, and hose the field down and keep a little water break.\"\\nIt\\'s a place he first visited some ten years ago on a family vacation: \"One day I went into the river, skinny-dipping. And it was like a baptism. That was the start.\"\\nSo, he bought an old Elk\\'s Lodge picnic grounds, built a house, built a sweat lodge (\"Oh yeah. I am, like, a little shaman, you know?\"), and eventually bought the neighboring farm, which is when things got a little trippy.\\nThat\\'s right: Belushi started a cannabis farm, all of which is being documented on a new reality show, \"Growing Belushi,\" on Discovery Go. \\n\"I am SO obsessed,\" Belushi said. \"It\\'s like talking to you right now, my eyes are watching for squirrels and gophers. These pests eat the plants. Aphids, Rusick mites. You are doing battle with Mother Nature.\"\\nBelushi is involved every step of the way, from the greenhouse (\"The air has to constantly be circulating\"), to the drying room, to the finished product. And he dotes on the ladybugs that eat aphids. \"I love them! I personify them. I give them names. I play music for them. And I believe if you love them, they will move on to the world and love others, and help them.\"\\nIf you\\'re wondering where this Hollywood actor got his work ethic, it was from washing dishes at his father\\'s restaurant in Chicago. The Belushis lived in Wheaton, Illinois, where they were some of the only Albanian immigrants. \"I wouldn\\'t let my friends come in the house,\" he recalled, \"because you\\'d open up the door and you can smell liver and onions cooking and I\\'m like, \\'Uhhh, you know, just wait outside. I\\'ll be right out.\\'\"\\nJimmy, as he was known then, grew up in the very large shadow of his older brother, John Belushi\" \"John looked like Dustin Hoffman in \\'The Graduate\\' in a senior picture, you know? Honor Society, prom king. He had it all going for him. He left no room for me. So, I was the star criminal, the star troublemaker. I was on probation from the ages of 13 to 18.\"\\nJim was inspired to try acting after watching his brother perform at Second City and \"Saturday Night Live. \" As Jim Belushi was working his way up the comedy ladder, John Belushi had become arguably one of the biggest stars in the world. \\nThen, in March of 1982, John died in Los Angeles. He was just 33. \"Part of it was not just losing the sibling, part of it was losing a sibling to drug overdose,\" said Jim. \"It just breaks the family up. It\\'s like throwing a hand grenade in the family.\"\\nBurbank said, \"Danny Aykroyd, I think, famously said that if your brother had been a pothead, he might still be alive?\"\\n\"Well, that made me think for a long time, and that actually set me on this journey,\" Jim said. \\nIn the nearly four decades since John Belushi\\'s passing, it\\'s actually been Jim Belushi who\\'s become a huge star. But hanging out on the farm with him, you can\\'t help but think that it might be this role, of cannabis farmer, that\\'s the one he was born to play – and one that let him help put the past in the past. \\nHe told Burbank, \"The beautiful, thing about farming is that you\\'re in the ground. under the sun. And it\\'s just, it roots you. It literally grounds you.\"\\nTo Belushi, these cannabis plants have become almost like family – family that came within three miles of burning to the ground. So, when he got an opportunity last week to thank the first responders who helped fight those fires to a free steak lunch, he jumped at the chance, in the most Belushi way possible – by literally jumping on a table. \\nHe told those assembled, \"I wanna thank all you men and women for not only putting yourself on the line, but being on the line to save and help this community. And we\\'re going to continue and help rebuild, so thank you so much! You like the meat?\"\\n\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0For more info:\\n\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Story produced by Anthony Laudato.

       "  'body': 'Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the longest serving woman on the U.S. Supreme Court and a strong liberal voice on issues dividing the nation, has died, the Supreme Court said on Friday. She was 87.\\n\"Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died this evening surrounded by her family at her home in Washington, D.C., due to complications of metastatic pancreas cancer,\" the Court said in a statement.\\nChief Justice John Roberts, a longtime friend of Ginsburg\\'s, called her a \"jurist of historic stature.\"\\n\"We at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague,\" Roberts said. \"Today we mourn, but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her — a tireless and resolute champion of justice.\"\\nGinsburg revealed in July 2020 that she was undergoing chemotherapy for a recurrence of cancer. She had previously been treated for four bouts with cancer over the years, including a pancreatic tumor in 2019 and growths in her lung in 2018.\\nHer death leaves a vacancy on the Supreme Court that is sure to set off an intense partisan battle over her replacement, as a conservative Trump nominee could tip the balance in closely divided cases.\\nGinsburg was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Bill Clinton in 1993. She was only the second woman in U.S. history elevated to the high court, after Sandra Day O\\'Connor, who was named by President Reagan in 1981.\\nShe grew up in Brooklyn, New York, in the 1930s and 40s. She graduated from Cornell University and then in 1956, enrolled at Harvard Law School, where she was one of just nine women in a class of about 500. She juggled her studies with taking care of her first child.\\nWhen her husband, Martin Ginsburg, got a job at a New York law firm, they moved back to the city and she completed her degree at Columbia Law School. But despite graduating at the top of her class, the job market wasn\\'t welcoming.\\n\"There was not a single firm in the entire city of New York that would offer me a job,\" she recalled. She said she had three strikes against her: she was Jewish, a woman, and perhaps the ultimate deal-breaker, a mother.\\n\"Legal employers were afraid ... that I would be staying home more than I was showing up for work,\" she said.\\nOf course, she proved them wrong, building an impressive career as a law professor, founding director of the Women\\'s Rights Project of the ACLU, and federal judge.\\nHer work with the Women\\'s Rights Project in the 1970s had a far-reaching impact. She argued six landmark cases on gender equality before the U.S. Supreme Court, winning five of them to eliminate legal barriers that held women back in the workplace and civic life. She strategically advanced cases that would establish precedents for treating men and women equally under the law in such areas as jury duty requirements, Social Security and military spousal benefits, and even the legal drinking age.\\n\"She is to the women\\'s movement what former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall was to the movement for the rights of African-Americans,\" then-President Clinton said when he nominated her to fill the Supreme Court seat being vacated by retiring Justice Byron White.\\n\"I am proud to nominate this path-breaking attorney, advocate, and judge,\" he said, portraying her as a nonpartisan choice. \"Ruth Bader Ginsburg cannot be called a liberal or a conservative; she has proved herself too thoughtful for such labels.\"\\xa0\\nGinsburg won Senate confirmation by a vote of 96 to 3.\\n\"Her 27 years on the Court exceeded even my highest expectations when I appointed her,\" Mr. Clinton said in a statement following her death. \"Her landmark opinions advancing gender equality, marriage equality, the rights of people with disabilities, the rights of immigrants, and so many more moved us closer to \\'a more perfect union\\'.\"\\nShe has described her approach to the law as cautious and measured, but over a quarter-century on the high court she assembled a track record of decisions placing her firmly in the court\\'s liberal wing. She supported abortion rights, marriage equality, the Affordable Care Act, and women seeking restitution for unequal pay.\\nRuth Bader Ginsburg: Her view from the bench\\nConservatives criticized her for straying too far from the Founding Fathers\\' original meaning of the Constitution. But when CBS News\\' Mike Wallace pointed out to her in a 2006 interview that the Constitution never mentioned abortion or same-sex marriage, she responded: \"Think back to 1787. Who were \\'we the people\\'? … They certainly weren\\'t women … they surely weren\\'t people held in human bondage. The genius of our Constitution is that over now more than 200 sometimes turbulent years that \\'we\\' has expanded and expanded.\"\\nDespite their very different ideological views, Ginsburg became close friends with the fiery conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016. They loved attending the opera together and even took to the stage as extras.\\nGinsburg was treated for cancer multiple times — undergoing colon cancer surgery in 1999, an operation for early-stage pancreatic cancer in 2009, having tumors removed from her lung in 2018, radiation for a pancreatic tumor in 2019 and chemotherapy in the spring and summer of 2020. Yet she repeatedly insisted she had no intention of retiring as long as she could do the job \"full steam,\" and she rarely missed a day of work. To keep up her stamina she worked out with a personal trainer and became renowned for her notoriously tough fitness routine.\\nWhen her husband of 56 years, Martin Ginsburg, died in 2010, she was back on the bench the next day. She credited their long and happy marriage to a piece of advice she once received from her mother-in-law.\\n\"She said, \\'Dear, in every good marriage it helps sometimes to be a little deaf\\',\" Ginsburg said. \"And I followed that advice in dealing not only with my dear spouse but in dealing even with my colleagues on the U.S. Supreme Court.\"\\nGinsburg achieved an unexpected measure of pop culture stardom in her later years, when a blog and online memes celebrating the soft-spoken, elderly Justice as the \"Notorious R.B.G.\" went viral, leading to a best-selling biography by the same name.\\xa0\\nOne of the book\\'s authors, Irin Carmon, told Rolling Stone in 2017, \"When people ask us, \\'Why are young women inspired by RBG?\\' to us it\\'s such an obvious question that it\\'s hard to answer. We live in a society that most of the time really stigmatizes ideals of gender equality and feminism, and there\\'s this woman who has for decades been using her power in the highest court of the land for good. That\\'s a really big deal.\"\\nA documentary film, \"RBG,\" and a Hollywood dramatization of her story, \"On the Basis of Sex,\" helped cement Ginsburg\\'s image as a crusader in the popular imagination.\\xa0\\nGinsburg herself expressed a more modest view of a Supreme Court justice\\'s role: \"Judges are something like firefighters.

The final toll is expected to be much higher.

A mobile home park, houses and businesses were burned, leaving twisted remains on charred ground.\\nMany of the residents were immigrants, with few resources to draw on.\\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency estimated that 600 homes were burned by the fire that started in Ashland and tore through Phoenix, the Mail Tribune of Medford reported.\\nOregon officials haven\\'t released an exact death count for the wildfires but at least four fatalities have been reported in the state.

Mr. Trump didn\\'t disclose how much he paid in either federal or state income taxes.\\xa0\\nSince entering the White House, Mr. Trump has broken with tradition set by his predecessors by not only refusing to release his tax returns but by waging a legal battle to keep them hidden. The Times report suggests why that might have been so. It reported that many of Mr. Trump\\'s top businesses are losing money, losses that have helped him shrink his federal tax bill to essentially nothing.\\nEugene Steuerle, a tax expert at the Urban Institute, said he wasn\\'t surprised that it turns out that Mr. Trump had paid almost no federal income tax. Most commercial real estate developers deduct large interest payments on their debts from taxable income, thereby lowering their tax bills. Typically, they also often avoid capital gains taxes by plowing profits from the sale of one building into the purchase of another.\\n\"Most tax experts expected you would find little in the way of tax payments by President Trump,\" said Steuerle, who served as a Treasury Department official under President Ronald Reagan.\\nThe Times noted that Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said of the Times report that \"most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate\" and asked for the documents on which the reporting was based, which the Times declined to provide in order to protect its sources. The Times said Garten then directly disputed only the amount of taxes Mr. Trump had paid.\\nHere are seven key takeaways from the Times\\' reporting:\\nThe newspaper said Mr. Trump initially paid $95 million in taxes over the 18 years it studied. But he managed to recover most of that money by claiming — and receiving — a stunning $72.9 million federal tax refund. According to the Times, Mr. Trump also pocketed $21.2 million in state and local refunds, which are typically based on federal filings.\\nMr. Trump\\'s outsize refund became the subject of a now-long-standing Internal Revenue Service audit of his finances. The audit was widely known. Trump has claimed it was the very reason why he cannot release his returns. But the Times report is the first to identify the issue that was mainly in dispute.\\nAs a result of the refund, Mr. Trump paid an annual average $1.4 million in federal taxes from 2000 to 2017, the Times reported. By contrast, the average U.S. taxpayer in the top .001% of earners paid about $25 million annually over the same time frame.\\nHis tax returns also reveal that he\\'s failed to repay $287 million to his lenders since 2010, which the Times says is far more than previously known. While the IRS treats forgiven debt as income, Mr. Trump avoided paying taxes on much of that money through tax maneuvers.\\xa0\\nFrom his homes, his aircraft — and $70,000 on hair styling during his television show \"The Apprentice\" — Trump has capitalized on cost incurred from his businesses to finance a luxurious lifestyle.\\nThe Times noted that Mr. Trump\\'s homes, planes and golf courses are part of the Trump family business and, as such, Trump classified them as business expenses as well. Because companies can write off business expenses as deductions, all such expenses have helped reduce Trump\\'s tax liability.\\nMr. Trump\\'s Seven Springs estate in Westchester County, New York is a 50,000-square-foot mansion set on more than 200 acres. But because he classifies it as an investment property, Mr. Trump is able to write off the estate\\'s $2.2 million in property taxes as a business expense. Eric Trump, one of Mr. Trump\\'s sons, has described the property as \"home base for us for a long, long time,\" while the Trump Organization describes the property as a \"retreat\" for the Trump family.\\xa0\\nAt the same time, the tax overhaul signed into law by Mr. Trump in 2017 limits taxpayers to $10,000 in deductions for state and local taxes, which includes property taxes.\\xa0\\nThe president has frequently pointed to his far-flung hotels, golf courses and resorts as evidence of his success as a developer and businessman. Yet these properties have been hemorrhaging money.\\nThe Times reported that Mr. Trump has claimed $315 million in losses since 2000 on his golf courses, including the Trump National Doral near Miami, which Mr. Trump has portrayed as a crown jewel in his business empire. Likewise, his Trump International Hotel in Washington has lost $55 million, the Times reported.\\nSince Mr. Trump began his presidential run, lobbyists, foreign governments and politicians have lavished significant sums of money on his properties, a spending spree that raised questions about its propriety and legality.\\nThe Times report illustrates just how much that spending has been: Since 2015, his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida has taken in $5 million more a year from a surge in membership. The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association spent at least $397,602 in 2017 at Trump\\'s Washington hotel. Overseas projects have produced millions more for Mr. Trump — $3 million from the Philippines, $2.3 million from India and $1 million from Turkey.\\nMr. Trump wrote off about $26 million in unexplained \"consulting fees\" as a business expense across many of his projects, the New York Times reported.\\xa0\\nWhile the \"consultants\" aren\\'t identified on the tax returns, the consulting fees claimed as tax deductions in some cases match exactly what Ivanka Trump claimed as income in her financial disclosures. For instance, Ivanka Trump reported receiving $747,622 in payments from a consulting company she co-owned, the same amount that Mr. Trump claimed as a tax deduction for two hotel projects.\\xa0\\nAt the same time Ivanka Trump was an executive officer of the Trump companies, she both profited from the hotels and the consulting fees, the Times story noted. The IRS in the past has pursued penalties against some companies that have sought to avoid taxes by paying consulting fees to people who weren\\'t, in fact, independent contractors, the report noted.\\xa0\\nThe maneuver helps companies sidestep payroll taxes, noted the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.\\nMr. Trump earned $427.4 million from his reality show \"The Apprentice\" from 2010 to 2018, as well as from licensing deals from everything from clothing to mattress companies. But that revenue started to dry up when he ran for president and made derogatory comments about immigrants, which cost him two of his most lucrative deals along with tens of millions in revenue from the Miss Universe pageant which NBC announced it would no longer broadcast.\\xa0\\nIndeed, Mr. Trump\\'s brand appears to be the most successful part of his business. During the same period the \"The Apprentice\" was on the air, the businesses that Mr. Trump ran lost almost $175 million, the Times reported.\\nMr. Trump seems sure to face heavy financial pressures from the enormous pile of debt he has absorbed. The Times said the president appears to be responsible for $421 million in loans, most of which will come due within four years. On top of that, a $100 million mortgage on Trump Tower in New York will come due in 2022.\\nQuotes delayed at least 15 minutes.\\nMarket data provided by ICE Data Services. ICE Limitations.

       "  'body': 'This year has not been a normal year for movies – or for film festivals, either. Truth be told, we\\'re lucky to have any kind of film festival during the year of COVID-19 — and after months of lockdown, virtually streaming films, press conferences and filmmaker talks doesn\\'t seem all that odd.\\nWhat\\'s more, because this year\\'s New York Film Festival has gone virtual, audiences from around the country can partake in its offerings, which wasn\\'t the case when screenings were limited to theatres in Manhattan. In addition to online offerings, many films are also being shown at \"drive-in\" venues in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, allowing for proper social distancing.\\xa0\\nWith no competition or awards getting in the way, the New York Film Festival has traditionally been one of the best-curated festivals, featuring U.S. or New York premieres of internationally-acclaimed movies by some of the most invigorating filmmakers. Launching last week, the festival will continue through October 11, with each film available for screening online prior to its standard release — or what counts for a standard release in these times.\\nEven if you miss a virtual screening, you can catch illuminating conversations with filmmakers on the Film at Lincoln Center YouTube Channel, such as this chat with the director Sofia Coppola and actors Bill Murray, Rashida Jones and Marlon Wayans of the comedy \"On the Rocks\":\\nBelow are a few of the festival highlights that have already been previewed, along with promising coming attractions. The list will be updated as more films screen for the press.\\n\"Lovers Rock\" – This 70-minute film by Steve McQueen (\"12 Years a Slave\"), packaged as part of a series of films titled \"Small Axe\" but actually a standalone story, recreates the atmosphere of a 1980 house party of West Indian immigrants in London. We see the preparations, almost smell the food cooking, and witness as men and women congregate, dance, enjoy reggae music and each other. There is no real script per se, and the characters do not cut deep, but there is a tactile feel for the period, through the clothes, music and décor, while the male-female tensions are timeless. A notable scene: the dancers sing a capella, proving you don\\'t even need a DJ to feel enraptured by music. Kudos to cinematographer Shabier Kirchner. \\xa0Screens October 3-5. \\nTwo additional episodes of McQueen\\'s \"Small Axe\" anthology – \"Mangrove\" and \"Red, White and Blue\" – will screen October 3-5. \"Small Axe\" will be released by Amazon Studios November 30. \\nTo watch a trailer for the \"Small Axe\" anthology click on the video player below:\\n\"Nomadland\" – Director Chloé Zhao\\'s last entry to the New York Film Festival, 2017\\'s \"The Rider,\" was a somber and moving testament to a fading Western character – a quasi-biographical depiction of a Lakota rodeo rider recovering from a near-fatal injury. In her new narrative feature, Zhao again blurs fiction and non-fiction in a story inspired by journalist Jessica Bruder\\'s \"Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century,\" an account of nomadic van dwellers eking out a life amid the fallout of the 2008 economic crash. Frances McDormand stars as Fern, a widow who clung onto life in a Nevada backwater until the mine shut down, and with it the town. Living out of a van, she shuttles from state to state, job to job, living an itinerate life among similarly nomadic seniors whose quasi-retirement resides on a razor\\'s edge of personal fulfillment on their own terms and despair. Zhao\\'s direction is finely attuned to those on the margins, with a cast that includes some of the real-life people documented in Bruder\\'s book, while McDormand brings a stoic self-assuredness to her performance of a woman ill at ease with accepting others\\' characterizations of her situation; she\\'ll be the final arbiter of what\\'s right for her, thank you. Screens September 26. To be released by Searchlight Pictures December 4.\\nTo watch a teaser for \"Nomadland\" click on the video player below:\\n\"MLK/FBI\" – Sam Pollard\\'s documentary examines the efforts of U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the 1950s and \\'60s to surveil or infiltrate the civil rights movement and its most prominent leader, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Available to stream through September 26. An IFC Films release.\\nWatch a clip from \"MLK/FBI\":\\n\"Night of the Kings\" – The inmates who run a prison in the Ivory Coast welcome a new prisoner who has been chosen to be their \"Roman\" (or storyteller), with the responsibility of telling a tale, Scheherazade-like, during the blood-red moon, or risk death. Director Philippe Lacôte\\'s staging evokes the traditions of West African griot storytelling and modernist theatrical productions, as Roman tells the tragic life story of a noted criminal figure, a tale replete with superstition, magic and fated death. Screens virtually through September 29, with a drive-in screening September 30. A Neon release.\\nTo watch a clip from \"Night of the Kings\" click on the player below: \\n\"City Hall\" – The work of documentary filmmaker Frederick Wiseman is recognizable for his fly-on-the-wall technique of shooting and editing, with no appreciable editorial influence, except that Wiseman\\'s arm\\'s-length (and lengthy) movies engulf the viewer in a host of interpersonal dynamics while its protagonists are caught in seemingly impersonal bureaucracies. In his latest, \"City Hall,\" Wiseman delves into the myriad challenges facing a city government — in this case Boston\\'s — whose mayor, officials and civil servants are engaged in the work of everyday life, from marrying couples, paving streets and explaining budgetary pressures to constituents, to witnessing citizens under stress demanding social services. The four-and-a-half-hour length covers a lot of ground, and by the end of it, no one should be dismissive about what good government does, if the people in charge are in tune to the needs of citizens. Screens through September 30. A Zipporah Films release.\\nTo watch a trailer for \"City Hall\" click on the player below. \\nFrom among the festival\\'s other films not yet previewed at press time, here are some intriguing offerings: \\n\"Time\" – Garrett Bradley\\'s emotional documentary follows a determined Louisiana woman fighting for decades for her husband\\'s release from prison after he was sentenced to 60 years for robbery. Screens September 25.\\xa0 An Amazon Studios release.\\n\"Hopper/Welles\" – The producer and editor who restored Orson Welles\\' \"The Other Side of the Wind\" resurrect 1970 footage of a conversation between Welles and actor-director Dennis Hopper, two filmmakers then on alternately declining and rising trajectories in Hollywood, who discuss the life of an independent artist in an industry not known for welcoming auteurs. Screens September 28-October 3. \\n\"The Disciple\" – A young musician seeks fulfillment in his pursuit of performing Khayal Indian music, in a world where commercialization increasingly overwhelms tradition. Screens September 29-October 6.\\n\"The Woman Who Ran\" – A South Korean woman experiences visits with her friends without, for once, her husband in tow, in this comedy devoid of men. Screens October 2-7. A Cinema Guild release.\\n\"David Byrne\\'s American Utopia\" – Spike Lee directed this filmed rendition of Byrne\\'s recent Broadway concert, spilling over with timeless Talking Heads tunes. Screens October 4-9. An HBO release. \\n\"The Truffle Hunters\" – A documentary about dogs in Italy who lead their elderly owners to a supreme prize: the precious white Alba truffle. Screens October 5. A Sony Pictures Classics release.\\n\"Notturno\" – Gianfranco Rosi (director of the Oscar-nominated documentary \"Fire at Sea\") presents a meditation on persistence amid the shattered landscapes of Iraq, Kurdistan, Lebanon and Syria, in schools and hospitals, and in the ordinary rhythms of work for those whose lives have been torn by war. Screens October 6-11.\\xa0\\n\"Undine\" – German director Christian Petzold (\"Transit,\" \"Phoenix,\" \"Barbara\") returns to the festival with a romance tinged with supernatural undertones. Screens October 9-14. An IFC Films release.\\n\"French Exit\" – Facing impending insolvency, socialite Michelle Pfeiffer and her son Lucas Hedges flee to Paris, because, why not? Screens October 10. A Sony Pictures Classics release.\\nThe festival also features restorations and revivals of classic films, including William Klein\\'s documentary of boxer Cassius Clay, \"Muhammad Ali, the Greatest\"; Bela Tarr\\'s \"Damnation\"; Wong Kar Wei\\'s \"In the Mood for Love\"; Joyce Chopra\\'s \"Smooth Talk\"; Ivan Dixon\\'s \"The Spook Who Sat by the Door\"; and Jean Vigo\\'s \"Zero for Conduct.\"\\nClick here for the festival\\'s schedule of conversations with filmmakers. \\nThese films\\' festival screenings have already expired, but they are worth watching for: \\n\"On the Rocks\" – Director Sofia Coppola reunites with her \"Lost in Translation\" star Bill Murray for another disjointed romance. Here he stars as the father of Rashida Jones, a married mother of two who suspects her husband of having an affair. \\xa0Murray (who plays Bill Murray better than anyone) assumes the role of detective to try to catch his son-in-law in the act, while at the same time confirming his worst insecurities about women and the emotional detachment of males. Coppola\\'s ear, and her eye for New York City, is winning. An Apple/A24 release.\\nTo watch a trailer for \"On the Rocks\" click on the player below:\\n\"The Monopoly of Violence\" – Director David Dufresne\\'s powerful documentary combines talking heads with intense video footage to produce a thoughtful treatise on the legitimacy of violence, whether it is wielded by the state (via the police), or by the hands of demonstrators. Centered on the \"yellow jacket\" protests for social justice that occurred in France between November 2018 and February 2020, the film features interviews with law professors, social activists, demonstrators and police officials, who serve as witnesses to video footage shot of confrontations on the streets of Paris and other cities. The debate over use of preventative arrests and non-lethal force (in which projectiles can still maim for life) is heated, and extends far beyond the points of public anger that launched the protests in the first place, and to the very roots of democracy (and its more authoritarian cousin, what one subject dubs a \"democ-tatorship\").\\xa0 U.S. distributor to be announced.\\nTo watch a trailer for \"The Monopoly of Violence\" click on the player below:\\nFor more info:\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'At least 8,800 migrant children who arrived at the southern border without their parents have been swiftly expelled from the country and denied U.S. refuge during the pandemic under an emergency policy, the Trump administration told a federal court on Friday.\\nIn addition to the unaccompanied minors, approximately 7,600 members of migrant families with children have been expelled from the U.S.-Mexico border since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a public health order authorizing these expulsions in mid-March.\\xa0\\nWith single adults accounted for, more than 159,000 expulsions have been carried out under the unprecedented restrictions, which the Trump administration says are designed to avert coronavirus outbreaks inside migrant holding facilities and among the broader U.S. population.\\n\"The numbers are stunning,\" Lindsay Toczylowski, the executive director of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, told CBS News. \"Having talked to so many kids who come here seeking asylum and knowing the fear that they have and what they\\'re fleeing, to find out that our government has literally taken children who are seeking protection and sent them back to the very places they fled in such high numbers really took my breath away.\"\\nCiting the CDC order, U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials have suspended humanitarian protections for most border-crossers, arguing that public health law overrides asylum, immigration and anti-trafficking safeguards during a pandemic. Instead of placing migrants in regular deportation proceedings and transferring most unaccompanied children to the U.S. refugee agency, which is required under a 2008 anti-trafficking law, border officials have been making rapid expulsions.\\nThe previously undisclosed figures were revealed in documents the Trump administration submitted as part of an emergency request for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to stay a lower court order from last week. That ruling ordered the government to stop holding migrant children in hotel rooms before expelling them.\\nDuring the pandemic, the Trump administration has expanded its use of hotels to detain migrant minors whom it seeks to expel from the country under the CDC order. Some unaccompanied children and minors apprehended with their parents wait in these hotels, where they are supervised by private Immigration and Customs Enforcement contractors, while ICE officials arrange for them to be expelled to their home countries via deportation flights.\\xa0\\nMost single adult migrants processed under the CDC directive have been turned back directly to Mexico.\\nAccording to the figures revealed Friday, nearly 7,000 families with minors and more than 6,500 unaccompanied children were expelled by land to Mexico. Border Patrol also transferred 2,200 unaccompanied children and 600 families to ICE so the agency could expel them on repatriation flights.\\xa0\\nSince the CDC\\'s order implementation, 1,600 family members and 1,500 unaccompanied minors have been allowed to undergo regular immigration proceedings after crossing the southern border, according to Friday\\'s court documents.\\nLast week, Judge Dolly Gee of the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles said the secretive border hotel detention system violated the Flores Settlement Agreement, which governs the care of all minors in U.S. immigration custody. She said the hotels lack sufficient oversight, state licenses to hold minors, standards for the care of young children and an adequate process for migrants to seek counsel from lawyers. Gee ordered DHS to wind down its large-scale hotel detention system by next Tuesday.\\nIn their emergency request on Friday, Justice Department lawyers said Gee\\'s order would undermine the Trump administration\\'s efforts to contain the coronavirus.\\xa0\\n\"The district court\\'s order requires that all minors and families who would have been held in individual rooms in a hotel, and then expelled under the CDC order, must now instead be placed into congregate settings regardless of the CDC Director\\'s judgments and regardless of the limitations on the government\\'s ability to maintain appropriate infection-control measures in those settings. That is wrong,\" the Justice Department lawyers wrote.\\nTrump administration officials said Gee\\'s ruling could overburden ICE detention facilities for families, as well as shelters administered by the Office of Refugee Resettlement to house unaccompanied minors. Border officials said the order could lead them to refer between 60 and 140 more migrant children to the refugee agency per week.\\nIn a court declaration, Deputy Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz said the inability to hold minors in hotels would likely require his agents to detain families and unaccompanied children in holding stations designed for single adults for longer periods of time. That could increase the risk of coronavirus transmission among migrants and Border Patrol personnel, Ortiz said.\\nAt least 2,018 Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel have tested positive for the coronavirus, and a dozen employees and one contractor have died of complications from the virus, according to the court declaration.\\nJallyn Sualog, the deputy director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, said an influx of hundreds of migrant children would hinder efforts to contain the coronavirus inside the agency\\'s network of shelters and housing facilities, which were holding 1,097 minors as of early this week. The agency has the capacity to house more than 13,000 children, but Sualog said the system would be under \"significant stress\" if it receives more than 100 minors per week.\\n\"ORR will gradually lose the extra space that must be held in reserve to quarantine or isolate UAC as needed, and ORR will be forced to house UAC in denser conditions, which will further increase the risk of transmission of COVID-19,\" Sualog wrote in her declaration, referring to migrant minors through the \"unaccompanied alien children\" (UAC) legal term.\\nSo far, 204 minors in Office of Refugee Resettlement custody, as well as 745 staff and contractors, have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to Sualog\\'s declaration.\\nICE official Russell Hott made a similar warning, saying the transfer of more migrants to the agency\\'s three family detention centers in Texas and Pennsylvania would make it more challenging to implement coronavirus containment measures.\\nToczylowski, the immigration attorney who has worked with migrant children processed under the CDC order, strongly rejected the government\\'s arguments. She said other measures could be taken to contain the coronavirus, including conducting rapid testing on migrant children and families before releasing them to sponsors so they can quarantine and continue their immigration proceedings outside of detention. \\n\"It\\'s laughable that the only option is to hold children in hotel rooms before expelling them and to say that it stops the spread of coronavirus,\" she added.\\n'},\n",

The confirmation of the previously undisclosed policy shift follows a court declaration, signed on September 17, in which ICE official Mellissa Harper said the number of migrant minors who were awaiting expulsion at a hotel had dwindled to zero.\\nDespite this shift, unaccompanied children and families with minors who cross or arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border without documents — just like single adults — can still be expelled from the country under a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) directive issued in March, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokesperson Matthew Dyman told CBS News on Thursday.\\n\"The CDC order allows for everyone to be amenable to expulsion,\" Dyman said. \"Anyone can be infected with COVID.\"\\nICE quietly stopped holding migrant children in border hotels on Sept. 11.\\nBut CBP says unaccompanied minors and families with children can still be expelled from the US, without an opportunity to seek asylum, under COVID restrictions. @CBSNews. 1/https://t.co/v5z8z2zCpt\\nTaylor Levy, an independent immigration attorney in El Paso, said she continues to receive cases of unaccompanied children whom border officials seek to expel.

ICE did not provide an explanation or say whether it would resume its use of hotels, saying in a statement it could not provide further comment due to ongoing litigation.\\n\"Any temporary housing of minors will comply with all legal requirements,\" an ICE spokesperson said.\\nOn September 4, Judge Dolly Gee of the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles ordered the Trump administration to stop holding migrant children in hotels, absent limited three-day stays, finding that the makeshift detention system violated the Flores Settlement Agreement, which stipulates that undocumented minors in U.S. custody need to have access to lawyers, safe and sanitary facilities and other safeguards while the government seeks their prompt release.\\nBut that ruling is not in effect due to several orders by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has placed an administrative stay on Gee\\'s mandate. On Wednesday, a three-member panel of 9th Circuit judges extended the stay to next Monday.\\nDuring a hearing Wednesday, Judge Marsha Berzon, one of the members of the 9th Circuit panel, asked Scott Stewart, the Justice Department lawyer representing the government, whether immigration officials had stopped placing children in border hotels.\\n\"My understanding is that that\\'s the situation at the time, your honor. I don\\'t know all the reasons for that,\" Stewart responded. \"But, again, I would emphasize that time in hotels is meant to be very quick.\"\\n\"We\\'ve been in this kind of odd limbo for some period of time with administrative stays, your honor, where the agencies are gearing up to, you know, maybe they\\'re going to need to comply all the sudden, maybe not, so ... they\\'ve taken some caution,\" Stewart added.\\nAfter Berzon said \"I have no idea what you just said\" and asked Stewart whether the government was complying with an order it was not bound to, the Justice Department lawyer responded: \"No, your honor, what I\\'m saying is that, you know, it\\'s hard to gear up and close down this operation. And I think they keep seeing they\\'re on the eve of the order taking effect multiple times in recent weeks, so ... I think there\\'s been some difficulty with going full speed ahead.\"\\nSince March, U.S. authorities along the southern border have carried out more than 159,000 expulsions — including of 8,800 unaccompanied children — under the CDC order, which the administration says is designed to prevent potentially infected migrants from spreading the coronavirus inside the country. While most single adults have been expelled directly to Mexico, hundreds of unaccompanied children and families with minors were held in hotels prior to their expulsion from the U.S.\\nLawyers and advocates have denounced the hotel detention system as secretive, saying children were essentially held isolated before being summarily expelled from the U.S. without the opportunity to seek asylum.\\nThe administration has used the CDC order to circumvent certain legal safeguards for migrant children, including a 2008 anti-trafficking law that requires border officials to transfer non-Mexican unaccompanied minors to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which holds them in shelters until they are released to sponsors.\\nBetween April and July, the refugee agency received 330 migrant children, even as border officials recorded more than 5,900 apprehensions of unaccompanied minors during the same time span. The population of children in the agency\\'s care dropped to approximately 800 in late July, a more than a decade low.\\nBut the number of children being transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement has increased significantly in recent weeks. Border officials made 423 referrals in August, when more than 3,000 arrests of unaccompanied minors were recorded, according to data obtained by CBS News.\\nDuring the first three weeks of September, the refugee agency received 568 migrant children, according to court documents. While it received zero referrals on several spring and summer days, in one September day, the agency received 32 children. At the end of September, 1,680\\xa0minors were in Office of Refugee Resettlement custody, according to agency statistics provided on Friday.\\nTrump administration officials have said Gee\\'s order, if implemented, would overburden ICE family detention centers and U.S. refugee agency shelters and hinder efforts to contain the coronavirus inside these facilities. In a court declaration, Office of Refugee Resettlement deputy director Jallyn Sualog said two of the newly admitted children tested positive for coronavirus, while 170 were in quarantine after her agency determined they had been exposed to the virus.\\nAdvocates, however, have said the refugee agency can safely take in migrant children, noting that it has approximately 13,000 empty beds.\\nNeha Desai, one of the attorneys in the Flores settlement case and the director of the immigration division at the National Center for Youth Law, said that while hotel detention of children has temporarily ceased, the administration\\'s policies and court requests still raise concerns. \\xa0\\n\"Simply because they were no children in hotels at a specific point in time, does not mean that the government has abandoned their use of hotels,\" Desai told CBS News. \"In fact, they are vigorously litigating to ensure that they have continued ability to detain children in unlicensed facilities, including hotels. Moreover, the government continues to demonstrate a reckless, disregard for the lives of vulnerable children as they continue to summarily expel these children.\"\\nWhile they extended their stay of Gee\\'s order, the panel of 9th Circuit judges on Wednesday expressed skepticism over the administration\\'s argument that children it wants to expel under the CDC order are not entitled to Flores agreement safeguards.\\nIn one exchange, Judge William Fletcher pressed Stewart, the government attorney, on why immigration officials could not provide children in hotels access to attorneys, highlighting a declaration that said a detained minor was instructed not to tell her mother where she was.\\n\"Sometimes, you know, letting people have lawyers, even if you\\'re not obliged to, might be a good idea. I mean this strikes me almost as a scofflaw, when there\\'s a plausible argument — in fact I think it\\'s an argument you may be about to lose — as to whether or not the Flores Agreement applies, and the government says, \\'well, we don\\'t think it applies, so you don\\'t get a lawyer,\\'\" Fletcher said.\\nStewart said Fletcher was relying on a \"number of hearsay statements\" and reiterated that hotel detention is designed to be \"short-term.\"\\n\"I might have something better than what I have on the record if you allowed access,\" Fletcher countered.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'The Departments of Labor and Homeland Security on Tuesday unveiled new restrictions to H-1B work visas as part of the Trump administration\\'s long-sought objective of overhauling a guest worker program it says allows U.S. companies to replace American job-seekers with foreign workers who they can pay lower wages.\\nUnder the Department of Labor rule, employers will need to pay H-1B holders higher wages, a move Trump administration officials said will discourage U.S. companies from turning to cheaper labor from abroad. \\nThe DHS rule will redefine the \"specialty occupations\" H-1B visa holders can qualify for, requiring petitioners to prove they have a college degree in the specific field they are seeking to work in. The changes will also expand compliance enforcement and mandate that workers hired through a third-party firm be granted one-year work authorizations, instead of the current three-year period.\\nThe Department of Labor interim final rule will take effect Thursday, while the DHS companion rule is expected to be enforced in two months. Collectively, the rules represent the broadest overhaul of the H-1B program in decades, according to experts and government officials. \\nKen Cuccinelli, the second-in-command at DHS, said the changes will affect \"over one-third\" of all H-1B visa petitioners.\\n\"We\\'re making good on President Trump\\'s promise that he made to the American people nearly four years ago, to restore the integrity to the immigration system, to protect Americans from those who seek to exploit our system for personal gain, and to never forget each and every hard-working American struggling to provide for his or her family,\" Cuccinelli said in a call with reporters. \"This rule will help us rebuild our economy and put Americans back to work.\"\\nH-1B visas, which are designed for professionals seeking to work in fields deemed to be high-skilled, are popular in the technology sector, including among Silicon Valley companies. At the start of each fiscal year, 85,000 H-1B visas are awarded through a lottery system. Historically, many of the applicants have hailed from India.\\nThe Trump administration and the groups that support its immigration policies have long criticized guest workers programs, including H-1B visas, arguing that they are fraught with abuse and hurt U.S. workers. Since the early days of President Trump\\'s tenure, making major changes to the program has been an objective in the administration\\'s broader agenda to limit legal immigration.\\nIn June, citing the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Trump signed a proclamation stopping the issuance of temporary work visas, including for the H-1B program, until the end of the year. That ban was partially blocked last week by a federal judge in San Francisco.\\nPatrick Pizzella, the deputy secretary of labor, called the changes announced on Tuesday \"long overdue,\" but said they\\'ve become \"imperative\" given the coronavirus recession.\\n\"It is never acceptable for the employment of foreign labor to erode the economic security of American workers and their families,\" Pizzella told reporters. \"With millions of Americans looking for work as the economy continues its recovery, immediate action is needed to guard against the risk lower-cost foreign labor can pose to the well-being of U.S. workers.\"\\nSarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute, said the rules unveiled on Tuesday, especially the shortened visas for workers hired through third-party consulting firms, are too draconian, and predicted that they will hurt visa holders, their employers and companies that benefit from their work. \\n\"There are many problems with the H-1B program, including that there are instances where H-1B workers are replacing U.S. workers. And that\\'s a problem that needs to be dealt with,\" she said. \"But the Trump administration is dealing with it by punishing all H-1B workers, and especially those that are working in third-party worksites.\"\\nPierce said a better approach to address the H-1B program\\'s flaws is to impose a requirement that third-party firms prove that visa holders will not be replacing U.S. workers. \\n\"There is a way to thread this needle to address the problem that they\\'re concerned with, but instead they are just hitting it with a sledgehammer,\" she said.\\n'},\n",

Mr. Trump slashed refugee spots to 45,000 in fiscal year 2018; to 30,000 in fiscal year 2019; and to 18,000 in fiscal year 2020.\\nBecause of a temporary admissions freeze during the first months of the pandemic, the U.S. admitted roughly 11,000 refugees in fiscal year 2020, another record low, according to State Department data.\\nAt the end of last year, there were nearly 80 million people — including more than 30 million children — who had been forcibly displaced from their homes around the world, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\\n\"We have known all along, and this administration has demonstrated their deep hostility to refugees. And so this fiscal year is just the latest dramatic example of the downward spiral,\" Barbara Strack, who led the refugee affairs division at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services until her retirement in 2018, told CBS News.\\nThe State Department said the 15,000 spots for the next 12 months will be reserved for those fleeing religious persecution, Iraqis who assisted U.S. forces and refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Cuba and Venezuela.  \\xa0\\nBarring some exceptions, no new refugees can be admitted in the next 12 months until Mr. Trump signs his formal annual determination, which is supposed to occur after a consultation with Congress under the Refugee Act of 1980. That consultation has yet to occur, angering Democratic lawmakers.\\nAccording to U.S. resettlement groups and Democratic Representatives Jerrold Nadler and Zoe Lofgren, the Trump administration has placed a moratorium on refugee admissions through October 26.\\nIf he wins, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has vowed to take in 125,000 refugees during his first year in office — a goal experts say is lofty, given the toll the ceiling cuts have had on the U.S. resettlement infrastructure.\\nIn its statement on Wednesday, the State Department said the U.S. government expects to receive 290,000 asylum applications in the next 12 months. But it failed to note that not all applicants are ultimately granted asylum, another humanitarian protection the administration has severely restricted, especially for migrants who cross the southern border.\\nThe State Department also said it is employing diplomacy and allocating billions of dollars to prevent and address crises around the world that are prompting people to flee their homes, highlighting a $9 billion humanitarian aid package distributed in fiscal year 2019. \"We are working to assist refugees and other displaced people as close to their homes as possible until they can safely and voluntarily return to rebuild their lives, their communities, and their countries,\" the department added.\\nMr. Trump and some of his advisers have repeatedly criticized the refugee program, portraying refugees as economic and cultural burdens to U.S. communities and arguing that some could pose a risk to national security. The president has, on numerous occasions, referenced refugees while campaigning to galvanize his supporters, telling them at a rally in Minnesota on Wednesday that Biden would \"inundate\" their state with a \"historic flood of refugees.\"\\n\"It\\'s such a tragedy to see refugees used as political pawns,\" Krish O\\'Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, a resettlement office, told CBS News. \"This program has always had bipartisan support.

Biden will mark Hispanic Heritage Month in an event in Kissimmee on Tuesday evening.\\n\"I will talk about how I am going to work like the devil to make sure I turn every Latino and Hispanic vote,\" Biden told reporters on Monday about his plans for his trip to Florida.\\nThe former vice president also said that his overall support among Latino voters is \"much higher\" than support for Mr. Trump, but he acknowledged \"they\\'ve got to go higher.\"\\nAlthough Biden could still win the White House without Florida, the state is considered a linchpin for President Trump, who won its 29 electoral votes in 2016. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has committed to spending $100 million in the state to aid Biden.\\nHowever, Biden\\'s support appears to be slipping among Latino voters, who make up roughly 26% of the state\\'s population. An NBC News/Marist College poll released earlier this month showed Biden lagging behind Mr. Trump among likely Latino voters, receiving 46% support from likely Latino voters compared to 50% support for Mr. Trump. Exit polls from 2016 showed that the majority of Latinos in the state backed Hillary Clinton, although Cubans were about twice as likely to support Mr. Trump as non-Cuban Latinos.\\nAlthough Biden may have an uphill battle to attract Cuban voters, he has sought to strengthen his support among Puerto Rican voters, who also make up a significant portion of the population in Florida. Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny allowed the Biden campaign to use his music in an ad which is airing in Pennsylvania and Florida. Biden has also harshly criticized Mr. Trump\\'s response to Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017.\\nOthers have questioned whether the Biden campaign is doing enough to reach out to the Latino community. Chuck Rocha, a former senior adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders\\' presidential campaigns, told CBSN on Monday that Biden was lagging among Latino voters in part because of \"a lack of money\" from his campaign on Latino outreach.\\n\"The fact of the matter is there\\'s just not money going to take that message to Latinos as there needs to be,\" Rocha said.\\nJavier Fernandez, a Democrat running for the state Senate in Miami-Dade County, told CBS Miami\\xa0that there did not seem to be much enthusiasm for Biden among Latino voters in Florida.\\n\"I don\\'t know that they\\'re super excited about Joe Biden,\" Fernandez said.\\nMr. Trump has also been working to appeal to Latino voters in recent weeks. He participated in a Latinos for Trump roundtable in Phoenix on Monday.\\nAlthough some Latino voters are wary of Mr. Trump because of his anti-immigration policies, Biden has also faced criticism because of the high number of deportations implemented by the Obama administration. Biden has said that he regrets the deportations of migrants without criminal records under President Obama.\\nBiden also attended an event with veterans in Tampa on Tuesday. Biden, whose son served in the military, slammed Mr. Trump\\'s \"degradation of service members.\" A poll by Monmouth University released on Tuesday found that Mr. Trump leads Biden by just four percentage points in military households in Florida.

       "  'body': 'Remote education for kids at home versus in-person teaching at school isn\\'t just inconvenient for many parents, it could cost them their jobs if they can\\'t nail down affordable childcare.\\xa0\\nResearch from hedge fund Brevan Howard found that more than 4 million U.S. workers who can\\'t do their jobs from home could end up having to leave the workforce this fall, the Wall Street Journal\\xa0recently reported. The firm calculated that 5.3 million parents have jobs that require their physical presence and children under the age of 14, too young to be left at home on their own.\\nResearchers also estimated that 81% of children will be educated remotely this fall, based on the 100 largest school districts\\' reopening plans, according to the report. That suggests 4.3 million workers could have to quit their jobs unless they can come up with a suitable alternative to childcare.\\nA spokesperson for the hedge fund declined to comment on the research.\\xa0\\nOf course, quitting their jobs is the last thing most people should do. Labor economist Teresa Ghilarducci cautions parents against leaving the workforce prematurely\\xa0unless absolutely necessary. Her advice is backed up by data showing that, for women in particular, taking even a short break from work comes with hidden, longer-term costs.\\xa0\\n\"In the short term it looks good, but in the long term it may turn out to be the wrong thing to do. What I am trying to do is prevent regret,\" Ghilarducci told CBS MoneyWatch.\\xa0\\nTake a 30-year old parent who earns $50,000 a year and opts to take a year off from work. That single year on the sidelines adds up to a loss of more than $156,000 in lifetime pay, Ghilarducci said, including a reduction in retirement benefits and wage growth, according to a\\xa0calculator from the Center For American Progress.\\n\"Based on what has happened in the past, it\\'s women who are more likely to drop out in September to take care of their kids, rather than fathers,\" she said.\\xa0\\nCheasty Anderson, director of immigration policy and advocacy for the Children\\'s Defense Fund-Texas, is among the working parents who are all too aware that their kids\\' school schedules could conflict with their careers. She has already had to cut back on her work hours to help guide her daughters, ages 6 and 7, through five days a week of\\xa0online school.\\nAnd Anderson is among the lucky ones. She can\\xa0work from home, and her employer provides working parents with generous paid time off. \"I don\\'t want to quit, and so far my organization has made it possible for me not to quit. But if they had not done that, I would have had to leave,\" she said.\\xa0\\nRenée Divine is another working mother who finds herself juggling running her own business –– a sex therapy practice in Minneapolis, Minnesota –– and taking care of her daughter, who is in second grade.\\xa0\\n\"I am supporting a ton of families right now who are obviously encountering the same thing my husband and I are, having started school last week under a hybrid model, and we are really seeing how difficult it is to have a second-grader at home,\" she said.\\xa0\\nDivine has already scaled back on the number of individual therapy sessions she\\'s holding and is instead conducting more group workshops in order to maximize her reach. The workshops are in person, outdoors. Less certain is what she would do if there were a coronavirus outbreak at her daughter\\'s school and her daughter were sent home to learn remotely five days a week.\\xa0\\n\"If they end up going full distance learning, I will not be able to function in my work the way I have been.

       "  'body': 'Twitter announced Tuesday that it\\'s launching a \"2020 U.S. election hub\" that will promote accurate information and resources for voters, with\\xa0less than 50 days to go before the general election.\\nThe hub will be featured at the top of U.S. users\\' Explore tab, and will include \"news in both English and Spanish in the form of Twitter Moments created by reputable news outlets themselves, or by Twitter\\'s Curation team,\" a press release from the company said. The hub will also feature live streams of major election events like debates, includes a tool that shows candidates for congressional and gubernatorial races, and will have localized news and resources by state.\\nNine in 10 daily Twitter users say they plan to vote in the upcoming elections, but over half say they still need more information about the candidates on their ballot and how to vote in 2020, according to an August study conducted by Twitter and Ipsos, a market research company.\\nTwitter, acknowledging it\\'s already a hub for political conversation, resources and breaking news, said it wants users to be able to access reputable information with ease, so they\\'re able to \"meet registration deadlines and participate confidently.\"\\n\"Twitter wants to empower every eligible person to vote in the 2020 US election, and we\\'re focused on helping people register, better understand the voting process during COVID-19 including early voting options, and feel informed about the choices on their ballot,\" read the press release. \\xa0\\nThe election hub will also include \"voter education public service announcements\" running through Election Day, according to the social media company. The PSAs were produced with information from non-partisan government and voting advocacy organizations, Twitter said, and will provide information on voter registration, request an absentee ballot, and offer advice on \"staying healthy while voting during the pandemic.\" The first PSA is already live in\\xa0English\\xa0and\\xa0Spanish.\\nTwitter, Facebook and other social media companies faced some controversy in 2016 after it emerged that the Russian government had engaged in an interference campaign intent on sowing confusion about the election and undermining Hillary Clinton\\'s presidential candidacy. Russia\\'s social media influence campaigns tried to exploit divisive political issues like race, gun control and religion. After the 2016 election, Oxford University researchers\\xa0estimated\\xa0that 126 million Facebook users and 20 million Instagram users had been reached by such content.\\nIn November, Twitter banned all political advertisements across its social media platform. At the time, in\\xa0announcing the shift, founder and CEO Jack Dorsey said that \"a political message reach should be earned, not bought.\"\\nThe company defines a political ad as one that refers to an election or candidate, or that advocates for or against \"legislative issues of national importance,\" like climate change, health care, immigration or taxes, Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde\\xa0said\\xa0at the time. \\nThe decision stood in sharp contrast with rival Facebook, which came under fire for its decision to allow lies in political ads. Facebook head Mark Zuckerberg later\\xa0defended that policy, saying that banning such ads would be akin to censorship.\\n\"In a democracy, I don\\'t think it\\'s right for private companies to censor politicians and the news,\" Zuckerberg then said in a call with investors less than an hour after Twitter announced its policy.\\nIn another departure from Facebook, Twitter began flagging inaccurate tweets from President Trump this year. The company added its\\xa0first fact-checking label to a Trump tweet in May, and has since labeled several tweets from Mr. Trump as inaccurate. Twitter also flagged the president\\'s tweet stating, \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" in response to protests over the death of George Floyd, for \"glorifying violence.\"\\nFacebook introduced\\xa0its own set of steps to battle misinformation this month, backtracking on its previous stance. The\\xa0social media giant\\xa0said it will now, among other things, remove posts with \"clear misinformation\" about the coronavirus pandemic and voting, attaching a link to authoritative information on both instead.\\xa0\\nPresident Trump has repeatedly tried to discredit mail-in voting, and recently\\xa0encouraged supporters in North Carolina to vote twice, once by mail and once in person — which is illegal — in order to \"test\" mail-in voting systems. Twitter has added a fact-checking label to two of Mr. Trump\\'s false tweets about\\xa0mail-in ballots.\\nZuckerberg told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King earlier this month that Facebook\\'s flagging of misinformation about mail-in voting also\\xa0applies to the president. In addition, Facebook said it is not accepting new political ads the week before the election and will add a label directing users to official election results in the event that a candidate tries to\\xa0declare victory before final results are in.\\n\"I think it\\'s important that we start preparing people now,\" Zuckerberg said. \"There\\'s nothing illegitimate about taking a few extra days, or even weeks, in order to make sure that all the votes get counted. In fact, it would be illegitimate if we didn\\'t make sure that all of the valid votes were counted.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'The Department of Homeland Security has concluded its first-ever \"Homeland Threat Assessment,\" a comprehensive report designed to educate the public on the largest threats facing the country. The report, first obtained by CBS News, highlights major threats posed by China and Russia and identifies white supremacists as posing the \"most persistent and lethal threat\" of all domestic violent extremist groups.\\xa0\\nIn an exclusive interview, acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf said the report \"touches on all the major threat streams that I look at on a daily basis.\"\\xa0\\nIn September, a senior DHS official alleged in a whistleblower complaint that Wolf told him to withhold an intelligence notification on Russian activities because it \"made the president look bad,\" and claimed senior Trump administration officials urged analysts to downplay the threat of violent white supremacy. But Wolf told CBS News on Monday that the Homeland Threat Assessment was free from political influence.\\xa0\\n\"I am obviously aware of those complaints,\" he said. \"I think if you look at the document, Russia is mentioned somewhere in the document between 30 and 40 different times, so if we were trying to downplay Russia, we didn\\'t do a very good job, I would say.\\xa0 The threat is specifically called out there when we talk about election, potential election interference, or disinformation… We are very upfront.\"\\nThese are the major takeaways from the report. \\xa0\\nThe report cited multiple potential threats from China, warning the country \"already poses a high cyber espionage threat to the Homeland and Beijing\\'s cyber-attack capabilities will grow.\"\\xa0\\nIt also said China has been a \"particularly persistent\" source of counterfeit medical supplies during the coronavirus pandemic, claiming that more than 1 million FDA-prohibited COVID-19 test kits and 75,000 counterfeit masks have been seized from illicit Chinese manufacturers. The report warned that Beijing has been monitoring shortages in U.S. medical supply chains, and said China could exploit those shortages to force the government to adopt more pro-China policies.\\xa0\\nWolf told CBS News that he believes \"the most long term strategic threat to Americans to the Homeland and really to our way of life would be the threat from China.\"\\xa0\\n\"It cuts across a variety of different threats, from the cyber threats we see, from foreign influence, to supply chain security, to exploiting our academic and visa systems, foreign investment here in the U.S., trade policy violations and the like. It goes on and on and on…\" he said. \"Just across the board, threat after threat stream, we see China playing a very significant and enhanced role trying to really do the U.S. some long-term harm.\"\\nThe report also highlighted Russia\\'s efforts to influence the 2020 U.S. Presidential election by exacerbating existing social and political tensions in an effort to \"sway U.S. voter perceptions.\"\\xa0\\nThe report did not indicate a preference by Russia for a specific candidate, but did note an effort to undermine the campaign of Joe Biden: \"Russia uses divisive measures to disrupt the electoral process — including denigrating former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia \\'establishment\\' — as part of a broader effort to divide and destabilize America,\" the report says.\\nWolf told CBS News that despite foreign attempts to influence the election, he does not believe that any election infrastructure has been compromised.\\xa0\\n\"What we know right now is that none of those nation states are targeting election infrastructure, at least haven\\'t done so successfully,\" he said. \"That is different than what we saw in 2016 at this time, leading up to the election.\"\\nThe report also highlighted Russia\\'s skill in cyber espionage and cyber attacks, warning that the nation likely has the ability to conduct attacks that would last hours to days, and is developing the capability to conduct \"more debilitating\" attacks. \\xa0\\nThe report found that the most likely terrorist threat to the United States comes from \"ideologically motivated lone offenders and small groups,\" with domestic violent extremists posing the \"primary terrorist threat\" inside the U.S. Of the domestic violent extremists, the report said, \"racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists—specifically white supremacist extremists (WSEs)—will remain the most persistent and lethal threat.\"\\xa0\\nWhite supremacist groups have killed more people than any other domestic violent extremist group, according to the report. But Wolf told CBS News that the report is \"also very clear to call out anarchist threats.\" \\xa0\\n\"..if you are only looking at deaths, and you are not looking at property damage, insurance claims and all the other societal factors, and only looking at deaths, then yes, white supremacist extremists sort of lead that category,\" Wolf said. \"But as we have witnessed over the last several months, the movements and the civil unrest we have seen here inside the U.S., while maybe not lethal, certainly have lasting implications to the homeland and do serve as a threat to the homeland.\"\\xa0\\xa0The report said that \"DHS law enforcement officers suffered over 300 separate injuries and\\xa0 were assaulted with sledgehammers,\\xa0 commercial grade fireworks, rocks, metal pipes, improvised explosive devices, and more\" as part of violence perpetrated by \"anarchist extremists.\"\\nThe report touched on a number of other threats, including Iran and North Korea. While the report stressed that the cyber capabilities of both nations were weaker than those of China and Russia, it nevertheless warned that the nations could develop the ability to conduct disruptive attacks.\\xa0\\nWhile the report said that U.S. counterterrorism efforts have reduced the likelihood of a foreign terrorist attack on U.S. soil, it warned that terrorist groups \"can adapt quickly and resurge,\" and said Iran \"will continue to develop and maintain terrorist capabilities\" to deter the U.S. from \"regime-threatening actions\" or to retaliate for such activity.\\xa0 The report made clear that the founding principal of combatting terrorism \"will always be a priority to the Department of Homeland Security.\"\\nThe report also cited illegal immigration, noting that while the vast majority of migrants do not pose a security risk, \"pathways used by migrants to travel to the United States have been exploited by threat actors.\"\\xa0\\nThe report concluded by noting the record-breaking hurricane and wildfire seasons that have caused billions of dollars in damage this year. While the report cited active land management as a potential solution for the wildfires, it did not mention climate change in either section\\xa0 — despite the fact that experts have linked the intensity of the hurricane and wildfire seasons to global warming.\\xa0\\nDHS Homeland Threat Assessment by News Team\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'The term \"crisis on the border\" typically refers to immigration issues or drugs being smuggled into the country. But it has one more meaning, as we discovered when we travelled to the border in early February: tens of millions of gallons of raw sewage that spill every year into the Tijuana River on the Mexican Side and flow across the border right into Southern California, polluting the land, air, and sea.\\nMexico and the United States each thinks the other side should be doing more to clean it up, with no effective solution found on either side of the border for decades.\\nThis is where the Tijuana River crosses the border into the United States. This cement structure was built to contain flooding from rainfall. But this isn\\'t just rain water, it\\'s a toxic mix of raw sewage from neighboring Tijuana, draining into Southern California on lower ground, eventually emptying into the pacific ocean.\\xa0\\nAmber Craig: So, it effectively-- it\\'s like a toilet flushing straight into this river valley.\\xa0\\nBorder Patrol agent Amber Craig took us on a tour of the sewage infiltration, showing us that what doesn\\'t flush out to sea, washes up on land. Mountains of plastic bottles, furniture and tires.\\xa0\\nAmber Craig: And this is a concern for us, too, not just because it\\'s debris and waste, but because the mosquitoes love to nest in it, so...\\xa0\\nIt\\'s a health concern, an eyesore, and it\\'s hindering the Border Patrol\\'s main mission. She took us to see President Trump\\'s newly erected wall along the border: just this six-mile stretch cost an estimated $50 million.\\xa0\\nWhat we found is that under the wall, there\\'s a network of basins and tunnels built 30 years ago to try to capture the sewage from Tijuana. The red dot is me, next to agent Amber Craig, inside one of those concrete sewage collection basins. It\\'s connected on either end to tunnels from Mexico to California that were constructed right under the wall.\\nLesley Stahl: So you think of the smugglers and the migrants building tunnels to go under the wall. But the U.S. government built this tunnel that goes under the wall.\\nAmber Craig: Yes, we built this so that the water would flow freely into the United States.\\nIt has to flow freely because four decades ago the U.S. signed an agreement with Mexico not to cause backup flooding at this area of the border. These metal grates at the ends of the tunnel let the water in while keeping the rubbish out. It typically works fine during dry weather, but not when it storms.\\nAmber Craig: The amount of water that comes through here comes through like a torrent. It is very, very dangerous. It is a raging river when it rains.\\nLesley Stahl: With the tires and the barrels and everything--\\nAmber Craig: Full of debris and garbage. That\\'s correct. It\\'s very dangerous.\\nThe debris and garbage can hurtle down here with such force that Border Patrol agents have to open the grates to prevent the system from clogging. That means trash flows into California unobstructed. It\\'s also an opening for migrants.\\nLesley Stahl: The purpose of the wall is being totally defeated by this obligation of yours to lift the grates.\\nAmber Craig: You-- well, yup. It does make it a little more challenging to have to have that open. Of course, we don\\'t want to have it open.\\nLesley Stahl: If they go through that tunnel, they\\'re in the United States.\\nAmber Craig: If the grates have to be opened, then we have to have a personnel, an agent, on the other side, keeping--\\nLesley Stahl: So as they come out.\\nAmber Craig: That\\'s correct.\\nLesley Stahl: How do the smugglers know that the grates are lifted?\\nAmber Craig: They watch.\\xa0Lesley Stahl: They watch?\\nAmber Craig: Sure. There\\'re smugglers watching us probably right now.\\nMigrants are routinely caught risking their lives crossing in the sewage: some need to be rescued and decontaminated.\\nLesley Stahl: Let me read you a list that we found of stuff that is in this water: fecal coliforms, drug-resistant bacteria, benzene, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chromium medical waste, and DDT, which has been banned for years in the United States.\\nAmber Craig: Yes, ma\\'am.\\xa0\\nLesley Stahl: I hear that sometimes the water turns funny colors?\\nAmber Craig: It does. We\\'ve had bright, bright purple, a bright pink, neon green, dark black.\\nLesley Stahl: So the migrants are going into this?\\nAmber Craig: Yes, ma\\'am.\\nLesley Stahl: And the patrol agents are going into this. Are they getting sick?\\nAmber Craig: Agents have reported various health injuries. Rashes are very common. Stomach issues. We\\'ve had one agent who had a flesh-eating bacteria. And he almost lost his arm.\\nLesley Stahl: How angry are you and the other agents?\\nAmber Craig: We\\'re frustrated, very frustrated. Agents know our job is dangerous. We\\'ve signed up for a job where we could be shot at, where we could die in a car accident. And we accept that. Nobody thought that they were gonna come here and be exposed to this, to the sewage, and the chemicals and the smell.\\nCongress just allocated $300 million to address the sewage issue all along the border, a fraction of what\\'s needed. Especially here, because of the rapidly growing population of Tijuana.\\xa0Amber Craig: It is a difficult situation. We\\'re having to deal with another country. And the City of Tijuana,\\xa0 it\\'s just a huge city, it\\'s overpopulated. Their infrastructure isn\\'t-- isn\\'t prepared to handle this kind of flow. So it just comes right over the border.\\nThe local Mexican sewage authority invited us to one of the main treatment pumps in Tijuana. It often breaks down due to mechanical failures. So workers have to wade underground in black sludge to repair the buckling facility. While we were there, one worker got so overwhelmed by toxic fumes he required medical attention.\\xa0\\nAccording to the Mexican authority, the last line of defense keeping the sewage out of the U.S. here is a small crew of sanitation workers who unclog drains by hand along the border. We found one of them, a man named Abel, clearing trash with a rake.\\xa0\\nSome of the wastewater that does get collected is pumped into these giant pools six miles south of the border, where the sewage is supposed to be treated and discharged through this massive pipe as clean water into the ocean. But the facility hasn\\'t worked for years, so what you\\'re looking at is untreated sewage emptying directly into the Pacific.\\nWe stood by the torrent with Fay Crevoshay, an environmentalist with Wild Coast, a watchdog group of concerned citizens from both sides of the border.\\nLesley Stahl: How much sewage are we talking about?\\nFay Crevoshay: Yeah. The local authorities say that it\\'s 25 million gallons a day. We think it\\'s 40 million gallons.\\nLesley Stahl: And it\\'s just gushing, gushing, gushing out.\\nFay Crevoshay: That\\'s what we have here.\\nMaking matters worse, entire shantytowns have popped up in Tijuana\\'s canyons along the border. Many of these makeshift shacks were thrown-up by people who moved here for jobs, at factories created by the North American Free Trade Agreement.\\nLesley Stahl: These factories are dumping their chemicals?\\nFay Crevoshay: Sure. We have laws, but there is no--\\nLesley Stahl: Enforcement--\\nFay Crevoshay: --control. So why spend money? The problem is these factories come here because it\\'s cheap. They\\'re gonna pay the workers $8 a day. And this is the result. This is where the workers live. These houses have no services, no electricity--\\nLesley Stahl: No plumbing.\\nFay Crevoshay: --no plumbing, nothing.\\nLesley Stahl: This stream, this entire stream, is just raw sewage.\\nFay Crevoshay: Sewage.\\nLesley Stahl: When it rains, what happens to this stream?\\nFay Crevoshay: It grows. They have a whole river! You see all the lying garbage, all around it?\\nLesley Stahl: Yeah. That--\\nFay Crevoshay: It takes it with!\\n\\xa0We saw tires everywhere, a lot of them from California that were sold to Mexican car-owners second-hand. When the tires wear out, many are used to prop up homes on the hillside or just get dumped and then get swept by the sewage right back to Southern California.\\xa0\\nWe wondered where all the untreated sewage that emptied into the ocean goes. Well, we learned that it can flow right by a U.S. military training base. Hard to believe but the Navy SEALs are training right in the path of the sludge.\\nLesley Stahl: Let me ask the SEALs, how many of you-- have gone swimming in that?\\nALL: All of us.\\nRetired naval officer Mark West and four retired SEALs - Alex Lopez, Kyle Buckett, Bill Lyman, and Steve Viola - told us how the sewage impacts those training here.\\nSteve Viola: It wreaks havoc on your system. Stomach aches, throwing up, I mean, coming out both ends—fever. And you just have to suck it up and keep going.\\nKyle Buckett: We\\'ve had classes of, you know, 38 to 42 guys contract it during their training cycle. And it\\'s a very, it\\'s a big challenge for us to deal with that.\\nAlex Lopez: I contracted cellulitis. Which is--\\nLesley Stahl: What\\'s that?\\nAlex Lopez: --a bacterial, like, staph infection. It just took off, and it started eating, you know, flesh on both my legs.\\xa0\\nThey say that the most vulnerable are SEAL BUD/S, those trying out to be SEALs, especially during \"Hell Week\" –five and a half days immersed in the ocean, testing their endurance.\\nLesley Stahl: Have you heard that during Hell Week the BUD/S now take prophylactic antibiotics?\\nSteve Viola: Yes, I have heard that.\\nLesley Stahl: You were a trainer. Do you ever say, \"These kids can\\'t go in this today. I can smell it, I can see it.\"\\nKyle Buckett: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, we have.\\nLesley Stahl: You do-- you do.\\nKyle Buckett: We have, we have. And then we have to transition to the bay or to a pool.\\xa0\\nBill Lyman: There\\'s no waves in the bay and there\\'s no waves in the pool.\\nLesley Stahl: Are you seeing any reason for us to worry about your readiness?\\nMark West: I think, I think that our readiness is being impacted. And you know--\\nLesley Stahl: It is being im--\\nMark West: Yeah, it is. \\xa0\\xa0\\nThe SEALs say the Navy, aware of the sewage issue, is monitoring the water quality. So we found it odd that it is spending a billion dollars to expand the SEALs\\' training base much closer to the source of the pollution.\\xa0\\nSteve Viola: Well we had outgrown the capacity of the buildings that we had. So that\\'s why we moved down there.\\nLesley Stahl: But were they taking the pollution into account?\\nBill Lyman: No\\nLesley Stahl: The Navy did do an environmental impact study.\\xa0\\nGROUP: Yes.\\nKyle Buckett: The Navy\\'s main focus was to see how much we were gonna impact the environment. It wasn\\'t focused on what the environment was gonna impact on the Navy SEAL community.\\nThe Navy turned down our request for an interview, but recently told Congress in a report that the run-off is a concern, yet its impact has been \"infrequent and short term,\" concluding that it is easily mitigated. Serge Dedina, mayor of Imperial Beach, the city on the south-edge of the new base, doesn\\'t buy it.\\xa0\\nSerge Dedina: They\\'ve ignored the health and safety of their own national security staff, and that\\'s absolutely unacceptable.\\nLesley Stahl: Did you ever get any health problems from the water?\\nSerge Dedina: Yeah. I have a tube in my ear \\'cause I had so many ear infections. My kids have gotten sick. Our lifeguards have gotten sick. Pretty much every one of our councilmembers have gotten sick. So it\\'s-- it\\'s devastated our city.\\xa0\\nIn more ways than one. Imperial Beach is a surfing town, but its beaches are closed a third of the year or more due to the toxic sludge.\\xa0\\nSerge Dedina: I\\'ve got to spend my time hammering people in power to make sure they understand that dumping toxic waste on Navy SEALs and Border Patrol agents is a bad idea, and getting them to acknowledge that it\\'s actually happening.\\nLesley Stahl: If the Navy weighed in do you think things would begin to happen?\\nSerge Dedina: I think if the Navy brass weighed in, this would be fixed tomorrow. \\xa0\\nMeanwhile, the Niagara of sewage keeps gushing, the grates keep opening, and Abel keeps at it with his rake.\\nProduced by Shachar Bar-On and Natalie Jimenez Peel.

       "  'body': 'Joe Biden is visiting Florida for the first time as the Democratic presidential nominee, amid questions about his ability to garner support from Latino voters, a crucial voting bloc in the Sunshine State. Biden will mark Hispanic Heritage Month in an event in Kissimmee on Tuesday evening.\\n\"I will talk about how I am going to work like the devil to make sure I turn every Latino and Hispanic vote,\" Biden told reporters on Monday about his plans for his trip to Florida. The former vice president also said that his overall support among Latino voters is \"much higher\" than support for Mr. Trump, but he acknowledged \"they\\'ve got to go higher.\"\\nAlthough Biden could still win the White House without Florida,\\xa0CBS News digital politics reporter Grace Segers\\xa0reports\\xa0the state is considered a linchpin for President Trump, who won its 29 electoral votes in 2016. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has committed to spending $100 million in the state to aid Biden. However, Biden\\'s support appears to be slipping among Latino voters, who make up roughly 26% of the state\\'s population. An\\xa0NBC News/Marist College poll\\xa0released earlier this month showed Biden lagging behind Mr. Trump among likely Latino voters, receiving 46% support from likely Latino voters compared to 50% support for Mr. Trump.\\xa0Exit polls\\xa0from 2016 showed that the majority of Latinos in the state backed Hillary Clinton, although Cubans were about twice as likely to support Mr. Trump as non-Cuban Latinos. Although Biden may have an uphill battle to attract Cuban voters, he has sought to strengthen his support among Puerto Rican voters, who also make up a significant portion of the population in Florida.\\nPuerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny allowed the Biden campaign to use his music in an ad which is airing in Pennsylvania and Florida. Biden has also harshly criticized Mr. Trump\\'s response to Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017.\\nOthers have questioned whether the Biden campaign is doing enough to reach out to the Latino community. Chuck Rocha, a former senior adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders\\' presidential campaigns,\\xa0told CBSN on Monday\\xa0that Biden was lagging among Latino voters in part because of \"a lack of money\" from his campaign on Latino outreach. \"The fact of the matter is there\\'s just not money going to take that message to Latinos as there needs to be,\" Rocha said. Javier Fernandez, a Democrat running for the state Senate in Miami-Dade County, told\\xa0CBS Miami\\xa0that there did not seem to be much enthusiasm for Biden among Latino voters in Florida. \"I don\\'t know that they\\'re super excited about Joe Biden,\" Fernandez said.\\nMr. Trump has also been working to appeal to Latino voters in recent weeks. He participated in a Latinos for Trump roundtable in Phoenix on Monday. Although some Latino voters are wary of Mr. Trump because of his anti-immigration policies, Biden has also faced criticism because of the high number of deportations implemented by the Obama administration. Biden\\xa0has said that he regrets\\xa0the deportations of migrants without criminal records under President Obama.\\nBiden also attended an event with veterans in Tampa on Tuesday. Biden, whose son served in the military, slammed Mr. Trump\\'s \"degradation of service members.\" A\\xa0poll by Monmouth University\\xa0released on Tuesday found that Mr. Trump leads Biden by just four percentage points in military households in Florida. Over one-third of the state\\'s electorate lives in military or veteran households.\\nAs the battle for the nation\\'s sliver of persuadable voters continues in earnest ahead of Election Day, the Trump campaign is back on the airwaves in Pennsylvania and Arizona - two states that begin early voting on October 7 and October 19, respectively.\\xa0CBS news campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\\xa0reports this week\\'s $12.8 million local television investment also buys the Trump campaign time in Florida, North Carolina, Michigan, Arizona, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Georgia, Maine and Nebraska, according to data from Kantar/CMAG.\\nAs polling shows the president\\'s messaging on safety and security\\xa0continuing to fall flat, his re-election bid has shifted its focus from Mr. Trump\\'s \"Law and Order\" mantra to the economy, touting\\xa0job creation\\xa0and\\xa0record unemployment numbers\\xa0among women and minority voters in new 30-second spots.

Though today marks Biden\\'s first in-person campaign stop in Florida as the Democratic presidential nominee.\\xa0Mitchell\\xa0notes that his campaign has hosted virtual events and launched ads appealing to Puerto Rican communities.\\nIn the\\xa0newest episode\\xa0of \"The Debrief with Major Garrett,\"\\xa0CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett\\xa0chronicles the past six months in the pandemic-plagued sports world.\\nThe delay of sports because of the pandemic led to a mega sports equinox on September 10 when all of the four major leagues - NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL - and a number of other sports competed on the same day.\\xa0\\nAthletes across the leagues have returned with calls for social justice and racial justice in the wake of George Floyd\\'s death at the hands of a police officer during the pandemic.\\n\"People expecting right now for sports to be some sort of a diversion from this horrible pandemic, got a rude awakening, because not only are people of color who make up the most of the sports that we watch the most, particularly football and basketball...,\" Washington Post Columnist Kevin Blackistone said. \"Not only are people of color predominant there, but they are also, unfortunately, the predominant victims of this pandemic, and so they\\'re feeling it on both ends.\" The episode also features interviews with Boston Celtics player Enes Kanter,\\xa0CBS Saturday Morning co-host Dana Jacobson, USA Today sports columnist Christine Brennan and others.\\nThe Michigan Senate passed a bill on Tuesday that would allow clerks to start processing absentee ballots one day before the general election, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster.\\nThe bill would allow clerks in cities with at least 25,000 people to do some pre-processing activities on Monday, such as opening envelopes, but would require ballots to remain in their secrecy sleeves. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson called it a \"step in the right direction\" but said the bill \"does not go nearly far enough\" to provide help for clerks.\\n\"I support the small step forward because I know at this point clerks will take any legislative assistance. But the bill comes up far short of what our clerks and voters deserve,\" Benson said in a statement. \"This bill allows only ten hours, only minimal processing, and includes a sunset provision that requires clerks to continue their advocacy in years to come. Ultimately, it does a disservice to the 1,500 election officials who work tirelessly for their communities and our democracy, and doesn\\'t do enough to bring about more timely election results.\"\\nThe bill passed 34-2. It now goes to the Michigan House.\\nIn a lawsuit brought by the Ohio Democratic Party against Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Franklin County judge ruled in favor of the Ohio Democratic Party, writing that LaRose did not have the legal authority to issue a directive limiting each of Ohio\\'s county boards of elections to only one ballot drop box per county.\\n\"No statute says that delivery must occur with only one box per county. No statute says that delivery would be improper to be a drop box controlled by a board and placed at a safe location separate and apart from the main board office,\" the judge wrote. \"The statute is silent on such matters. The Secretary cannot slip new words into the law.\"\\nCBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\\xa0says the judge also wrote that LaRose\\'s counsel noted that if the state ruled that additional drop boxes are required, LaRose\\'s office would need to implement the ruling. \"The Secretary has stated publicly he supports additional drop boxes if they are legal; and his lawyer represented on the record in the Northern District of Ohio that his client would abide by a state court ruling,\" the judge wrote. Maggie Sheehan, LaRose\\'s spokesperson, said in a statement that LaRose\\'s directive will remain in place. She also noted that the secretary\\'s office will appeal the ruling at the earliest possible opportunity.\\n\"Importantly, while the judge issued a declaration as to the law regarding the return of absentee ballots and drop boxes, he did not rule on the Plaintiff\\'s request to enjoin the Secretary\\'s Directive,\" Sheehan said. \"Lacking that, today\\'s ruling didn\\'t change anything and the Secretary\\'s Directive remains in place.\"\\nNORTH CAROLINA\\nRepublican Senator Thom Tillis and Democratic candidate Cal Cunningham faced off in the first debate for the general election Monday night.\\nIn the debate, Cunningham said he would not necessarily take a vaccine if one was offered, reports\\xa0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. He told the moderator, \"Yes, I would be hesitant, but I\\'m going to ask a lot of questions,\" adding, \"I think that\\'s incumbent on all of us right now.\"\\nAccording to\\xa0Joe Bruno of WSOC TV,\\xa0Cunningham said after the debate that he would take the vaccine if the FDA signs off on it and it is free of politics. Monday\\'s debate featured questions over how each candidate would ameliorate the suffering North Carolinians are experiencing because of coronavirus. The debate came 10 days after the state started sending out ballots to voters. The candidates were asked if they trust mail-in voting. Tillis said he trusts the system in North Carolina and will vote absentee, and Cunningham said he trusts the vote-by-mail system but plans to vote in-person next month.\\nMESSAGING\\nThe House GOP unveiled its 2021 agenda less than 50 days before election day, should it take back the House, reports\\xa0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.\\nIts \"Commitment to America\" plan focuses, in part, on getting a COVID-19 vaccine developed this year, increasing police funding by more than $1.75 billion and cutting American dependence on China.\\n\"We cannot slow the progress of America\\'s ingenuity or allow our science to be politicized,\" the plan says, adding that there should be investments in therapeutics and protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions. Some of these themes, such as supporting law enforcement, have already made their debut in House GOP campaign ads.\\nIn an\\xa0appearance\\xa0on the Capitol steps, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and other GOP leadership described a need to return to a pre-COVID America, while also slamming Democrats.\\n\"Two years ago, Speaker Pelosi promised the American people that Democrats would serve a responsibility to seek common ground. And she did the complete opposite,\" McCarthy said, before hitting House Democrats for impeachment and holding up COVID-19 legislation with their \"liberal wish list.\"\\nRepublicans need a net gain of 17 seats in order to flip the House, a task made harder by consistently high Democrat incumbent fundraising and a dispersed battlefield.

       "  'body': 'No matter what happens on debate night, one effort is for certain: fundraising. Both Joe Biden and President Trump sent out fundraising appeals ahead of their much-anticipated appearance in Ohio. While this is the first presidential debate of the general election, during the primary season,\\xa0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\\xa0reports presidential hopefuls used the debates to raise millions of dollars.\\nSince this morning, the Trump campaign has sent out at least a handful of fundraising emails mentioning the debate. \"TONIGHT is the FIRST Presidential Debate, and to help us CRUSH our End-of-Quarter goal, I want TODAY to be our BEST fundraising day EVER,\" read one appeal. Biden\\'s campaign also referenced the debate. \"So before Joe hits the stage for the first debate tonight, before he takes on Donald Trump himself, let\\'s show him we have his back,\" read an email to Biden supporters from President Obama. The Biden campaign also send out text appeals about raising funds before going \"toe-to-toe\" with the president. The debate comes just one day before the last day of the month, which is a major fundraising deadline for both candidates.\\nIn the run up to the first head-to-head presidential debate,\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\\xa0reports the Trump campaign\\xa0has called dibs on YouTube\\'s homepage, commandeering prime real estate atop the world\\'s second largest search engine for a full 24 hours. Part of a 7-figure digital ad blitz, the Trump campaign will spotlight a 2-minute clip from a viral YouTube video testimonial praising the president on the site\\'s own masthead. The new campaign ad, entitled \"I See A Way Out,\" features Gary Lamb, a Black truck driver who credits the president with granting him a \"second chance\" after struggling with depression and financial hardship. The Trump campaign has secured YouTube\\'s massive banner on over 20 occasions according to a campaign official, with plans to purchase the coveted ad space for a 72-hour\\xa0run up to Election Day.\\nCBS News White House digital reporter Kathryn Watson\\xa0reports\\xa0that as protests and deadly violence have erupted in American cities, the president\\'s campaign has sought to tap into powerful human emotions -- fear and anxiety. Pointing to the\\xa0fires set in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the storefronts with smashed windows in\\xa0Kenosha, Wisconsin, and the shooting of police officers in Los Angeles and\\xa0Louisville, Kentucky, Mr. Trump\\'s message is clear, that it will not only continue, but will spread to the suburbs if he\\'s not reelected. It\\'s not a new strategy, but it\\'s also no sure bet that what worked for Mr. Trump in 2016, when he was an outsider who had never held office, will work in 2020 when he\\'s the incumbent. The president, who is struggling in the suburbs, particularly among women and college-educated voters, is pressing the argument that Biden can\\'t keep them safe, even though the scenes on television are unfolding during his presidency.\\nAhead of the first presidential debate, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\\xa0released his 2019 tax returns, a swipe after The New York Times report on Mr. Trump\\'s taxes. The former vice president has now released 22 years of his tax returns during his campaign,\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\\xa0reports. Biden\\'s tax records show he and former second lady Jill Biden continued to earn significantly more money than they earned at any time before the vice presidency. The couple\\'s income for 2019 was $944,737 from book royalties, positions at colleges and other income. The two earned millions in 2017 and 2018 from book deals and speaking fees after leaving the White House. CBS News calculated the Bidens for the past three years have paid an effective federal tax rate between 30% to 33%. Ahead of the debate, the Biden campaign hit back at the Trump campaign for floating supposed debate planning details. Deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield on a pre-debate press call said it is \"completely absurd,\" \"pathetic\" and \"weak\" for the Trump campaign to insinuate Biden may try to wear an ear piece during the debate. Bedingfield said Trump staffers are getting nervous the president will not have a good debate performance and are trying to distract from his record. For their part, the Biden campaign also accused the Trump campaign of requesting that debate moderator Chris Wallace refrain from mentioning the total of more than 200,000 Americans dead from coronavirus. \"He doesn\\'t have a plan for the crises facing our country so instead of focusing on the things that matter to the millions of people watching at home tonight, they\\'re trying to get everyone to dangle a shiny object in front of the press,\" Bedingfield added. Senior adviser Symone Sanders also said on the call it is the moderator\\'s job -- not Biden\\'s -- to fact check the president if necessary. Expecting attacks on the Biden family, Sanders argued, \"Frankly, voters don\\'t want to hear President Trump rehash false attacks about Vice President Biden and his family.\"\\nFrom an outsider\\'s perspective, North Carolina may be synonymous with the burgeoning city of Charlotte -- the site of the official business of this year\\'s Republican National Convention. For others, the state is synonymous with University of North Carolina Chapel Hill\\'s Tar Heels. Whatever the affiliation, political scientists tell\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\\xa0that the impact of this election could be seen outside of the state\\'s metro areas. Take Granville County. Just 40 or so miles outside of Wake county -- home to the capital city of Raleigh -- Granville County is one of 6 North Carolina counties that voted for Mr. Trump after having voted for President Obama in 2012. Having only seen about an 8.7% increase in population -- roughly 500 residents -- Granville has a population of about 60,000. And though the county\\'s population isn\\'t even a full percentage point of the state\\'s 7.1 million registered voters, Meredith College political science professor David McLennan tells\\xa0Mitchell\\xa0that it\\'s one of four bellwether counties that he suspects will determine how the state will play out. In 2016, Mr. Trump won the state of North Carolina by 3.66%, a gap that the Trump campaign is looking to expand in North Carolina. With eight visits to the state this year, the president has made five trips to the Tar Heel State in the past month and pro-Trump organizations are set to spend more than $4 million in the state before Election Day.\\nIn Granville, the county\\'s margin of victory in presidential races has continued to shrink since 2008. In 2016, Mr. Trump won Granville County with 682 votes, or 2.58%. However, eight years earlier, the county first elected President Obama with a 6.58% margin of victory. In neighboring Wake County, Kathy Martin is an independent voter who tends to lean Democratic but likes to leave her choices open. She said that Mr. Trump may have trouble winning over independents like her, and in Granville County, there were more than 85,000 unaffiliated voters who participated in the 2016 general election. \"There\\'s a lot of independents like me who might have voted for Trump last time, who are going to vote Biden this time because of what Trump has done, his political motivations, and the way he tears things up,\" she said.\\nFor the Trump campaign, outside spending by Pro-Trump super PACs cannot come fast enough -- the president\\'s re-election bid has been outspent by Biden 2-1 on TV advertisements in September alone, according to Kantar/CMAG data. \"America First\" PAC announced Tuesday it will invest $40 million more on a mix of television, digital and direct mail advertisements in the battleground states of Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Georgia in the remaining days before November 3, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. A new economic ad - \"Day One\" - begins airing in the Philadelphia market on Wednesday. But Team Trump\\'s most loyal super PAC is not the only outside GOP group spending big this fall. A new Republican super PAC - \"Preserve America\" - has sprung up in recent weeks. Steered by Chris LaCivita, a veteran Republican strategist who devised the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth takedown of John Kerry in 2004, the outside group is poised to spend $80 million in September, providing a sorely needed boost to the presidential and Senate races amid the Trump campaign\\'s cash crunch.\\nIn the\\xa0latest episode\\xa0of \"The Debrief with Major Garrett,\"\\xa0CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett\\xa0explores presidential power and its limits, uses and abuses. In interviews with legal experts, he asks, \"Can the president do that?\" The bounds of presidential power have been defined and redefined since the nation\\'s founding. During his convention speech in 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump proclaimed, \"Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it.\" Not Congress, nor the courts, nor the states or any other institution we vest with power. When Congress failed to act on immigration, President Obama\\'s executive action created the DACA program for children brought to the United States illegally by their parents. Mr. Trump unilaterally redirected military funds to build a wall on the southern border, after congress declined to fund it.\\n\"It\\'s not even about Donald Trump personally in this moment,\" Kim Wehle, a professor of law at the University of Baltimore and a CBS News contributor, said. \"It\\'s about the job description of the presidency turning into something that can easily be abused, which is exactly what the framers were worried about, the psychology that is human to abuse power if you have too much of it.\"\\nArizona Republican party chair Kelli Ward late Monday dismissed the news of Cindy McCain\\'s growing role supporting Joe Biden,\\xa0following the announcement that\\xa0the widow of the late Arizona senator would be joining the former vice president\\'s transition team as a member of its advisory board. \"There is no blue wave in this state and we are firmly, firmly in the camp of conservative Republican values that President Trump embodies,\" Ward said Monday in a press call, touting \"over 43,000 trained volunteers on the ground\" in the battleground state.\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\\xa0says the former vice president\\'s campaign has often touted its voter contact efforts in \"traditionally Republican areas\" in Arizona, showcasing a growing roster of \"Arizona Republicans for Biden.\"\\xa0As of last count, Republicans had edged out Democrats by nearly 100,000 registered voters in the state.\\nMichigan\\'s previous two Secretaries of State filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday over a recent decision by a court of claims judge to extend the deadline for absentee ballots to be received, according to\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. Republican state Senator Ruth Johnson and former Republican Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land are challenging the decision from a state judge that said absentee ballots should count if they arrive by November 17 as long as they are postmarked by November 2. Michigan normally requires absentee ballots to be turned in by 8:00pm local time (there\\'s a slice of Michigan in the central time zone but polls always close at 8:00p local). \"The Michigan Legislature has established a bright-line deadline of 8:00 p.m. on November 3, 2020 -- the Election Day Congress set by law -- for mail-in ballots to arrive at polling places. Ballots that fail to meet this deadline are not to be counted,\" the complaint says. According to the Michigan Secretary of State\\'s office, a record 2.55 million Michiganders have requested absentee ballots for the general election. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has estimated more than 3 million people may vote absentee in Michigan. In 2018, voters amended the state constitution to allow for no-excuse absentee voting.\\nLocal health authorities in northern Nevada say that the case disclosed by state health authorities this week among attendees \"to a political rally,\" as reported\\xa0by the Las Vegas Review Journal, has been determined not to be connected to the event. \"It was determined during the case investigation that the individual, due to timing of symptom onset, did not get COVID-19 at the political rally so there is no connection between this case and a political rally,\" Jessica Rapp, public information officer for Carson City Health and Human Services, said in a statement Tuesday.\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\\xa0reports authorities in southern Nevada last week acknowledged a recent uptick in cases following the president\\'s events throughout the state earlier this month in defiance of rules against large gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, the agency also said it had not \"identified a link to any specific gathering.\"\\nMr. Trump pledged\\xa0late last week\\xa0to return \"soon\" to New Mexico, where his campaign has poured resources into a longshot bid to flip a state he lost by some eight points in 2016. Now a spokesperson for the state\\'s Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, is warning the president against holding any events in violation of the state\\'s caps on large gatherings, according to\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. \"Gatherings of more than 10 people are currently prohibited in New Mexico and political events are not exempt. Should the president continue to display his reckless disregard for public health and safety by violating the state\\'s public health order, the state will pursue consequences for him and his campaign,\" Nora Meyers Sackett, Lujan Grisham\\'s press secretary, said Tuesday in an email. In his post, the president touted progress on barriers along New Mexico\\'s southern border Mexico, 69 miles of which have so far been completed in the state according to a Customs and Border Patrol official. In some recent trips to neighboring Arizona, the president has repeatedly returned to mark progress in the wall\\'s construction. Mr. Trump last visited New Mexico little\\xa0more than a year ago, hosting a rally near Albuquerque.\\nThe Ohio Secretary of State announced in a press release that the state\\'s county boards of elections have received 2,000,489 absentee ballot applications as of September 25. At the same point during the 2016 election cycle, 957,260 absentee ballots were requested, according to\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. While absentee ballots for military and overseas voters started being mailed out two weeks ago, other absentee ballots will begin to be mailed to voters who requested an absentee ballot on October 6. \"Every voter choosing to cast their ballot from the comfort of their own home makes for an even smoother voting experience for those choosing to vote in-person on election day,\" LaRose said in a statement. \"It\\'s a win-win for everyone.\"\\nUP FOR DEBATE\\nIn a sort of pre-game to Tuesday\\'s presidential debate, three battleground state hosted Senate debates on Monday where candidates sparred over the coronavirus response, the Supreme Court, and Mr. Trump\\'s tax returns.\\xa0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\\xa0reports that in Iowa, Republican Senator Joni Ernst said in response to a question on the story on Mr. Trump\\'s tax returns that the president should release his tax returns, but she questioned where The New York Times got access to the financial data. On the Supreme Court, Ernst said she is pro-life but does not believe the Supreme Court would overturn Roe vs. Wade. Her opponent, Democratic candidate Theresa Greenfield, told the moderators she opposed packing the Supreme Court, and Maine Democratic Senate candidate Sara Gideon did not endorse specific reforms but said the court should be less political. In Montana, Democratic Governor Steve Bullock has said the next president should nominate the next Supreme Court justice, and in the debate, he, like Gideon and Greenfield, reminded viewers that the Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on the Affordable Care Act a week after the election. All three Republican senators touted their work in the Senate on passing the CARES act that provided needed relief to Americans suffering through the impacts of the coronavirus.\\nNORTH CAROLINA\\nIn an internal Democrat poll first shared with\\xa0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro, the race in North Carolina\\'s 8th Congressional district is remaining steady for House candidates and shifting for the presidential. A July internal poll for this seat in central North Carolina showed Biden leading Mr. Trump by one point. A late September poll of 614 likely voters shows Trump leading by 3%. For the House toplines, Democrat challenger Pat Timmons-Goodson is still down two points to incumbent Republican Richard Hudson, though her campaign\\'s poll did show her up 6% with swing voters and up in name identification. This seat was redrawn in 2019 to include more of the Democrat leaning Cumberland County. Congressman Hudson has held the seat since 2013, but when asked who voters would vote for if the race was held today, Hudson got 39% compared to Timmons-Goodson\\'s 47%. About 13% were still undecided or refused to answer.\\nSOUTH CAROLINA\\nSouth Carolina\\'s 1st Congressional district had their\\xa0first debate\\xa0Monday night, as freshman Democrat Joe Cunningham looks to retain his Lowcountry seat against Republican Nancy Mace.\\xa0Navarro\\xa0reports that for a good amount of the debate, Cunningham and Mace went back and forth over each other\\'s vote attendance and record. Cunningham criticized Mace\\'s missed votes as a state lawmaker, saying it shows how effective she\\'d be in Congress. \"Now imagine this, you\\'re at home, one of your employees calls in sick 30% of the time. Then they come to you and ask you for a promotion...that\\'s how ridiculous this is,\" Cunningham said. Mace consistently brought up her role as a single mother to justify missed votes, as well as when she was diagnosed with COVID-19. \"I think it\\'s reprehensible and shameful that you would attack a single working mom for making the decision to be with her children,\" Mace responded. \"I have to make some tough decisions... this is an unprecedented time for single parents.\" The two also debated climate change, a relevant topic for the district due to flooding in Charleston and off-shore drilling. When asked if she believes in climate change, Mace argued the science isn\\'t \"settled\" and that scientists have changed their minds before. \"Scientists once said the earth is flat. It is not,\" she said. Cunningham brought up the rising sea levels for Parris Island and its Marine Corps training site. \"If you don\\'t believe in climate change or you\\'re a flat earther, then you probably love my opponent Representative Mace,\" he said. Mace repeatedly hit Cunningham on a vote he had on a bill that would affect funding to the area, and on Tuesday, she spoke at the boot camp. From the beginning of this cycle, this district was seen as one of the marquee opportunities for Republicans to flip, as Mr. Trump won the area by 12.7 points. On Tuesday, the Cook Political Report recently moved their rating for this race from \"Toss Up\" to \"Lean Democrat,\" pointing to internal polls showing a tied presidential race.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Future presidential debates between President Trump and Joe Biden have been called into question after the commission that organizes the event said it would be held virtually to minimize the risk of spreading the coronavirus,\\xa0CBS News managing editor for politics Stefan Becket\\xa0and\\xa0campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\\xa0report. The Commission on Presidential Debates announced the second debate scheduled for October 15 in Miami would instead feature virtual appearances by the two candidates, a change the president quickly dismissed as \"not acceptable.\" In an interview with Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo earlier in the morning Mr. Trump said, \"I\\'m not going to waste my time on a virtual debate. That\\'s not what debating is all about,\" He added, \"You sit behind a computer and do a debate, it\\'s ridiculous. And then they cut you off whenever they want.\" Mr. Trump\\'s decision to forgo the event led the Biden campaign to back out as well, with deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield urging the commission to reschedule the town hall for the following week. Bedingfield said the campaign was prepared to accept the new format, but would now \"find an appropriate place to take questions from voters directly\" on the day of the debate.\\nBill Stepien, Mr. Trump\\'s campaign manager who also recently tested positive for the virus, confirmed the president\\'s decision. \"We\\'ll pass on this sad excuse to bail out Joe Biden and do a rally instead,\" he said in a statement. In a second statement, Stepien agreed that the second debate should be moved to October 22, and the third to October 29. But the Biden campaign rejected Stepien\\'s proposal to push the third and final debate back, with Bedingfield issuing yet another statement saying, \"Donald Trump doesn\\'t make the debate schedule; the Debate Commission does.\" \\xa0Hours later,\\xa0ABC News announced\\xa0it would be conducting a town hall event with Biden on October 15, moderated by George Stephanopoulos.\\xa0\\nIn its unexpected announcement early Thursday morning, the nonpartisan debate commission said the second debate would \"take the form of a town meeting, in which the candidates would participate from separate remote locations.\" The change was made \"to protect the health and safety of all involved with the second presidential debate,\" the group said, and appeared to take both campaigns by surprise. Mr. Trump told Fox Business that the commission had not informed the campaign of their decision to alter the format of the debate before announcing it publicly. A source familiar with the ongoing debate negotiations told CBS News that the commission did not consult either campaign before making the move, saying the commission \"decided this unilaterally.\" The president tested positive for the coronavirus and began experiencing symptoms a week ago, on October 1, according to White House physician Sean Conley. As of Wednesday, the president had been symptom-free for more than 24 hours, according to Conley.\\nMr. Trump has not been seen in person since his return to the White House from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Monday,\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\\xa0reports. Instead, the president has issued a series of short videos distributed on social media. After calling into Fox Business News for an hour-long interview on Thursday, the president posted two video messages to Twitter, including a direct appeal to seniors. \"So to my favorite people in the world -- the seniors. I\\'m a senior. I know you don\\'t know that. Nobody knows that. Maybe you don\\'t have to tell them, but I\\'m a senior,\" the president began. Mr. Trump promised senior citizens that the therapeutic medications -- including the antibody cocktail Regeneron -- he took at Walter Reed to treat his illness would soon be made available to them for no cost. \"We\\'re taking care of our seniors. You\\'re not vulnerable but they like to say you\\'re vulnerable. You\\'re the least vulnerable but for this one thing, you are vulnerable. So am I,\" the president remarked. \"So we\\'re going to take care of our seniors -- all free!\" Mr. Trump roundly criticized democratic rival Biden at the end of the video, claiming the former vice president \"didn\\'t know what he was doing\" at the onset of the swine flu. \"But I do know what I\\'m doing,\" Mr. Trump said. While just over 12,000 Americans died of H1N1 from 2009-10 according to\\xa0CDC estimates,\\xa0over 210,000 have died\\xa0in the United States from COVID-19. In his first remarks since Wednesday\\'s debate, Vice President Mike Pence told the Boulder City, Nevada, crowd that Mr. Trump\\'s agenda won the night. \"A lot of talk this morning on TV about who won the debate. But I think when you compare the Biden-Harris agenda with what President Donald Trump has done and will continue to do for America, there\\'s no question for who won the debate. President Donald Trump won the debate hands down,\" Pence said near the beginning of his remarks.\\xa0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\\xa0reports that during the rally, Pence continued talking points he had on Wednesday. Pence critiqued Biden on saying he won\\'t increase taxes but would still try to repeal Mr. Trump\\'s tax cuts, and claimed Biden would end fracking and he called the vice president \"hysterical\" about Mr. Trump\\'s China ban at the onset of the pandemic. Pence also said last night made it clear that Biden would want to \"pack\" the Supreme Court, referencing Biden and Harris\\' dodging answers on the question. He thanked the crowd of about 50 people for their well wishes for Mr. Trump as he was hospitalized from COVID-19. Pence, who has been the campaign\\'s top surrogate as Mr.Trump recovers from the coronavirus, said the president would be back on the campaign trail \"before you know it.\" In addition to Nevada, Pence also traveled to the battleground of Arizona on Thursday.\\nBiden and Harris are campaigning in Arizona on Thursday, marking their first joint appearance on the campaign trail since the Democratic National Convention, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. Biden again declined to say whether he would add more justices to the United States Supreme Court if he wins the election. \"You will know my opinion on court packing when the election is over,\" Biden said. \"But you know the moment I answer that question the headline in every one of your papers will be about that other than, other than focusing on what is happening now. The election has begun. There has never been a court appointment once an election begun.\" Biden was also asked about the plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer that state and federal prosecutors unveiled on Thursday. He said Mr. Trump hasn\\'t done enough to condemn hate groups. \"Look the words of a president matter. Whether they can - you heard me say this before. They can cause a nation to have the market rise or fall. Go to war. Bring peace. But they can also breathe oxygen into those who are filled with hate and danger. And I just think it\\'s got to stop,\" Biden said, according to\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Biden and Harris also visited Arizona\\'s Heard Museum, which showcases American Indian art and shares the stories of American Indian people. Cindy McCain, the wife of the late Republican Senator John McCain and who recently endorsed Mr. Biden, joined the Democratic ticket. Biden and Harris later spoke at a bus tour kickoff event.\\nAnd in the wake of last night\\'s vice presidential debate,\\xa0CBS News political reporter Ed O\\'Keefe\\xa0reports the Biden campaign says it raised a little more than $12 million. The donations included those who opted to buy a $10 dollar \"Truth Over Flies\" fly swatter the campaign quickly ordered up after a fly landed in the hair of Vice President Pence. The campaign says it sold out of the roughly 35,000 fly swatters they ordered within hours. The campaign was also touting the growing success of its voter registration website, IWillVote.com. In one night, the campaign says the website had more than a third of the traffic than it had in the entire month of September. Much of the traffic was driven by the campaign\\'s decision to quickly buy a vanity URL - FlyWillVote.com.\\nSoutheast Michigan is home to the state\\'s latest population center: Detroit and its surrounding suburbs. Two of those suburban counties, Macomb and Oakland, will play a large role in determining whether Mr. Trump wins Michigan again, according to\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. But the counties have their differences. Macomb has long been a swing county with many working class voters who have been the core of Mr. Trump\\'s base. Oakland is a wealthier county, with a larger population of college educated voters, including many women and Independents who have revolted against Mr. Trump.\\nMacomb County is often pointed to as the bellwether of Michigan. Since 2006, the candidate who has won the county has also won statewide in gubernatorial and presidential races. Former President Obama won the county twice, though his margins went from winning by 8.5 in 2008 to winning by 4 in 2012. A boost from white working class voters in the county helped propel President Trump to an 11.5 point win in 2016 and his strength in the county helped fuel his upset win in Michigan. In 2018, however, Michigan\\'s Democratic Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, turned the county blue again, winning by 3.5 points. Cecil St. Pierre, chair of the Michigan 9th District Republicans, which includes Macomb County, said Whitmer ran a better campaign than her Republican opponent, but believes Republicans have seen a boost in volunteer support in 2020. He also said Whitmer\\'s COVID policies, which have drawn sharp criticism from conservatives, helped drive support for the president. \"What Whitmer has done and what she tries to do, she\\'s been the best help for the president,\" St. Pierre said, referring to her use of emergency powers during the pandemic. A recent\\xa0Detroit News/WDIV\\xa0poll showed Whitmer\\'s approval rating at 59%, but St. Pierre brushed that off, saying Republicans in his county have been upset with her actions. Other issues driving voters, he said, are trade, law and order, immigration and economic concerns. The Biden campaign has made a major push in Macomb County too. Biden has admitted he may not win back all of the working-class Democrats who voted for Mr. Obama then Mr. Trump, but said it\\'s about shaving the margins. Biden held an event in Macomb County in September and earlier this week Senator Bernie Sanders stumped for Biden in the county. Representative Andy Levin, a Democrat who represents part of Macomb County, acknowledged the massive displays of enthusiasm for Mr. Trump around the county. But, he believes Mr. Biden\\'s leadership will help him, especially during COVID. \"That\\'s the kind of unifying leader Joe Biden is and I think the people sense it,\" Levin said. \"They\\'re sick of this not taking the biggest public health crisis in a century seriously.\"\\nOakland County has been more solidly blue during presidential cycles for the last two decades, but a strong Republican base helped former Republican Governor Rick Snyder win by double digit margins in 2010 and 2014. In 2012 and 2016, Mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton won Oakland by about 8 points. Whitmer blew the doors open in 2018, when many independent and suburban women rejected Republicans, to win by 17 points. Democrats also flipped two U.S. House seats held by Republicans and some state legislative seats during the 2018 midterms. State Representative Mari Manoogian, whose district includes some of the wealthiest Oakland County communities, won her race by 13 points after a Republican carried it by 7 points in 2016. She said her constituents are worried about public education, healthcare and COVID. Many have also been turned off by Mr. Trump\\'s political style, she said. \"The president\\'s brand of politics, the way that he behaves, the kind of just negative engagement he has with his co-workers, frankly, with other co-equal branches of government, it\\'s not something that sits well with the folks in my district,\" Manoogian said. Oakland County Republican Party chair Rocky Raczkowski admitted 2018 was a strong year for Democrats and believes a ballot initiative to legalize marijuana may have helped the Democratic candidates increase their margins. He said Republicans in the county are focused on safety, security and economic issues. Raczkowski said that there\\'s been a major effort by a group of women leading Women for Trump events and supporters showing up have been ready to volunteer and spread the word about Mr. Trump. Still, he thinks there\\'s room for Republicans to improve their messaging to women voters. \"Maybe we do a poor job of marketing and expressing how the Republican Party actually does what the majority of women feel that the government should be doing,\" Raczkowski said. \"We\\'re praying that obviously that people realize what\\'s at stake in this election.\"\\nIn one of the biggest school districts in the country, some students are so satisfied with virtual learning that they see no benefit in returning to in-person learning until the threat of contracting COVID-19 has abated or a vaccine is widely available, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. \"I\\'m very, very lucky to have some really, really awesome teachers,\" said Houston high school senior Jennifer Hamad. \"I don\\'t think if my teachers were on the moon that would change.\" And Hamad, who is the speaker of the Houston Independent School District Student Congress, fears that \"sending students back to school right now, prematurely, creates more disruption and is more disruptive and dangerous to students\\' lives than it is beneficial.\" The Houston Independent School District (HISD) is allowing families to choose whether to keep students learning at home or in-person. Hamad and the student congress don\\'t think that the district has done enough to keep students, teachers, and faculty safe for in-person learning. \"It\\'s unethical to make people fit into that environment,\" she said. \"You\\'re needlessly putting lives at risk by making people do in-person instruction.\"\\xa0Read more\\xa0here\\xa0about the Houston student group who want school to remain virtual until a vaccine.\\nThe number of Americans applying for first-time jobless aid dipped last week but remained at a high level, indicating ongoing woes in the job market,\\xa0reports\\xa0CBS News digital data reporter Irina Ivanova. Some 840,000 adults filed initial unemployment claims in the week ended October 3, the Labor Department\\xa0said\\xa0Thursday. That figure, adjusted for seasonal variation, was down by 9,000 claims from the prior week and was in line with economists\\' forecasts. Another 464,000 people applied for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a broader program intended for self-employed and gig workers. This was the first time in two months that applications for self-employed aid dipped below half a million. Still, the number of jobless applications is significantly higher than it was at the peak of the Great Recession. All told, 25.5 million people were receiving some form of unemployment aid in the week that ended September 19, the latest period for which data is available, the Associated Press reported. Underscoring the fragility of industries battered by the coronavirus, large companies\\xa0including American Airlines, United Airlines\\xa0and Disney\\xa0have recently announced tens of thousands of jobs cuts. Economists are also concerned about the impact of colder weather on the\\xa0coronavirus pandemic\\xa0and the toll it could take on the labor market. \"If cooler weather pushes infections up again as people move indoors, the very modest decline in jobless claims could easily become a renewed spike,\" Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a report. \"Either way, they are far too high, still well above the 665,000 peak -- for one week -- seen after the crash of 2008.\" This week\\'s figures are less reliable than usual since California, the state with the most unemployment applications, has paused new filings for two weeks while it works out its backlog of claims. Across the country, hiring has slowed just as federal relief aid has run out, hampering an economy still reeling from the pandemic. Employers\\xa0added 661,000 jobs in September, less than half of August\\'s gain and the third straight monthly decline. At the same time, Congress and the White House are at loggerheads over talks to inject another round of stimulus into the economy. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned earlier this week that a slowing economy could\\xa0create a \"downward spiral\"\\xa0leading to further job cuts and urging lawmakers to pass a stimulus package. Just over half the 22 million jobs lost to the coronavirus have been recovered, leaving the economy with 10.7 million fewer jobs than in February -- a figure that exceeds all the job losses from the 2008-2009 Great Recession. \"The suffering facing the unemployed still reaches far and wide, and the failure to provide any aid for American workers will reverberate throughout the economy,\" Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, said in a statement.\\nAhead of a flurry of stops in Arizona from Pence, Biden and Harris this week, buses from both campaigns made appearances in the battleground state as Arizonans began to cast their first early ballots. The \"Team Trump on Tour\" bus rallied supporters ahead of the debate on Wednesday with top Republicans in the state, including\\xa0Senator Martha McSally. The Biden campaign rallied supporters starting in the Navajo Nation, though the stop\\xa0appeared to violate\\xa0the tribe\\'s COVID-19 restrictions.\\nAlso in Arizona, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals\\xa0ruled late Wednesday\\xa0against the Republican National Committee and the Senate GOP\\'s campaign arm, denying their request to undo a lower court\\'s decision to extend the cutoff of the state\\'s voter registration to October 23rd, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Arizona\\'s secretary of state, a Democrat, had said she does not plan to appeal the decision. However, the judges said they would \"reconsider the request\" to stay the lower court\\'s ruling from Arizona Attorney General Mark Bronvich, a Republican, who has moved to intervene as a defendant in the appeal. The case is among a handful of court battles still raging in the battleground state, even as Arizonans have since begun early voting. Brnovich\\xa0recently persuaded\\xa0the appeals court to stay a decision in their legal fight with the Arizona Democratic Party over whether voters will have time after Election Day to fix unsigned ballots.\\nDays after voting and civil rights groups filed a complaint against Florida\\'s Governor Ron DeSantis and Secretary of State Laurel M. Lee regarding the state\\'s voter registration deadline, U.S. District Judge Mark Walker heard arguments from the parties involved in the lawsuit during a telephone hearing Thursday morning.\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\\xa0reports that the complaint was filed Tuesday, the same day that Lee issued a directive extending the state\\'s voter registration deadline until 7 p.m. on October 6 following technical difficulties with the online voter registration portal hours before the state\\'s initial registration deadline on October 5. During the hearing Thursday, Walker made clear that voters were not at fault in this instance. \"We keep focusing on the voter. The voters didn\\'t sabotage the Secretary of State\\'s website. It failed. It failed the people of Florida,\" Walker said during a telephone hearing Thursday. \"Somebody\\'s relying on the state\\'s promise \\'you can register online, you can register until midnight on October 5th,\\' it\\'s a covenant between Secretary Lee and the people of Florida, and the system fails. Help me to understand why is that a minimum burden on their right?\" Walker also listed factors like the pandemic, more absentee ballots being cast, and supervisors of elections\\' resources being stretched as variables to be considered when determining whether to extend the voter registration deadline again ahead of the general election less than 30 days away. \"Historically, Florida hasn\\'t managed to count the votes properly when there\\'s not a pandemic,\" said Walker. However the representative for the plaintiffs noted that because registrations would be coming in electronically, they should be easier to process. The representative also conceded that either way there will be an issue whether it\\'s with election administration or voter confusion, \"either way it\\'s people who are excluded for invalid reason [and] can\\'t participate.\" Walker could make a decision as early as Thursday afternoon.\\nFederal and state authorities have unveiled charges against 13 people accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer, according to\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster.\\xa0According to a federal complaint unsealed on Thursday, six of those people face charges of conspiring to kidnap Whitmer. The affidavit alleges one of the accused men said Whitmer had \"uncontrolled power right now.\" Whitmer faced backlash from conservatives for her use of emergency powers to issue executive orders to fight COVID-19. Recently, the state Supreme Court ruled that one of the laws she used to issue those executive orders was unconstitutional. Michigan Attorney Dana Nessel also announced charges at the state level against seven more people. She said they are linked to a militia group known as the Wolverine Watchmen. Nessel said the individuals \"made threats of violence to instigate a civil war\" and \"engaged in the planning and training\" of an operation to \"attack the state Capitol building and kidnap government officials, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\" Whitmer said she hopes there are convictions to bring \"these sick and depraved men to justice\" and said now should be a time for national unity. Whitmer slammed President Trump not denouncing far-right groups like The Proud Boys, whom he told to \"stand back and stand by\" during last week\\'s debate. \"Hate groups heard the president\\'s words not as a rebuke, but as a rallying cry, as a call to action,\" Whitmer said. \"Hatred, bigotry and violence have no place in the great state of Michigan. If you break the law or conspire to commit heinous acts of violence against anyone, we will find you, we will hold you accountable and we will bring you to justice.\"\\nTop aides for the Biden campaign in Nevada say they are mounting a concerted push to turn out Latino voters in the battleground state over the final weeks before Election Day, blanketing the state with Spanish-language volunteers, campaign events, and new television and radio ads, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. Only the Biden campaign has any future reservations on Spanish-language television stations in Nevada, booking more than $275,000 in advertising according to Kantar/CMAG data.\\nThe Franklin County Board of Elections held a press conference to provide an update on some voters receiving incorrect ballots in the mail. The board still does not know how many voters were affected. Elections director Ed Leonard told reporters that one of the functions of one of the scanners was disabled and that was determined to be the \"root cause\" of the issue that led to some voters receiving an incorrect ballot. Leonard said that Bluecrest, the system vendor for the county, told the board that the issue occurred on October 3 at 2:24pm. At this moment,\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\\xa0reports the board said there is no indication or belief that there was nefarious intent behind the issue. The board added that Bluecrest will be able to determine who was logged in to the machine while the switch was disabled. \"Let me assure you no vote will be counted twice and every voter will receive an accurate ballot and that ballot will be counted,\" Leonard said. Voters who received an incorrect ballot and who do not want to wait for their replacement ballot can vote in person at the early vote center in the county. Leonard added that once there is a finalized list of impacted voters, the timeline for replacement ballots to be issued and produced is 72 hours. Leonard added that the issue does not appear to be related the volume of ballots requested and processed. \"We are confident that we can handle the number of ballots that are being requested and the number of ballots that are being returned,\" he said.\\nWith less than a month until Election Day, Pennsylvania lawmakers are still trying to fix a logistical challenge that local officials statewide have repeatedly\\xa0warned\\xa0could delay results. Pennsylvania state House Representative Kevin Boyle, a Democrat, on Thursday introduced a bill that would let counties begin pre-canvassing mail ballots 10 days before Election Day rather than waiting until Nov. 3. Early mail ballot processing is allowed in three dozen states according to\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak, but Pennsylvania makes counties wait until Election Day to begin even the earliest stages of ballot processing. Pennsylvania\\'s governor and secretary of state, both Democrats, have each asked the legislature to allow counties three weeks of pre-canvassing, which refers to a time when they can open envelopes, check signatures and scan ballots, but not record or publish totals. At the start of last month, compromise appeared near as the GOP-controlled state House moved to pass a bill that would give counties three days or pre-canvassing. Governor Tom Wolf had initially touted the bill as a sign the two sides would reach an agreement. But because Republicans attached provisions that would drastically limit the use of drop boxes for returning mail ballots and allow campaign representatives to serve as poll watchers outside their own counties, Wolf changed course and said he would veto the bill. In Pennsylvania\\'s June primary, the first when voters could cast ballots by mail without an excuse, over 1.5 million residents did so. The influx of mail voting coupled with still running an in-person election left counties overwhelmed and still counting ballots in some cases two weeks after Primary Day. The effect was that the leading candidate in 10 down ballot races changed after Election Day. In the upcoming general election, nearly a million more Pennsylvanians have already applied to vote by mail with over two weeks remaining to do so.\\nThe 7th Circuit Court of Appeals put a stay on a decision from a district court judge to extend Wisconsin\\'s absentee ballot deadline by six days, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. In September, a district court judge ruled that ballots should be counted if they are postmarked by November 3 and arrive by November 9. Normally, absentee ballots are due when the polls close on Election Day. The Republican-controlled legislature appealed that decision and the 7th Circuit initially ruled that the Legislature didn\\'t have standing to bring the case, which left the extended deadline in place. After a decision from the Wisconsin Supreme Court found that the Legislature could bring the appeal, the 7th Circuit put a stay on the lower court\\'s decision, meaning the normal deadline is in place for absentee ballots. Democrats could appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The 7th Circuit judges said that the decision came too close Election Day and that political leaders should make these decisions, not judges. In a dissent, Judge Illana Rovner said he decision could mean \"thousands of Wisconsin citizens will lose their right to vote despite doing everything they reasonably can to exercise it.\" She added \"Good luck and G-d bless, Wisconsin. You are going to need it.\"\\nAD SPENDING\\nDemocratic Senate hopefuls are spending big on ads in key battleground states. In some cases, the Democrats have outspent Republican incumbents by as much as 2 to 1, according to\\xa0CBS News political unit associate producers Sarah Ewall-Wice\\xa0and\\xa0Eleanor\\xa0Watson. Democrats face a friendlier map than in 2018 and have been gearing up for a battle to take control of a chamber that had been under Republican leadership since 2015. The late inning addition of a Supreme Court vacancy has only added fuel to the fire and cash to their war chests. In North Carolina, a race now upended by both a\\xa0scandal\\xa0involving Democrat Cal Cunningham\\'s flirtatious text messages and Republican\\xa0Senator Thom Tillis testing positive for coronavirus, about $130 million has already been spent on ads and another $35 million at least is expected by Election Day according to tracking by Kantar/CMAG. Cunningham alone has spent nearly $18 million already in comparison to Tillis\\' just $5.5 million on a race that has them neck-and-neck before word of the scandal broke. The match-up between Democrat\\xa0Mark Kelly\\xa0and incumbent Republican Senator Martha McSally in Arizona has netted an eye-popping $116 million in ads, including spending from outside groups. In Kelly\\'s quest to take the seat, he has spent $37 million on ads compared to McSally\\'s $18.6 million so far. And in the two-woman race in Maine, where polls show Senator Susan Collins trailing Democrat Sara Gideon as the Senator campaigns between a rock and a hard place thanks in part to the recent Supreme Court vacancy. Gideon has also spent more than double what Collins has on ads to date with more than $17 million to Collins\\' less than $8 million.\\xa0Read more about battleground ad spending\\xa0here.\\nHEALTH CARE\\nRepublicans incumbents facing tough reelection challenges have taken to the airwaves this week to say they support protecting patients with preexisting conditions even though there is still not comprehensive health care plan to replace the Affordable Care Act if it is repealed, reports\\xa0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson.\\xa0The Affordable Care Act ensures that health insurance providers cannot refuse coverage based on a condition a patient had before the start of their health care coverage, and estimates show that about 54 million people have preexisting conditions. Protecting patients with preexisting conditions has been a top issue on the campaign trail since Mr. Trump led the call for repealing and replacing the ACA upon entering office in 2017. This week, Senator Joni Ernst, facing reelection in Iowa,\\xa0released an ad\\xa0highlighting that her sister has diabetes. \"No one messes with my sister, not bullies or insurance companies,\" Ernst says in the ad. Highlighting a family member who has a preexisting condition is a tactic successful Republican Senate campaigns used in the 2018 midterms. Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley\\xa0released an ad\\xa0sharing that his son has a preexisting condition, and Florida Governor Rick Scott\\xa0recounted\\xa0how a family member had a rare hip disease. Hawley defeated incumbent Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, and Scott beat Democratic Senator Bill Nelson. As attorney general, Hawley joined the Texas lawsuit to overturn the ACA that is now headed to the Supreme Court on November 10, notes\\xa0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice.\\nPENNSYLVANIA\\nSeveral of the House races to watch in Pennsylvania are those taking place in areas that were pivotal to Mr. Trump\\'s upset win in 2016. But in 2018, many of those districts were won by Democrats. And after protests and riots against police brutality, an ongoing fight over mail ballots and a Supreme Court vacancy, the main issue at the top of candidates\\' and constituents\\' minds is still the coronavirus and its economic blowback.\\xa0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\\xa0wrote about three races that overlap with crucial parts of the state to watch election night, such as the 8th district race in the Northeast, a blue collar area which swung dramatically to support Trump in 2016, and the 6th district race in the West Philadelphia suburbs, which have seen a strengthened Democrat base since 2016. But the state\\'s most competitive House race in the 10th district, between Democrat Eugene DePasquale and Republican incumbent Scott Perry, could be a place where Democrats could flip this year-- or at least shave off Trump\\'s margin of victory in the more rural, central parts of the state.\\xa0Read the full story by\\xa0Navarro\\xa0here.\\nOne competitive House races not mentioned in the story is the 17th district race between incumbent Democrat Conor Lamb and Republican Sean Parnell. Just north of Pittsburgh, Mr. Trump was involved early in this race, endorsing Parnell and giving him a speaking slot at August\\'s Republican National Convention. Lamb was one of the first Democrats to pull off the feat of flipping a Trump-won district during a 2018 special election. Since the redistricting, and Lamb\\'s win in the midterms, he\\'s been slightly favored to hold this seat. The Cook Political Report rates this race as \"Lean Democratic.\" Other House competitions to watch in the state include the 7th district election between freshman Democrat Susan Wild and Lisa Scheller, and the 1st district race between Democrat Christina Finello and Republican Brian Fitzpatrick, one of only two House Republicans seeking re-election in a district Hillary Clinton won in 2016.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Athens, Greece\\xa0— A Greek court ruled Wednesday that the far-right Golden Dawn party was operating as a criminal organization, delivering a landmark verdict in a marathon five-year trial. The court delivered guilty verdicts against several of the party\\'s former lawmakers for participating in a criminal organization, and deemed others guilty of leading a criminal organization.\\nThe court convicted a Golden Dawn supporter of the 2013 murder of anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas. Yorgos Roupakias, who had already confessed to participation in the killing, was among the members of a mob that chased Fyssas down and fatally stabbed him. He was accused of delivering the fatal stab wound and now faces a possible life sentence.\\nThe verdicts announced Wednesday are the culmination of a marathon, five-year-long trial against the country\\'s extreme right-wing Golden Dawn party. \\nThere was tight security around the Athens court as more than 15,000 people gathered for an anti-fascist rally outside. When the verdict on Roupakias was announced, crowds both inside and outside the court erupted in raucous cheers. \\nThere were reports that tear gas was fired by police outside as they attempted to control the crowd.  \\xa0 The 68 defendants in the trial include 18 former lawmakers from the party that was founded in the 1980s as a neo-Nazi organization and rose to become Greece\\'s third largest party in parliament during the country\\'s decade-long financial crisis.\\nThe court has been assessing four cases rolled into one: the fatal stabbing of Fyssas, attacks on migrant fishermen, attacks on left-wing activists and whether Golden Dawn was operating as a criminal organization.\\xa0\\nThe presiding judge of the three-member panel began reading the verdicts shortly after 11:30 a.m. local time, quickly delivering the guilty verdict against Roupakias. \\xa0\\nParty leader Nikos Michaloliakos and 17 other former parliamentary members face at least 10 years in prison for leading or participating in a criminal organization. Dozens of others on trial, party members and alleged associates, face convictions on charges that range from murder to perjury — most linked to a spate of violent attacks in 2013.\\nOnly 11 of the 68 defendants were present in the courtroom, with the rest represented by their lawyers. None of the former Golden Dawn lawmakers were in court. \\xa0 About 2,000 police were deployed outside the court, as well as a drone and a police helicopter. The avenue outside the Athens courthouse was closed off to traffic and the building itself blocked off by a string of police buses. \\xa0 The crowd outside waved banners with slogans including \"Fyssas lives, crush the Nazis,\" and chanted \"The people demand the Nazis in jail.\" \\xa0 Representatives of parties across the political spectrum, from the governing conservative New Democracy party to Greece\\'s Communist Party, were outside the courthouse. \\xa0 \"The war against violence and hate is constant,\" said New Democracy\\'s Giorgos Stergiou, noting it was under a New Democracy government that the prosecution of Golden Dawn began. \\xa0 \"Today the victims and society seek justice,\" said center-left Kinal party leader Fofi Gennimata. \"We are here because there is no room for fascism in our lives.\"\\nThe human rights group Amnesty International, which took part in and helped organize a network to record racist violence in Greece, said Wednesday\\'s verdict would boost the efforts of those trying to prosecute hate crimes. \\xa0 \"The accusations against the leaders and members of Golden Dawn, including the murder of Pavlos Fyssas, expose a fissure that exists not just within Greece but across Europe and beyond,\" said Nils Muiznieks, Europe director at Amnesty. \"The impact of this verdict, in what is an emblematic trial of an extreme far-right party with an aggressive anti-migrant and anti-human rights stance, will be felt far beyond Greece\\'s borders.\" \\xa0 Golden Dawn denies any direct link to the attacks and described the trial and charges brought against the party\\'s leadership as an \"unprecedented conspiracy\" aimed at curbing its rise in popularity. \\xa0 \"All supporters await an acquittal tomorrow, a decision that will trigger an even more strident nationalist campaign to take our country back,\" it said Tuesday.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Thousands of asylum-seekers have spent a fourth night sleeping in the open on the Greek island of Lesbos, after successive fires destroyed a notoriously overcrowded migrant and refugee camp during a coronavirus lockdown. \\nOfficials said the Tuesday and Wednesday night blazes were deliberately set by some camp residents angered at quarantine and isolation orders imposed after 35 people in the Moria camp tested positive for COVID-19.  \\nWith the camp gutted, Saturday morning found men, women and children sleeping under improvised shelters made of reed stalks, blankets and salvaged tents. \\nThousands assembled for a protest demanding to be allowed to leave the island.

The camp had long been held up by critics as a symbol of Europe\\'s failings in migration policy.\\xa0\\nMoria was put under a virus lockdown until mid-September after the first case confirmed there was identified in a Somali man who had been granted asylum and left for Athens but later returned to the camp. \\nOn Friday, 200,000 rapid-detection kits for the virus were flown to the island for an extensive testing drive that would include asylum-seekers and islanders. \\nThe World Health Organization said Greece had asked for the deployment of an emergency medical team. Two such teams, one from Belgium and one from Norway, were expected to arrive on Saturday and Monday. \\nAuthorities have said none of the camp\\'s residents – except for 406 unaccompanied teenagers and children – would be allowed to leave the island. The unaccompanied minors were flown to the Greek mainland on Wednesday, and several European countries have said they will take some of them in.  \\nOther countries have pledged assistance for a new camp to be built on Lesbos, a move neither local residents nor the former inhabitants of Moria want. \\nAustrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, whose country has so far not offered to take in children from Moria, underlined his long-time hard line on migration in a video posted on Facebook Saturday. \\n\"Now, some migrants have set alight and destroyed the Moria refugee camp on Lesbos to create pressure so that they can get from Lesbos to the European mainland,\" Kurz said. \"And if we give way to this pressure, we risk making the same mistake as in 2015. We risk people getting up false hopes and setting off for Greece, the smuggling business flourishing and once again countless people drowning in the Mediterranean.\" \\n\"What we want to and will do is help on the spot, so that humane supply and accommodation is ensured, so that people in the whole word can live in bearable conditions,\" Kurz said. \\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'President Donald Trump\\'s defense for admittedly downplaying the risks of the coronavirus is \"disingenuous,\" former Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson told CBSN in an interview Monday. Mr. Trump told journalist Bob Woodward in taped interviews that he did not want to panic the public by leveling with them about the virus in the early months of the pandemic.\\xa0\\nIn early February, Mr. Trump told Woodward that the virus was \"more deadly\" than \"even your strenuous flus\" and that it\\'s difficult to stop because \"it goes through air.\" But publicly, he often said the virus would \"go away\" and on March 19, he told Woodward, \"I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down because I don\\'t want to create a panic.\"\\xa0\\nBut Johnson said Mr. Trump\\'s \"entire campaign strategy\" for reelection this year \"is to create panic and instill fear in the American people.\"\\n\"When he talks about how election night is going to be a disaster, how if Joe Biden is elected, he\\'s going to bring in Cory Booker to\\xa0destroy the suburbs\\xa0— you\\'ll recall, two years ago, during the midterms, he talked about caravans marching toward the southern border from Central America,\" Johnson said.\\n\"To say now that the reason he didn\\'t want to be honest with the American people about the dangers of this virus is because he didn\\'t want to create panic is frankly disingenuous.\"\\nJohnson called the United States\\' response to the pandemic \"tragically disappointing.\"\\n\"The nation with the most powerful public health care apparatus has had the poorest public health care response, and that is due largely to a failure of national leadership from the beginning to tell the American people the truth about the dangers that we face,\" he said.\\xa0\\nSince the pandemic began, more than 194,000 Americans have died.\\nJohnson said that by mid April, the country knew how to combat the virus through social distancing, wearing masks, practicing in good hygiene and staying at home.\\n\"But, tragically, we\\'ve continued to see surges across the country because our national leadership has not been truthful with us about the things we need to do, and has encouraged the American people to let their guard down, get sloppy, go to mass gatherings and the like. And so we are now, as I speak, approaching 200,000 dead here in this country as a result,\" he said.\\xa0\\nJohnson also commented on the Trump administration\\'s policy of turning away asylum-seekers at the border during the pandemic. Under the emergency policy, which the Trump administration says is designed to prevent coronavirus outbreaks, more than 159,000 people, including\\xa0nearly 9,000 unaccompanied children, have been expelled.\\nCalling the policy \"aggressive,\" Johnson warned that it simply encourages people to find another way to cross the border.\\n\"Up until this year, what migrants would do is they cross the border, and they would assume that they would be apprehended by our Border Patrol, and then they\\'d make a case for asylum,\" Johnson said. \"Now, with the implication of this law, we\\'re probably simply just encouraging migrants to avoid capture and get into our country undetected.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Pope Francis says the coronavirus pandemic has proven that the \"magic theories\" of market capitalism have failed. In a new encyclical published Sunday, he wrote that the world needs a new type of politics that promotes dialogue and solidarity and rejects war at all costs.\\xa0\\n\"The marketplace, by itself, cannot resolve every problem,\" he wrote.\\nFrancis laid out his vision for a post-COVID world by uniting the core elements of his social teachings into an encyclical aimed at inspiring a revived sense of the human family. \"Fratelli Tutti\" (Brothers All) was released on the feast day of his namesake, the peace-loving St. Francis of Assisi. The 43,000-word document laments a lack of cooperation between nations during the pandemic, with Francis saying the crisis has exposed \"false securities.\"\\n\"For all our hyper-connectivity, we witnessed a fragmentation that made it more difficult to resolve problems that affect us all,\" he wrote.\\nEncyclical #FratelliTutti https://t.co/c89aZACfGa pic.twitter.com/TRJktiKntO\\nThe document draws its inspiration from the teachings of St. Francis and the pope\\'s previous preaching on the injustices of the global economy and its destruction of the planet and pairs them with his call for greater human solidarity to confront the \"dark clouds over a closed world.\"\\nIn the encyclical, Francis rejected even the Catholic Church\\'s own doctrine justifying war as a means of legitimate defense, saying it had been too broadly applied over the centuries and was no longer viable.\\n\"It is very difficult nowadays to invoke the rational criteria elaborated in earlier centuries to speak of the possibility of a \\'just war,\\'\" Francis wrote in the most controversial new element of the encyclical.\\nFrancis had started writing the encyclical, the third of his pontificate, before the coronavirus struck and its bleak diagnosis of a human family falling apart goes far beyond the problems posed by the outbreak. He said the pandemic, however, had confirmed his belief that current political and economic institutions must be reformed to address the legitimate needs of the people most harmed by the coronavirus.\\n\"Aside from the differing ways that various countries responded to the crisis, their inability to work together became quite evident,\" Francis wrote. \"Anyone who thinks that the only lesson to be learned was the need to improve what we were already doing, or to refine existing systems and regulations, is denying reality.\"\\nHe cited the grave loss of millions of jobs as a result of the virus as evidence of the need for politicians to listen to popular movements, unions and marginalized groups and to craft more just social and economic policies.\\n\"The fragility of world systems in the face of the pandemic has demonstrated that not everything can be resolved by market freedom,\" he wrote. \"It is imperative to have a proactive economic policy directed at \\'promoting an economy that favors productive diversity and business creativity\\' and makes it possible for jobs to be created, and not cut.\"\\nHe denounced populist politics that seek to demonize and isolate, and called for a \"culture of encounter\" that promotes dialogue, solidarity and a sincere effort at working for the common good.\\nAs an outgrowth of that, Francis rejected the concept of an absolute right to property for individuals, stressing instead the \"social purpose\" and common good that must come from sharing the Earth\\'s resources. He repeated his criticism of the \"perverse\" global economic system, which he said consistently keeps the poor on the margins while enriching the few — an argument he made most fully in his 2015 landmark environmental encyclical \"Laudato Sii\" (Praised Be).\\nFrancis also rejected \"trickle-down\" economic theory as he did in the first major mission statement of his papacy, the 2013 Evangelii Gaudium, (The Joy of the Gospel), saying it simply doesn\\'t achieve what it claims.\\n\"Neo-liberalism simply reproduces itself by resorting to magic theories of \\'spillover\\' or \\'trickle\\' — without using the name — as the only solution to societal problems,\" he wrote. \"There is little appreciation of the fact that the alleged \\'spillover\\' does not resolve the inequality that gives rise to new forms of violence threatening the fabric of society.\"\\nFrancis\\' English-language biographer, Austen Ivereigh, said with its two key predecessors, the new encyclical amounts to the final part of a triptych of papal teachings and may well be the last of the pontificate.\\n\"There is little doubt that these three documents ... will be considered the teaching backbone of the Francis era,\" Ivereigh wrote in Commonweal magazine.\\nFrancis made clear the text had wide circulation, printing the encyclical in the Vatican newspaper L\\'Osservatore Romano and distributing it free in St. Peter\\'s Square on Sunday to mark the resumption of printed editions following a hiatus during the COVID-19 lockdown.\\nMuch of the new encyclical repeats Francis\\' well-known preaching about the need to welcome and value migrants and his rejection of the nationalistic, isolationist policies of many of today\\'s political leaders.\\nHe dedicated an entire chapter to the parable of the Good Samaritan, saying its lesson of charity, kindness and looking out for strangers was \"the basic decision we need to make in order to rebuild our wounded world.\"\\n\"That a theme so ancient is spoken with such urgency now is because Pope Francis fears a detachment from the view that we are all really responsible for all, all related to all, all entitled to a just share of what has been given for the good of all,\" said Anna Rowlands, professor of Catholic social thought at Britain\\'s University of Durham, who was on hand to present the encyclical Sunday at the Vatican.\\nFrancis enshrined in the encyclical his previous rejection of both the nuclear arms race and the death penalty, which he said was \"inadmissible\" in all cases.\\nFrancis\\' call for greater \"human fraternity,\" particularly to promote peace, is derived from his 2019 joint appeal with the grand imam of Egypt\\'s Al-Azhar, the revered 1,000-year-old seat of Sunni Islam. Their \"Human Fraternity\" document established the relationship between Catholics and Muslims as brothers, with a common mission to promote peace.\\nThe fact that he has now integrated that Catholic-Muslim document into an encyclical is significant, given Francis\\' conservative critics had already blasted the \"Human Fraternity\" document as heretical, given it stated that God had willed the \"pluralism and diversity of religions.\"\\nVatican encyclicals are the most authoritative form of papal teaching and they traditionally take their titles from the first two words of the document. In this case, \"Fratelli Tutti\" is a quote from the \"Admonitions,\" the guidelines penned by St. Francis in the 13th century.\\nThe title of the encyclical had sparked controversy in the English-speaking world, with critics noting that a straight translation of the word \"fratelli\" (brothers) excludes women. The Vatican has insisted that the plural form of the word \"fratelli\" is gender-inclusive.\\nFrancis\\' decision to sign the document in Assisi, where he travelled on Saturday, and release it on the saint\\'s feast day is yet further evidence of the outsized influence St. Francis has had on the papacy of the Jesuit pope.\\nFrancis is the first pope to name himself after the mendicant friar, who renounced a wealthy, dissolute lifestyle to embrace a life of poverty and service to the poor.\\nQuotes delayed at least 15 minutes.\\nMarket data provided by ICE Data Services.

He chokes on his words and his eyes go red as he lists the few \"cherished items\" he can\\'t leave behind, among them, a photo of his mother and his music, which will remind him of home. \\xa0\\nOver almost a decade of civil war, Syria has become a country of shifting borders, but clear lines: There are lines for bread, lines for gas, lines for sugar and rice. There aren\\'t nearly enough jobs, and power shortages mean routine blackouts.\\nThe war has already driven more than half of Syria\\'s people to flee their homes. More than 5.5 million have fled the country, creating the largest population of refugees in the world. An estimated 6.6 million more have been displaced within Syria\\'s borders, according to the United Nations.\\nWhen the conflict began in 2011, it was relatively easy for people to leave the country. Those without money for a plane ticket poured out in waves of tens of thousands across land borders into Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey. But one by one, those exits have been restricted, or closed off entirely.\\nThis week the government announced that it would reopen Damascus\\' international airport on October 1, with safety measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

Some essentials, including sugar and rice, are being rationed by the government. But even those, along with medicines, are becoming harder and harder to find at all.\\nConditions are so bad that many Syrians — irrespective of age, education or economic status — are still contemplating taking their chances and leaving the country however they can.\\nMuhideen, 36, tells CBS News that a sense of duty to his parents has kept him in Syria for years, giving him \"cold feet\" every time he considered fleeing the country.\\n\"Now even my dad and mom are pushing me to travel and settle with my wife and two sons elsewhere, given the increasingly difficult living conditions and bleak future,\" he said, noting that bakeries across the country are running out of flour and gas stations are running out of fuel.\\xa0\\nSyria\\'s gas crisis is plain to see. Drivers line up for hours every day across the nation, many finally reaching gas stations only to be told the fuel tanks have run dry.\\n\"I woke up at 5 a.m. and went to a nearby station.

The show is one product of a staggering $100 million grant from the MacArthur Foundation.\\nOn the set of \"Ahlan Simsim\" in Amman, Jordan, 60 Minutes Correspondent Lesley Stahl saw firsthand how the Muppets are teaching these coping strategies to children. \"The episode I saw, the tactic was belly breathing,\" Stahl told 60 Minutes Overtime. With the help of three new Muppets--Basma, Jad, and their humorous sidekick baby goat, Ma\\'zooza--created expressly for the Arab-language show, Stahl reported how this new Sesame production will teach children to breathe purposefully when they feel a strong emotion.\\nBasma, the new female Muppet created for \"Welcome Sesame,\" explained belly breathing to Stahl. \"You put your hand on your tummy, then you take a deep breath, and breathe out,\" Basma demonstrated. Experts hope that when children utilize this practice in real life, it will help quell fears and make painful moments more tolerable. As the plush purple Muppet Basma explains, \"This makes you feel relaxed… it helped me feel a little better.\"\\nStahl went on to explain the larger purpose of the exercise. \"You can feel loneliness, you can feel sadness,\" she said, \"you\\'re not alone.\" The deep breaths Basma demonstrated are a reminder to children going through sometimes unimaginable challenges that, in Stahl\\'s words, \"you\\'re not on an island by yourself. We\\'re all in this.\"\\n\"Ahlan Simsim\" made its debut in February 2020, and shows are being broadcast in 20 countries. Sesame has broadcast two specials with Basma and Jad to address kids\\' needs during the Covid-19 pandemic, and season two premiered in late August. Using trained IRC facilitators, \"Ahlan Simsim\" is also reaching children and caregivers through phone calls and digital platforms like WhatsApp while in-person services are interrupted due to the pandemic.\\xa0The video above was originally published on November 17, 2019 and was produced by Sarah Shafer, Rebecca Chertok Gonsalves and Matthew Polevoy.

       "  'body': 'There are more people living as refugees around the world today than at any time since World War II. And with conflicts dragging on for years, being a refugee now often means not going home for decades. That\\'s literally a lifetime for millions of young children.\\nAs we first reported last fall, the refugee crisis has sparked a partnership between two of the country\\'s leading non-profit institutions: Sesame Workshop, creator of \"Sesame Street.\" And the International Rescue Committee, the IRC -- a refugee assistance organization originally founded by Albert Einstein.\\xa0 For 50 years, Sesame Street has been teaching young children that one plus one equals two; but by teaming up with the IRC to help the youngest refugees, it\\'s hoping that one plus one can add up to far more.\\nThis is the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, it houses 77,000 Syrian refugees. This is Azraq camp, it houses another 35,000. It\\'s hard to fathom that these tens of thousands are just a fraction of the more than 6 million Syrians now living as refugees, most of them for the last 4-8 years. And nearly half of all of them are children.\\nLesley Stahl: So this is the big waterhole.\\xa0\\nThe first thing we noticed when we arrived at Azraq camp with our guide Laila Hussein of the IRC, was the kids.\\nLesley Stahl: The little kids carrying the water.\\nLaila Hussein: Yeah.\\nThere\\'s no running water here, no indoor plumbing. Toilets are outside and shared by 6 families. The day we visited it was 111 degrees.\\nLesley Stahl: Ask these young fellows if they come to get water every day.\\xa0[Kids Raise Hands]\\nLaila Hussein: They carry the water.\\xa0\\xa0Lesley Stahl: You carry? How old are you guys? How old?\\nBOY IN ARABIC: Sitte. [Holds Up Six Fingers]\\nLesley Stahl: Six.\\xa0\\n[Next Boy Holds Up Eight Fingers]\\nLesley Stahl: Eight!\\nMeeting the needs of kids like this is not what the humanitarian aid system was set up for.\\nDavid Miliband: The humanitarian sector has prided itself on keeping people alive.\\nDavid Miliband is head of the International Rescue Committee.\\nLesley Stahl: Traditionally I guess that refugees flee war, go home when the war ends.\\nDavid Miliband: Yeah, the theory is that you just keep people alive until they can go home. But we know now that the average length of displacement for a refugee is close to 20 years--\\nLesley Stahl: Twenty years?\\nDavid Miliband: Close to 20 years. And that\\'s why it\\'s a total tragedy that less than 2% of all humanitarian aid funding goes on education, even though half of the world\\'s refugees are kids.\\nAnd only a tiny sliver of that 2% goes to educating young children. \\xa0\\nDavid Miliband: And that\\'s a problem, because we know that it\\'s the earliest years that count the most.\\nNo one knows the importance of those earliest years, and how to reach and teach kids in them, better than \"Sesame Street.\"\\nIt\\'s been using television to educate kids in the U.S., including tackling tough subjects like racism and death, for five decades. And it\\'s done local versions in other countries. In 2016, Sesame Workshop and the IRC had been strategizing about how they could collaborate to help refugee children when a new competition was announced. The prize: a stunning 100 million dollars.\\nDavid Miliband: The MacArthur Foundation offered $100 million to any organization who was ready to, quote-unquote \"solve a big global problem.\"\\nLesley Stahl: A global problem that was intractable.\\nDavid Miliband: We defined the global problem we wanted to tackle was trauma, toxic stress among refugee children in the Middle East.\\xa0\\nIn the final pitch to the competition\\'s judges, Miliband and his Sesame Workshop counterpart Sherrie Westin presented a two-pronged plan: Sesame Workshop would create a new show for the Middle East and the IRC would dramatically expand its services to young refugee kids directly, including where they\\'re living.\\nLesley Stahl: And they gave you $100 million.\\nDavid Miliband: Yeah, $100 million is not as much as it sounds. Because it\\'s--\\nLesley Stahl: It isn\\'t?\\nDavid Miliband: It\\'s over--\\nLesley Stahl: It sounds huge.\\nDavid Miliband: It\\'s over (LAUGH) five years. And we\\'re delivering in-person services to over a million kids and educational content via TV to nearly 8 million kids. So it\\'s a big enterprise.\\nProduction of the new television show, \"Ahlan Simsim,\" meaning \"Welcome Sesame,\" is well underway in Jordan.\\xa0 It stars a spunky purple girl Muppet named Basma, a boy Muppet, Jad, who has just moved into the neighborhood, and their pal and comedic sidekick, a mischievous baby goat.\\nJad isn\\'t labelled a refugee on the show, but there are hints. He\\'s voiced by a Syrian puppeteer and, in this episode, where the other characters are showing each other their favorite childhood toys, Jad can\\'t.\\nJad (Translation): My toy is not with me. I left it behind in my old home when I came here. \\xa0\\nScott Cameron: This was one of the more challenging episodes to craft.\\xa0\\nScott Cameron, a longtime sesame producer who is running this new show, explained that the primary focus is not on letters and numbers, but on emotions like fear, anger, loneliness, and determination. This episode deals with Jad\\'s sadness about his lost toy drum, but also Basma\\'s feelings of caring for her friend.\\nScott Cameron: We want every episode to identify an emotion, but then give really concrete actions so that children can learn what to do.\\nLesley Stahl: So what does she do?\\nScott Cameron: So she decides she\\'s going to make a drum to replace the drum that Jad no longer has--\\nLesley Stahl: It\\'s so sweet.\\nThe show will air in 20 countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and the Gulf starting in February. And if you\\'re wondering how refugees will see it, we were surprised to see that satellite dishes are prevalent in the camps, where the IRC has been ramping up its part of the plan. Direct services to young refugee children, as we saw in this early childhood center the IRC runs in the Azraq camp, where pre-school age kids can come to play and learn. Video clips and storybooks featuring Basma and Jad will soon be part of lessons here. Given these childrens\\' age, Laila Hussein told us it\\'s likely none of them has ever been outside this camp.\\nLaila Hussein: When I meet children in the camp, I notice that they have very limited imagination.\\xa0\\nAnd very limited information.\\nLaila Hussein: I met children. They don\\'t know that the egg coming from a chicken.\\nLesley Stahl: Really?\\xa0\\nLaila Hussein: They don\\'t know that the fish live in the sea. It\\'s our responsibility to bring the world inside the camp. We can\\'t, like, take them out, but we can bring the world inside.\\nAnd bring the world inside their makeshift homes. The IRC runs a home visit program that sends trained volunteers, refugees themselves like this woman, to visit 3,000 refugee families once a week, each time with an age-appropriate educational activity. Here, a home-made picture book for 20-month-old Belal.\\nThe idea is to teach the child and, more importantly, encourage essential one-on-one interactions with the parent. Belal is one of nine children in this family that was driven from their home in Syria by intense shelling and now live, eat, and sleep in two adjoining metal structures -- brutal in the 110+ degree heat.\\nLesley Stahl: So how many years have you been in this camp?\\nFATHER: Hamsni. Five. Hamsni. \\xa0\\nLesley Stahl: Here five years?\\nThe older boys told us they still remember life back in Syria.\\nLesley Stahl: What do you remember?\\xa0\\nOLDEST SON (Translation): I remember our home. I also remember my friends, the school I attended, my grandad\\'s house. \\xa0 \\xa0\\nBut the younger kids only know this life. Their mom told us the home visits have been a huge help as she tries to parent under these conditions.\\nMOTHER (Translation): Before, I didn\\'t give Belal enough praise, because I was always busy with housework, cooking.\\nLesley Stahl: You pay more attention to the children after these visits?\\nMOTHER (Translation): For sure. Even the children with one another, they developed a closer bond. Like if one hands the other a glass of water, the other would go \\'thank you.\\'\\nFATHER (Translation): (LAUGHS) She now forgets to give me attention.\\nLesley Stahl: (LAUGHS)\\nMOTHER (Translation): Not at all. He\\'s getting all the attention.\\xa0\\nLesley Stahl: How would you describe the pressures that these parents are under?\\xa0\\nDavid Miliband: The pressures that these people face are not just the material deprivation.\\nLesley Stahl: Lost everything.\\nDavid Miliband: But the greatest danger they face is hopelessness. These are people who want something if not for themselves anymore, then at least for their children.\\xa0\\nSome of the most vulnerable refugee children are those whose families live outside the refugee camps, in what are called informal tented settlements. Basically tents on the side of the road. Tens of thousands of families live this way, and the IRC is bringing its home visit program to them as well.\\nWe watched as this volunteer worked with year-and-a-half-old Mohamad and his dad, a day laborer on a nearby farm, on the concepts of in and out. Mohamad\\'s mother didn\\'t want to be filmed, but his grandmother was eager to speak with us.\\nTheir smiles and welcome were warm, as was their pride in showing us the home they left behind in Syria. But the pain of living this way for the last five years was never far from the surface.\\nGRANDMOTHER (Translation): Sometimes I am able to hold myself together, but sometimes I can\\'t. I sometimes wish I was in the desert with no one around me to scream out all the negative energy inside of me. \\xa0\\xa0\\nTheir despair was palpable. Which is why one goal of these visits is to help parents keep from passing it on to their young children.\\nLesley Stahl: I see you with your sons. I can tell that you don\\'t want them to feel any of your unhappiness.\\xa0\\nFATHER (Translation): [NODS] You\\'re absolutely right.\\xa0 Even sometimes when I am troubled, and I see them, I smile for them. I want them always to feel happy, and reassured.\\xa0\\nLike the homemade drum Basma gives Jad to replace the one he left behind.\\nThe hope is that the combination of this show, and the array of services along with it, will give these kids a fighting start. Studies to measure the impact are already part of the plan, so if it works...\\nLesley Stahl: You\\'re gonna have this model for refugees around the world.\\nDavid Miliband: There\\'s no reason not to take this to refugee communities from Myanmar who are in Bangladesh, from south Sudan who are in Uganda. Because this is a model that should work for every child who\\'s forced to endure the trauma of being a refugee.\\nLesley Stahl: You know, when people see the footage that we shot, they\\'re not gonna see how hot it was. And they\\'re gonna see children well dressed, obviously fed.\\xa0David Miliband: You\\'re not gonna be able to see the moments of hopelessness.\\xa0 But I hope that by seeing the smiles, you\\'ll see the potential. And you\\'ll come away thinking, \"What a waste not to give these kids every chance and to give more kids the chance of what these kids are getting.\"\\nBasma and Jad made their debut in February, and shows are being broadcast in 20 countries.

There is no standstill.\"\\n\"Women do two thirds of the work in the world, and get a tiny proportion of the reward,\" journalist and women\\'s rights activist\\xa0Gloria Steinem\\xa0tells CBS News in a one-on-one interview Thursday, reflecting on the global summit.\\nSteinem said that the social justice movements — for women\\'s rights, for racial justice, for LGBTQ rights — are all now \"majority concerns\" and there is a pushback in the U.S.: \"So, it is a time in a way, a dangerous time, that we forget to honor, after a victory. You know, we relax, instead of understanding that there is a backlash and we\\'re now in it.\"\\nU.N. Secretary General António Guterres has made gender equality a flagship issue, underscoring the \"relentless pushback against womens rights.\" \\nOpening the summit, he said: \"In some parts of the world, levels of femicide — the killing of women — could be likened to a war zone.\" \\xa0 \\nOn Thursday, the picture Guterres presented was particularly stark: \"Women are still frequently excluded from peace negotiations, climate talks, and decision-making roles of all kinds. Worldwide, women have just 75% of the legal rights of men.\"\\xa0 \\n\"The World Bank estimates that it could take 150 years to achieve gender parity in lifetime earned income,\" Guterres said. \\nThe\\xa0Summit\\xa0included more than 172 speakers, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Mexico\\'s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and French President Emmanuel Macron, in addition to the\\xa0U.N. speakers, led by the executive director of U.N. Women,\\xa0Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka. \\xa0 \\nOf the 149 high-level speakers, 58% were women, according to the spokesman for the president of the General Assembly Brenden Varma said. \\nAt the meeting, Macron announced a forum called Generation Equality to take place in Paris in summer of June 2021. \\nIn one of the most riveting talks in the U.N.\\'s virtual leader-level women\\'s summit at its 75th anniversary General Assembly meeting, Nomzamo Nxumalo Mbatha, a South African actress, human rights activist and U.N. refugee agency\\'s Goodwill Ambassador said, \"The world still has a far long way to go to achieve gender inequality.\" She cited fiindings from\\xa0The Malala Fund\\xa0that say because of COVID-19, half of all refugee girls in secondary schools will\\xa0not\\xa0return when classrooms reopen. \\nIn terms of where to go next, Elizabeth Broderick, chair of a Working Group of the Human Rights Council, said the need is now \"to avert rollback.\" \\nThe U.S. chose to focus on the education of women with U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos this year. And U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft, in an\\xa0interview\\xa0with CBS News, said efforts are being made around the world for women, such as in talks with the Taliban in Afghanistan \"to make certain that we maintain the strides that Afghan women have made,\" such as participation in government. \\xa0 \\nU.N. Women, the agency that coordinates most of the world body\\'s efforts on gender equality, gave a stark overview in its\\xa0report\\xa0for the event: 750 million women and girls alive today were married before their 18th birthday; 400 million women live in extreme poverty; and 243 million women are victims of violence from an intimate partner each year. \\nIt said that \"hard-won advances are being reversed,\" that women currently hold just 25% at the tables of power across the board: Men are still 75% of parliamentarians, hold 73% of managerial positions, are 70% of climate negotiators and almost all of the peacemakers.\\xa0 \\nBut with all the steps back, several women leaders are positive about what needs to be done. Steinem said she does remember when it was worse. \\n\"At the arc of history, as Martin Luther King said, it does move toward justice. But it\\'s up to us to make that happen. So I just hope that we that we don\\'t get a case of the \\'shoulds,\\' you know, \\'what should I do,\\' but rather we do whatever we can every day.\" \\n\"It does depend on what we do and all of our small acts matter,\" she said. \"I think if we have faith that those small acts are important — and we don\\'t despair, looking at the large outrages, but just keep doing everything we can every day, then we\\'ll get there.\"\\xa0 \\nAnd, in a passionate call for progress, the Mbatha said: \"We have a collective responsibility to accelerate global action to realize women\\'s rights and equal future as there can be no equal future without the full and equal participation of all women and girls everywhere.\" \\n\"And this, this is the generation to accomplish that,\" she added. \\n'},\n",

Soldiers used rape as a weapon of war, destroying not only the women they assaulted, but also their families and entire communities. Dr. Denis Mukwege, a gynecological surgeon, operated on and treated thousands of women who had been victims of sexual violence.\\nSix years later, in northern Iraq, Scott Pelley reported how ISIS also used sexual violence as a weapon against women. He spoke with Nadia Murad, a young woman from the Yazidi religious minority, who disguised her face in fear of retribution. She told Pelley that she was forced into sexual slavery by the Islamic state.\\nIn October 2018, Dr. Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize for their work combatting sexual violence as a weapon. \\n\"We want to send out a message of awareness that women, who constitute half of the population in most communities, actually are used as a weapon of war — and that they need protection,\" said Berit Reiss-Andersen, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.\\nWhen Anderson Cooper reported from the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2008, more people had died there in the country\\'s civil war than in Iraq, Afghanistan and Darfur combined. Women were the most frequent targets, and Dr. Denis Mukwege\\'s hospital was the front line.\\nThe hospital was filled with victims of rape, most of them gang-raped. Mukwege told Cooper that soldiers didn\\'t discriminate against their hundreds of thousands of victims; they raped anyone they came across. Mukwege said he treated girls as young as three years old and women as old as 75. \\n\"They\\'re in deep pain,\" Mukwege told Cooper through a translator. \"But it\\'s not just physical pain. It\\'s psychological pain you can see.

       "  'body': 'She wore a scarf in our first interview because she did not want you to know her. She was a humble 21-year-old from a poor farm family. Her dream was to own a hair salon in her village of nearly 2,000, but that was before the massacre. She didn\\'t want to be on 60 Minutes, but she needed the world to know what ISIS did: the murder, the rape, the genocide of her people. Nearly six years ago, in Iraq, we discovered this hesitant, frightened, woman. We did not imagine that her scarf concealed not only her identity, but also a fierce invincibility which would lead her, four years after our interview, to the highest honor the world has to give.\\xa0\\nWe found her here, among refugees who survived the invasion of the ISIS terrorist army. Her people are Yazidis, a minority in northern Iraq that is poor, persecuted and bound by faith to its revered Mount Sinjar. In 2014, ISIS invaded. Two months later, we came to report on the atrocities of the self-described Islamic State.\\nScott Pelley in 2015: Of course, no country on earth recognizes that state, but if it had a border, this would be it.\\nBeyond that border, was the Yazidi homeland where the faithful practice a religion that predates Islam by 3,000 years. In ISIS\\'s perversion of the Muslim faith, the Yazidis were non-believers condemned to slavery and death.\\nNadia Murad (Translation): On Friday, August 15th at 11:30am, they entered our village and told us all to come to the school. There the women and kids were put upstairs and the men downstairs.\\xa0Scott Pelley: What happened to you at that point?\\nNadia Murad (Translation): As we were entering the school, I was with one of my brothers. There, we saw a bulldozer and I asked my brother \"Why is there a bulldozer here?\" He replied, \"To throw dirt on the bodies when they\\'re done killing.\"\\nHer brother was right. The Yazidis, about half a million, were defenseless civilians. Thousands of men, and elder women, were executed. Boys, age seven and older, were forced into the ISIS army.\\xa0\\nScott Pelley: What happened next?\\nNadia Murad (Translation): They started loading up 150 girls in four dump trucks.\\nMore than 3,000 women and girls, as young as nine, were trucked into slavery. She says she was sold and raped, sold and raped again, and then gang raped after a failed escape.\\xa0\\nScott Pelley: What about the other members of your family?\\nNadia Murad (Translation): I have no idea where my brothers are, I want them all to return but most of all I just want my mother! Tell them, \"I just want my mother!\"\\nShe seemed broken. But, as our interview went on, her confidence grew as though she came to realize she wasn\\'t speaking for herself, she was speaking for her people. Months later, she settled in Germany, joined a human rights group, and campaigned for justice. In 2018, the world learned her name because Nadia Murad was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\\nThe 2018 peace prize was meant to expose atrocities women suffer in war. The honor was shared with Denis Mukwege whose hospital treats the sexually assaulted in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\\xa0\\nScott Pelley: I\\'m curious why you chose to speak with us five years ago?\\xa0\\nNadia Murad (Translation): At the beginning, rape was a big shame for me and for others to speak about. Because it would have remained a shame on you, on your family and on your people. The biggest incentive that made me talk was those left behind, including my mother and sisters. I knew what was happening to those in the captivity of ISIS.\\nNadia Murad was captive nine days when the last man who bought her left a door unlocked. Kindhearted strangers smuggled her across the Islamic State line. She became a U.N. human rights ambassador, began learning English, wrote a memoir, and vowed to see ISIS in court. But, for that, she needed a lawyer.\\nAmal Clooney: I met Nadia after a colleague called me and said, \"I have a new case for you.\" And I said, \"No thanks. I\\'m busy.\" And he said, \"There\\'s just an extraordinary young woman I want you to meet. Give me an hour.\"\\xa0\\nIt didn\\'t take an hour for leading human rights attorney, Amal Clooney, to take the case.\\nAmal Clooney: I saw it as a test of the international system. It was so egregious because it involved ISIS, it involved a clear case of genocide. It involved sexual slavery to-- at a scale that we haven\\'t seen in modern times and I thought if the U.N. can\\'t act in this case then what does the international rule of law even mean?\\nBy 2015, not one free Yazidi remained in their homeland. This wasn\\'t just war. By international law, the executions, rape, and kidnapping were war crimes.\\xa0\\nAmal Clooney: This was the same dilemma that the world had after the atrocities of Nazi Germany. And it\\'s the U.S., under President Truman and President Roosevelt that said, \"No, we have to have trials, because there must be a judicial record of the atrocities committed by the Nazis.\" Because today, you do have people denying that there were gas chambers and-- and what do you have to point to? You can go back and say, \"Well, there are 4,000 documents that were submitted as exhibits in the Nuremburg Trials.\" And the Yazidis deserve nothing less than that.\\nAnd there might be similar stacks of evidence of the crimes against the Yazidis, but Clooney feared securing it was a race against time.\\nAmal Clooney: You had mass graves that weren\\'t secured, where the Yazidis knew their relatives were buried and nobody was exhuming them. And also, I noticed that witnesses were becoming more and more reluctant to speak out as time went by. So, you know, there was only so much we could do as a small team of lawyers. And we said, \"This is the responsibility of the U.N. and it\\'s the responsibility of the most powerful body within the U.N., which is the Security Council.\"\\xa0\\nScott Pelley: Had you ever heard of the U.N. Security Council?\\nNadia Murad: Never.\\nIn 2015, just a year after we met her, Nadia Murad asked the security council to hold ISIS accountable.\\xa0\\nNadia Murad (Translation): I\\'ve seen what they\\'ve done to boys and girls, all those who commit the crime of trafficking and genocide need to be brought to justice.\"\\nThe security council voted to approve a first step. In 2017, it created an investigative team to collect evidence of ISIS\\'s crimes in Iraq. The team began exhuming some of the 202 mass graves that are known. Now, the question is, whether the evidence will ever be heard. Iraqi courts are convicting thousands of ISIS suspects of terrorism. But none has been tried for the crime of genocide against the Yazidis.\\xa0\\nSmall pockets of ISIS fighters remain in Syria and Iraq. But U.S. And Iraqi troops have shattered ISIS as a cohesive military force.\\xa0\\nScott Pelley: Is that justice?\\nAmal Clooney: Absolutely not. You know, if you speak to Yazidi witnesses, victims, survivors, they will say, \"It doesn\\'t help me if somebody\\'s killed in a drone strike.\" In terms of justice, that means something very different. That means being able to be in a courtroom and look their abusers in the eye and tell the world what happened. What ISIS did to them. And that hasn\\'t happened yet.\\nIt has happened before in other atrocities. Last year, a U.N.-backed court in Cambodia convicted two former officials of genocide, 40 years after the Khmer Rouge murdered 1.7 million. Beginning in the 1990\\'s, U.N. war crime trials were held for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. But Iraq is not a member of the international criminal court and has not agreed to war crime trials of its own.\\nAmal Clooney: What we would like to see is an openness by the Iraqis to actually have international judges be involved in these trials. Potentially international prosecutors. There are different ways of designing it. You know, the Iraqi government could enter into a treaty with the U.N. or there could be an international court and the Iraqis could agree to transfer those responsible for international crimes to that court.\\nToday, peace, if not justice, has settled into the folds of Mount Sinjar. Four days after accepting the Nobel, Nadia Murad returned with the Yazidi man she would soon marry and two replicas of her peace prize.\\nThis is what the absence of justice looks like. The demands of the desperate focused on a woman, abducted at 21, and now returning bearing the weight of a seven-ounce medal.\\xa0\\nNadia Murad (Translation): The morning that I won the Nobel Prize, I asked my husband, Abid, to see if there was a way I could decline because the prize would make my life difficult. But, fate and God sometimes bring you something so that you can stop crimes and help others.\\xa0\\nScott Pelley: Has the Nobel Prize changed your hopes for the future?\\nNadia Murad (Translation): Now people look at me like I can rebuild Sinjar, that I can bring more help for the victims and that I can take care of the orphans. But, without support, this is not going to happen by just having a Nobel.\\xa0\\nIn her village, she said, \"I have left a Nobel Prize at the Iraqi parliament. I hope Iraq, after 4,000 years, will recognize Yazidis. We have always been second class citizens.\" Later, she walked to a site that held the answer to the desperate question she asked in our first interview. The long, green depression in the earth was a mass grave. Her mother\\'s grave.\\xa0\\nShe said, \"Dear mother, my poor mother.\"\\xa0\\nScott Pelley: You left a replica of your Nobel Peace Prize at your mother\\'s grave.\\nNadia Murad: Yeah.\\nScott Pelley: What do you think she would have thought of that?\\nNadia Murad (Translation): I wonder if she knows that I have talked to the world about her silent death, the killing of her six sons and her two nieces. I often feel that what I have been doing is because of her. I wish that she would know about it she may be happy because the world now knows what ISIS has done.\\nThis is the school where Nadia Murad was separated from her family. Five years later, the murdered and missing are present, but unaccounted for.\\xa0\\nScott Pelley: Altogether, Nadia, how many members of your family were murdered?\\nNadia Murad (Translation): We were 48 brothers, mothers, sisters, nephews and nieces in our family. Nine were killed and three are missing. The rest, who were rescued, now live in refugee camps.\\xa0\\nThere isn\\'t much for refugees to return to. Yazidi homes were wrecked or looted of everything but memories.\\xa0\\nToday, Nadia Murad is navigating without a chart, steering by the constellation of her people\\'s dreams. An accidental leader facing questions she cannot answer. Will they have homes? Will there be justice? It\\'s estimated as many as 5,000 Yazidis were murdered, 6,000 abducted. Nearly 4,000 are missing still. With no international trials scheduled for these crimes, evidence from mass graves is being entombed in Baghdad where it will wait until the world that hears her voice, shares her courage.\\xa0\\nClick here for more information on Nadia Murad\\'s foundation, \"Nadia\\'s Initiative\"\\nProduced by Rachael Morehouse.

       "  'body': 'Amman, Jordan —\\xa0The coronavirus has crept into one of the biggest camps for Syrian refugees. One refugee and two Jordanian workers at the Zaatari camp have tested positive for COVID-19, the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR confirmed Thursday.\\nThe agency said the infected workers were not UNHCR staff. Both were workers at a clinic in the camp.\\n\"It was a surprise for us,\" UNHCR representative Mohammed Al-Taher told CBS News, given the great efforts exerted on the ground at the Jordanian camp to avoid infections, including temperature checks for anyone entering and vehicle sterilization. \"We are worried about the refugees. We need just to keep the camp very clean, and clear of COVID-19.\"\\xa0\\nHis concern is warranted. Less than 10 miles from the Syrian border, the Zaatari camp is home to nearly 77,000 Syrian refugees who fled the grinding, nearly decade-long war in their country. The sprawling settlement of small white trailers in the desert has become an iconic symbol of the plight of Syria\\'s displaced people.\\n\"We are talking about almost 77,000 refugees who live in an area of 5.3 square kilometers (2 square miles), which is really very dense, very crowded,\" said Al-Taher. Those conditions make it challenging for UNHCR to prevent the spread of the virus in the camp, but it has intensified its awareness campaign, urging refugees to take precautions.\\nKnowing the risks at the camp, given the close quarters and challenges with sanitation in a tent city, the refugees and administrators at Zaatari have been on high alert since the pandemic started.\\xa0\\n\"Most people have stopped going out unless it is absolutely necessary,\" refugee Ahmad Harb, 35, was quoted as saying in a UNHCR press release. \"They are staying at home all day and night. Some have even put signs outside their doors that read \\'visits not allowed.\\'\"\\nDozens of local and international aid groups work inside the camp, employing hundreds of Jordanians and international staffers.\\xa0\\nAccording to al-Taher, the virus was brought into the camp by a Jordanian physiotherapist with the Arabian Medical Rescue organization, who worked at a clinic in Zaatari. The physiotherapist is believed to have infected both the other aid worker at the clinic and the refugee who has tested positive.\\nJordan has fought the spread of COVID-19 with relative success. Strict lockdown measures were imposed early on, helping to keep the number of infections low. New daily confirmed cases even fell to zero in July.\\xa0\\nHowever, a few lapses at border crossings and the easing of lockdown measures have seen the number of new cases spike in recent weeks, and the disease is once again spreading around the kingdom. To date, Jordan has confirmed almost 2,800 coronavirus cases, and 20 deaths.\\xa0\\nMany of those who work in the camp watched the resurgence of COVID-19 in Jordan, outside of Zaatari, with trepidation.\\xa0\\n\"The camp, in a way, is not isolated from what\\'s happening in the neighboring governorates and cities,\" said Qasim Adeeb Qasim, site manager for the international aid group Oxfam.\\nTo ensure the continuity of Oxfam\\'s work, Qassim said that as of Sunday his 45-person team at Zaatari would divide into two groups, working on different days to help ensure social distancing and minimize contact risks.\\xa0\\n\"All agencies working in Zaatari must be able to control the safety of their staff, and at the same time the safety of the people we serve,\" he told CBS News.\\nUNHCR said its team at the camp was following the Jordanian Ministry of Health\\'s established anti-virus protocols. The three confirmed cases have been isolated away from other camp residents and staff. The agency has also managed to trace, isolate, and test people known to have come into contact with the virus patients. COVID-19 test results were pending for those individuals, and UNHCR was closely monitoring the situation.\\xa0\\nThe national Health Ministry is in charge of coronavirus testing at the camp, and it has been carrying out random tests of refugees there for weeks, in addition to the targeted testing of close contacts of known cases.\\n\"We are just praying, and we hope that all the cases on the random tests done in Zaatari camp will be negative and hopefully we will keep our refugees very clear and away from COVID-19,\" the UNHCR spokesman told CBS News.\\xa0\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Damascus\\xa0— At the end of August, Syrian President Bashar Assad reshuffled his cabinet, bringing in some new names to try to fix an economy ravaged by almost a decade of civil war and the coronavirus pandemic. \\nBut as new research from London makes clear, getting a grip on the COVID-19 epidemic in Syria — even grasping the scale of it — will be a big challenge for the reshaped government as it tries to wind down the war that has claimed more than 500,000 lives and rebuild the economy.\\nSyria\\'s government has officially confirmed only 2,703 coronavirus cases and 109 deaths in the territory it controls since the pandemic began. There are no reliable figures for the small portion of the country held by rebel groups, or the significant swathe of northeast Syria controlled by Kurdish forces. \\xa0\\nAccording to the official statistics, the country\\'s caseload, both in total numbers and per capita, hovers near the bottom of global rankings. But medics and residents say the real numbers are likely to be much higher.\\nAn official at one mortuary in Damascus told CBS News that he estimated at least 100 patients were dying of COVID-19 every day in the capital alone. \\nIn a study published on September 15, researchers from Imperial College London\\'s COVID-19 Response Team, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Syria team at the London School of Economics, Google, the European Institute of Peace and the Middle East Institute estimated that only 1.25% of the actual coronavirus deaths in Damascus were being counted.\\nThe Imperial College study states that \"an estimated 4,380 [95% of] deaths due to COVID-19 in Damascus may have been missed as of the 2nd September 2020. Given that Damascus is likely to have the most robust surveillance in Syria, these findings suggest that other regions of the country could have experienced similar or worse mortality rates due to COVID-19.\"\\xa0\\xa0\\nEven the official number of cases recorded daily tripled between the beginning of July and the end of August. The government reported 70-80 new cases every day for about a week — much higher than the single-digit increases that had been the norm since the virus was first detected in Syria in March.\\nA handful of high-profile cases have come to light in recent days, hinting at the true scale of the crisis.\\nLast week, negotiations on a new Syrian constitution aimed at ending the civil war barely got off the ground in Geneva before being abruptly halted because four of the 23 members of the official Syrian delegation tested positive for the virus after arriving.\\nSeven players on the national soccer team have tested positive, according to the Syrian Sports Federation, and regular Syrians have shared scores of obituaries for relatives and friends lost to the virus on social media. \\nA popular Facebook group for Syrian lawyers said it had lost 31 attorneys to the virus in the past month alone. \\nDr. Nihad Assaf, a surgeon at the prestigious Saint Louis French hospital in Syria\\'s capital, told CBS News the coronavirus killed 63 physicians across the country in just one month.\\xa0\\nIt was a loss the country could ill-afford: Syria\\'s health infrastructure was already crippled by the civil war when the pandemic struck, with hospitals damaged by bombings, vital equipment in short supply and many doctors hurt, killed or forced to flee due to fighting.\\xa0 \\nNabog al-Awa, the dean of the medical faculty at the University of Damascus, told CBS News that 100 coronavirus patients were arriving at the capital\\'s hospitals daily, but he warned there were likely many more new infections going undetected, as only the sickest people show up to hospitals.\\xa0\\nEven those who come to emergency rooms may find little help. \\n\"Many people are going to state-run hospitals, but unfortunately all the rooms are full,\" said al-Awa. \"Patients in a bad state are not admitted to the intensive care unit unless another patient dies.\"\\nWith that backdrop, many Syrians have gone online for medical advice. Facebook pages followed by tens of thousands of people, until recently dedicated to keeping users apprised of where shells were falling, have redirected their attention to the new, invisible threat.\\nWith names like \"Sterilize It!\" and \"Syrian Health Platform,\" the pages publish the latest developments on the coronavirus and its spread around the world.\\nThe government has now bolstered efforts to raise awareness about the virus and track its spread, emphasizing the importance of social distancing and wearing masks and gloves. \\nThere are now four laboratories set up in government-held areas to process coronavirus tests, and a website has been established to monitor cases across the country.\\xa0 \\nNizar Yaziji, until recently the Syrian Health Minister, has said Western and U.S. sanctions against the government, not the war, had thwarted the country\\'s response. A new wave of U.S. sanctions against Syria that came into force in June, known as the Caesar Act, have prompted fears of even deeper economic turmoil.\\nThe Syrian government has also lost a huge amount of revenue over the last decade. Many of its lucrative gas and oil fields are now under the control of U.S.-backed fighters, along with farmland that used to produce much of the country\\'s domestic wheat supply. Bread prices have shot up almost 60% in recent years.\\nBut the lack of financial resources hasn\\'t been the only factor. Syria also adopted anti-coronavirus measures later than most other countries in the region, and started lifting them sooner. \\nSyrian business and industry leaders have long warned that a total economic meltdown would claim far more victims than COVID-19, and the government listened.\\nPresident Assad imposed a lockdown for just two months, until late May, banning intercity travel and ordering a nigh-time curfew. But many videos from that period showed people in crowded markets, without a mask in sight.\\nThe quick reopening may have kept the beleaguered economy limping along, but it also may have contributed to the continuing rise in coronavirus infections — the real scale of which remains a mystery.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday the U.S. Census Bureau can conclude its 2020 count early, giving it enough time to finish with enough time to process the data before year end. The decision, which the Trump administration favored, came with a candid dissent from Justice Sonia Sotomayor. \\xa0\\n\"Meeting the deadline at the expense of the accuracy of the census is not a cost worth paying,\" Sotomayor wrote in her\\xa0dissent. \"Especially when the Government has failed to show why it could not bear the lesser cost of expending more resources to meet the deadline or continuing its prior efforts to seek an extension from Congress. This Court normally does not grant extraordinary relief on such a painfully disproportionate balance of harms.\"\\nHours after the Supreme Court released its ruling, the bureau\\xa0announced\\xa0it would accept responses and end door knocking on October 15. \"As of today, well over 99.9% of housing units have been accounted for in the 2020 Census. Self-response and field data collection operations for the 2020 Census will conclude on October 15, 2020.\"\\n\"Internet self-response,\" which can be accessed at\\xa02020Census.gov, \"will be available across the nation through October 15, 2020 through 11:59 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time (HST), (through 5:59 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on October 16, 2020),\" according to the bureau. Paper responses also must be postmarked by October 15.\\nThe U.S. Census Bureau, which is overseen by Trump appointee Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, announced in an\\xa0August 3 press release\\xa0that it would be ending its count by September 30 — a month before it originally planned. The Trump administration argued it needed to end then to crunch the data before the congressionally-mandated deadline of December 31, 2020.\\xa0\\nIn-person data collection, a hallmark of the Census, was forced to pause in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The temporary suspension prompted the Census Bureau to initially request an extension for the count. \"To ensure the completeness and accuracy of the 2020 Census, the Census Bureau is seeking statutory relief from Congress of 120 additional calendar days to deliver final apportionment counts,\" read an April\\xa0press release\\xa0from the bureau.\\nThe administration later changed course, announcing on August 3 that it would instead be speeding up the count to meet its statutory deadline of December 31, 2020. However, this so-called \"replan\" came just weeks after President Trump announced\\xa0plans\\xa0to\\xa0exclude undocumented immigrants from the count\\xa0— and representation in Congress — prompting several advocacy groups to sue to block the accelerated count.\\xa0\\nExcluding undocumented immigrants could have potentially seismic political ramifications. According to\\xa0an estimate\\xa0by the Pew Research Center, if unauthorized immigrants aren\\'t counted, California, Texas and Florida would get fewer seats than expected in the House of Representatives; while Alabama, Minnesota and Ohio, would keep seats they would otherwise have lost.\\nThat replan was challenged before arriving at the Supreme Court. A federal judge in California ruled in September that the administration\\'s plan would not remedy COVID-19 delays, and instead would result in an inaccurate count that could cause \"irreparable harm.\" The Trump administration was ordered to continue its count through October, temporarily abandoning plans to end the count ahead of schedule.\\nThat ruling, however, was only a\\xa0preliminary injunction\\xa0to the Trump administration\\'s \"stated reason for the August 3, 2020 Replan.\" In response, the administration filed an emergency request asking the Supreme Court to allow the bureau to wrap up field operations, arguing that the process needed to end in order to deliver results to the president by the end of the year.\\xa0\\nThe court granted that request on Tuesday, \"pending disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and disposition of the petition for a writ of certiorari, if such writ is timely sought.\"\\nThe justices did not explain their order, which is typical for emergency applications. No other justice signed on to Sotomayor\\'s dissent.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'With just over 20 days to go until the election, Joe Biden and President Donald Trump are revving up the number of ads airing on TV. Biden continues to outspend the president on ads according to the latest tracking by Kantar/CMAG, a trend that has been playing out since the end of July with the former vice president outspending the president in some cases two to one on TV ads over the past few weeks.\\nCBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\\xa0reports President Trump is currently spending more than $17 million on TV ads in 11 states this week. At the same time, Joe Biden is currently spending more than $24 million in 16 states. Just yesterday, Kantar/CMAG tracking also showed the Trump campaign cut more than $10M in TV ad reservations in 9 states while adding some spending in just 3 states.\\nBiden\\'s ads have been focused on his plans regarding the economy and combatting COVID-19. On Tuesday a new ad aired taking aim at the president, directly mentioning his testing positive for COVID-19.\\n\"He was warned but ignored the evidence, holding rallies indoors, turning the White House into a super spreader and contracting the virus himself,\" says the narrator. \"Now he claims he\\'s learned about COVID-19...But he hasn\\'t learned a thing,\" it continues. At the same time, President Trump is also now running an ad on coronavirus and how he\\'s recovering. It aired for the first time Saturday, the same day he had his White House event. In the ad he says they will live \"carefully.\"\\nThis past week, the Biden campaign has also started airing ads featuring Samuel L. Jackson and Cindy McCain while both Biden and Mr. Trump are taking aim at each other over Medicare and Social Security, a clear play toward seniors. Both candidates have also touted criminal justice plans. The president\\'s latest ads have continued to include warnings about law and order and the \"radical left\\'s\" plans. Images of Sen. Bernie Sanders have appeared numerous times in ads taking aim at Biden. In the president\\'s latest TV ad to air Tuesday for the first time according to tracking, the My Pillow guy and Trump supporter Mike Lindell holds a roundtable with voters of \"both parties\" where they take aim at Biden.\\nTonight, President Trump heads to Johnstown, PA where he is expected to deliver remarks targeting democratic opponent Joe Biden during an airport hangar rally -- his second since contracting COVID-19, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga.\\nAccording to released excerpts from the campaign, President Trump is expected to say, \"For half a century, Biden twisted his blade into the heart of American Workers. He should not be asking for your votes, he should be begging for your forgiveness.\" The incendiary remark follows a call for civility today from Utah Republican Senator Mitt Romney, who condemned the \"vile\" and \"vituperative\" nature of American politics, blaming President Donald Trump in large part. Mr. Trump will also call Joe Biden a \"servant of the radical globalists, wealthy donors, and special interests,\" who shipped away American jobs, according to his prepared remarks. Under 8 years of the Obama administration, the economy gained a net 11.6 million jobs. Average weekly earnings for all workers were increased by 4.2% accounting for inflation. The President, campaigning for the second day in a row in a battleground state, will also attack Biden for his stance on fracking, law enforcement, and climate change.\\nCBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\\xa0reports that Cambria County, where Johnstown is, was once reliably Democratic, but has gone to a Republican presidential candidate in three of the last four elections.\\nIn 2016, Mr. Trump grew the Republican lead there from 18 to 27 points. It\\'s surrounded on all sides by now reliably Republican counties, each of which Trump won in 2016 with at least 65% of the vote. Over 5,000 showed up for the Johnstown event, according to a Fire Department estimate. The majority of audience members were not wearing masks, and attendees with whom CBS spoke overwhelmingly said they had no concerns about catching the virus at this close-quarters outdoor event where the campaign administered temperature checks at the entrance.\\n\"I take precautions if I\\'m in a crowded place indoors. But [today], the air\\'s going to blow everything away,\" said Kathy Nagle of nearby Blair County. \"I view it this way: If God wants me to get it, I\\'m going to get it,\" said Edward Young, who travelled to the event, his 41st Trump rally, from Brick, NJ. Young, who voted for Obama twice before Trump, said he sees Trump as a \"superhero,\" and that the president\\'s COVID recovery cemented that status. \"The great plague that has leveled our country, a 74-year-old man gets over it in four days and now he\\'s doing just fine,\" he said. \"He\\'s back doing rallies. It\\'s like what Nietzsche said. That which does not destroy him makes him stronger.\"\\nEarlier today, the Trump campaign announced that Vice President Pence will return to Florida on Thursday after he held an event there on Saturday.\\nMeanwhile, President Trump is also going to make a return trip to the Sunshine State on Friday after having campaigned there yesterday. That\\'s four trips from the Republican ticket to Florida in less than a week, according to\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar.\\nPence campaigned in Wisconsin on Tuesday where he touted the Trump administration\\'s record on trade. Pence said he was in the room when President Trump negotiated the US-Mexico-Canada trade deal and claimed that the USMCA is a much better deal for Wisconsin workers. Pence also attacked Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on other topics like law enforcement, climate change, and abortion.\\n\"If you cherish faith and freedom and law and order and life, three weeks from today you need to do everything in your power to work, to voice, to vote to reelect President Trump for four more years,\" Pence said in Wisconsin.\\nPence said Biden and Harris don\\'t want to answer the question on court packing because they want to add liberal judges to the court. \"We might have been born in the morning but we weren\\'t born yesterday morning,\" Pence said. \"I mean, the only explanation about why they aren\\'t answering the question is because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are planning to pack the court with liberal judges if they win this election, but we\\'re not gonna let it happen,\" Pence added.\\nLast night during a local interview with WKRC in Cincinnati, Biden did say he\\'s \"not a fan of court packing.\" The Trump campaign also launched a new TV ad today to highlight the President\\'s achievements for American seniors. The ad is part of this week\\'s 8-figure buy and will run on national cable and specific local markets in Wisconsin, Florida, Pennsylvania, Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Maine, Minnesota and Nevada.\\nPresident Trump\\'s son Donald Trump Jr. is set to return Wednesday to Arizona and Nevada, the latest Trump campaign surrogate to stump through the two states rallying the president\\'s supporters.\\n\"My only disappointment is not being able to stay longer. But my father has me working quite hard these days,\" President Trump\\'s daughter Ivanka Trump\\xa0said Monday, capping her own swing through the two Western states with an outdoor event in Southern Nevada, says\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin.\\nPresident Trump himself had been scheduled to headline Arizona rallies in Tucson and Flagstaff in early October, before the events were cancelled over his COVID-19 diagnosis. His campaign has not announced any new visits to the battleground state as he returns to the campaign trail, though the president did phone in over the weekend to Arizona to rally supporters\\xa0in a \"tele-rally.\"\\nFormer Vice President Biden appeared at a drive-in event in Miramar, Florida Tuesday evening which is part of Broward County, reports\\xa0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice.\\nBecause this was a drive-in event, instead of applause, viewers got to hear car horns where pauses were taken for applause. Biden had a lot of energy as he walked up without a mask (the podium was wiped down), but he did put a mask right back on after his remarks.\\nDuring a fired-up speech, the former vice president was practically shouting at times. Biden continued to slam Trump for his coronavirus response and downplaying the virus saying \"the American people do not panic. Donald Trump panicked,\" and claiming, \"three more weeks until we end this madness.\"\\nWhile Biden has long been criticizing Mr. Trump for his response, today he also took aim at the Trump campaign ad \"Carefully\" that quotes Dr. Anthony Fauci.\\n\"The most respected doc in the country on this issue is Dr. Fauci. He referred to the president\\'s announcement of the Supreme Court, at a political event in the Rose Garden, or in the backyard of the White House, he called it a \\'super spreading event.\\' Look at all the people who became contagious and got ill,\" said Biden. \"And how is he responding now - he, Trump, is running a national ad on television, you may have seen it, taking...Dr. Fauci out of context.\"\\nBiden also took aim at racial injustice during his speech but called for law enforcement to be able to do their jobs without \"extremists and vigilantes.\"\\nHe did not spend much time on the Supreme Court hearing but did slam the hearing in regards to the ACA. \"We\\'ve got to protect your health care,\" he said. \"In the middle of this pandemic, why do the Republicans have time to hold a hearing to pack the court instead of providing economic relief... for localities? I\\'ll tell you why. It\\'s about, it\\'s about wiping out the Affordable Care Act, wipe it off the books. Because their nominee said in the past that the law should be struck down. That will take away health care for 20 million Americans.\"\\nAt the very beginning of his speech, Biden called it \"Go time,\" and noted \"We win Florida and it\\'s all over.\" At numerous times he reminded his audience to make sure they vote, by mail, by drop-box, or in person.\\nAt his first campaign event earlier in the day, Biden appealed directly to the older community members in Pembroke Pines, Florida talking about Social Security, Medicaid and President Trump\\'s temperament as it relates to the pandemic.\\n\"To Donald Trump it\\'s simple. Not a joke. You\\'re expendable. You\\'re forgettable. You\\'re virtually nobody. That\\'s how he sees seniors. That\\'s how he sees you,\" Biden said, referencing comments the president made at a rally saying the\\xa0virus affects \"virtually nobody.\"\\nCBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\\xa0says Biden also mentioned how he had prayed for Trump\\'s recovery from COVID-19, but said \"his reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis is unconscionable\" and that \"the longer Donald Trump is president the more reckless he seems to get. Thank god we only have three weeks left to go.\"\\nThe former VP was particularly fiery when talking about Trump\\'s \\'losers\\' and \\'suckers\\' comments about the military, as well as his acknowledgement to journalist Bob Woodward about how dangerous the virus is. \"He knew it was a dangerous and highly communicable disease. But he did nothing. He didn\\'t do a thing. He didn\\'t tell you! He didn\\'t tell any American!\" Biden said.\\nFlorida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who said she supported Biden\\'s 1988 presidential run while in college, introduced him Tuesday and made note of the power of the senior vote in Florida.\\nWhen Donald Trump, Jr. visited Fayetteville, N.C. on Saturday, it was on the heels of a visit his father had made to the city just three weeks prior, and it was an appeal -- at least in part -- to the military veterans in the area. The stop also came just days after former Second Lady Jill Biden also visited Fayetteville, the county seat of Cumberland County, to speak with veterans and military families.\\nDr. Ngozi Kamalu, a political science professor at Fayetteville State University, told\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\\xa0that Cumberland County, the 5th largest county in the battleground state of North Carolina, is politically significant for a variety of reasons, including being one of four North Carolina counties in which the Fort Bragg U.S. Army military base is located. With nearly 57,000 military personnel and 11,000 civilian employees, Fort Bragg is one of the largest military complexes in the world according to the U.S. Army\\xa0website.\\n\"Home of the Airborne and Special Operations Forces,\" Prof. Kamalu noted that the diversity of the military population of Fort Bragg \"reverberates\" throughout the county. \"For anybody who wants to win the military vote, Fort Bragg is one of the places you need to win and Cumberland County is just very contiguous to it,\" said Prof. Kamalu, who added that it\\'s going to be \"very hard\" for a candidate to win the state without winning Cumberland County.\\nHowever, Prof. Kamalu conceded that while North Carolina may be a toss-up state, Fayetteville\\'s Democratic mayor, the composition of the city council, and the county\\'s expanding racial diversity may make it an area that Democrats could win again. Still other political scientists believe Republicans like Mr. Trump could have a fair shot at winning over some of the county\\'s 221,658 registered voters. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won Cumberland County, capturing 56% of the more than 127,506 votes cast in the county.\\nPresident Trump received 40% of the vote with just over 51,000 votes. In 2012, President Barack Obama beat out Republican challenger Mitt Romney by a slightly larger margin of 19.69%, winning 59% of the 127,641 votes cast in that presidential election.\\nIn the latest edition of CBS News COVID Chronicles\\xa0campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\\xa0explored how Florida educators are continuing to address the digital divide that has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.\\nWhen CBS News first\\xa0spoke\\xa0with Leon County Schools Superintendent Rocky Hannah in July, the county had made an $11 million investment to purchase more than 32,000 laptops that his team planned to distribute to every student in the school district before the school year started. But due to back orders, the laptops did not arrive before classes began in August, so the county instead distributed 9,000 desktops to students who opted to work remotely.\\nAs of this week, the shipment of laptops have started to arrive and Hannah\\'s team plans to run a pilot program with three schools, where they will distribute laptops to the students at an elementary, middle and K-8 school before passing out to the other students in the district. And while Leon County Schools and partner organizations like the South City Foundation continue to look for ways to expand technological access and support to students, Hannah contends that the pandemic is far from over. \"Let\\'s be clear: this pandemic is not over and it\\'s not going anywhere in the near future,\" said Hannah. \"We\\'re going to continue to monitor and work with our families daily and meet them again where they\\'re comfortable.\" Read the full story\\xa0here.\\nFormer President Obama is urging Americans to make a plan to vote. In a new Democratic National Committee video, the former president walks voters through a tutorial on options, including vote by mail, early voting in-person and voting on Election Day, reports\\xa0CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion.\\n\"So much is at stake in this election -- from getting the pandemic under control to building a fairer economy to taking on climate change to protecting our health care,\" Mr. Obama says in the opening seconds. \"And when it comes to voting this year, having a plan has never been more important.\"\\nThe ad series, released Tuesday, includes specific voting instructions for 24 states. Obama also promotes the website, IWillVote.com, which allows voters to request and return ballots by mail and learn more about the voting process. His wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, is also trying to build momentum around early voting. Her non-partisan organization, When We All Vote, announced a new partnership with Lebron James\\' group, More Than A Vote.\\nBoth entities will launch two weeks of action from October 18-31, dubbed \"When We All Vote Together.\" Mrs. Obama said, \"Millions of Americans have already cast their ballots and with only 21 days until Election Day, making your plan to vote early is critical. It\\'s now up to us to do everything in our power to get our friends and family ready to vote early and safely together.\"\\nThe groups will provide over $1 million in grants to local organizations that host voter activation events. They will also provide transportation, personal protective equipment (PPE) and offer voter protection support to individuals who live near early voting sites. In-person events are slated in Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee, Los Angeles, Orlando and other cities. Additional partners include Black Entertainment Television, Comedy Central and MTV, which are divisions of ViacomCBS.\\nIn an unsigned order, the Supreme Court granted the Trump Administration\\'s request to stop the census count immediately, instead of allowing the count to go until October 31, reports\\xa0CBS News chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford.\\nBecause of the coronavirus, the government had extended the original deadline for responses to the census questionnaire from July 31 to October 31. But in early August, it changed the deadlines again, announcing it would stop the counting on September 30 - leading to a dispute over another month of counting.\\nWhen the Census Bureau announced the original extension back in April, it also sought to extend the deadline for sending the count to the President for apportionment from Dec. 31 (as required under the Census Act) to April 30, 2021. Apportionment is when the latest Census data is used to allocate how many Congressional district each state gets. But in early August, before Congress could agree to extend the reporting deadline, the government switched course (a \"Replan\") and said it would end data collection on Sept. 30, with a report to the President on Dec. 31.\\nThe administration said it needed to end the counting to be able to get the report to the President, as required by law. But that also happened to be a couple weeks after President Trump announced he would seek to exclude undocumented immigrants from being counted for congressional apportionment. Several advocacy groups then sued to block the \"Replan,\" arguing it would\\xa0result in a heavy undercount. A district court agreed to reinstate the original extensions. The appeals court split the difference and reinstated the Oct. 31 collection deadline while allowing the Dec. 31 reporting deadline to the President. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the dissent and said, \"the harms associated with an inaccurate census are avoidable and intolerable.\"\\nOfficials in Arizona\\'s most populous county say they expect to have much of their ballots counted and ready to report by November 3rd, thanks to upgraded equipment and a new state law allowing counties to begin tabulating results two weeks ahead of Election Day, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin.\\n\"It\\'s our goal to include nearly all ballots returned to the Elections Department by the end of the month in the first 8 p.m. results report on Election Night,\" Megan Gilbertson, communications director for the Maricopa County Elections Department, said in an email.\\nMore than 80% of votes cast by Arizonans in 2018 were returned early in-person or by mail, according\\xa0to federal data. And, amid the coronavirus pandemic, both campaigns have urged their Arizona supporters to cast their ballots early or by mail this cycle, with Joe Biden\\'s team repeatedly touting its\\xa0\"first week voter\"\\xa0efforts in the state.\\nThe California Republican Party said it has no plans to remove ballot collection boxes\\xa0after state officials called them illegal yesterday\\xa0and ordered Republicans to take them down immediately. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla and Attorney General Xavier Becerra issued a cease and desist order yesterday and threatened further legal action if the state party doesn\\'t remove ballot collection boxes that appeared in Los Angeles County, Orange County, and Fresno County over the weekend.\\n\"When we got the cease and desist order yesterday, we were trying to go through it and trying to figure out what election code we\\'re actually violating,\" CA GOP spokesman Hector Bajaras told\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar.\\nBarajas added that the boxes are legal and within the scope of the law. He said that his party\\'s ballot harvesting operation is no different than Democrats collecting ballots at union halls.\\nThe controversy over the ballot boxes flared up over the weekend when a regional field director with the California Republican Party in Orange County tweeted a photo of himself holding a vote-by-mail ballot, standing next to a black cabinet with a taped sign that read \"official ballot drop off box.\" The staffer, Jordan Tygh, encouraged voters to message him for \"convenient locations\" to drop off their ballots. Barajas acknowledged mistakes were made with how signage on the ballot boxes and said the wording on them was fixed on Sunday.\\n\"We\\'ll eat some crow here. We could\\'ve used better wording on it and we made that correction on Monday,\" Barajas said. The GOP spokesman said staffers are assigned to collect ballots from those boxes every three days, in accordance with the law, and the ones that were collected over the weekend have been turned into the local counties.\\nOne of several options California voters have to return their mail-in ballot is choosing someone they trust to drop the completed ballot at a county elections office. In 2016, the law was expanded to allow volunteers, campaign operatives, and private organizations, in addition to close family members, to return a ballot. The ballot must be signed by both the voter and the person collecting it and dropped off at a local election office within 72 hours.\\nBarajas argued that state assembly bill 306, signed into law in 2018, does not disqualify a ballot solely because a person returning it did not provide on the identification envelope his or her name and relationship to the voter or a signature.\\n\"We want to make sure that the California secretary of state can catch up to the laws on voting and dealing with ballots as opposed to continuing to go out there and give some untruths,\" Barajas said.\\nPadilla\\'s deadline for the California Republican Party to remove the ballot collection boxes is for Thursday but Barajas said they\\'re pushing ahead and even looking to add more boxes.\\n\"We\\'ve gotten requests for more (boxes) and so you know we\\'re going to look and maybe we\\'ll double or triple our efforts,\" Barajas said.\\nNearly one million Michiganders have voted in the general election, according to\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster.\\xa0As of Monday morning, 977,694 people had returned their absentee ballots in Michigan, the Michigan Secretary of State\\'s office told reporters on Tuesday. 2.85 million Michiganders have requested absentee ballots for the election, meaning a little over a third of requested ballots have been returned. At the same point in 2016, about 916,000 people had requested absentee ballots and nearly a quarter million had returned them.\\nMichigan voters passed a constitutional amendment in 2018 to allow for no-excuse absentee voting. In August, a record 1.6 million people voted absentee in Michigan.\\nMichigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson has projected 3 million people or more may vote absentee during the general election.\\nNEVADA\\nNevada Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske confirmed reports of misprints in two rural counties\\xa0in a statement late Monday, after a\\xa0local NBC station\\xa0said some voters were confused by an error on materials for their mail ballots, according to\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin.\\nIn one county, return envelopes had asked voters to sign \"under penalty of perjury\" that they were registered voters of a different county in the state hours away. Nevada, which this year mailed ballots to all voters due to the coronavirus pandemic, had faced an earlier snafu over the all-mail contest: several of the state\\'s counties postponed mailing out ballots last month\\xa0citing delays\\xa0with their ballot printing vendor.\\n\"In both counties, the county clerk is reprinting the materials that contain incorrect statements and will send the corrected materials, along with a letter explaining the issue,\" Cegavske said, adding that the issues will have \"no effect on whether their mail ballot will be accepted and counted.\"\\nTEXAS\\nTexas saw long\\xa0lines\\xa0in some cities during its first day of early voting and record-breaking turnout in at least one major area, reports\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. There are an extra six days of early voting in Texas for the general election to give voters more options due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nMore than 68,000 people cast votes by early afternoon in Harris County, home to Houston and the state\\'s most populated county, which broke the county\\'s record for the first day of early voting, according to the\\xa0county clerk. There were reports of some problems around the state. In Fort Bend County, which borders Harris County and is home to the Houston suburbs, there were issues with some voting machines. The Fort Bend County Judge, the county executive,\\xa0tweeted\\xa0that \"those who are responsible will be held accountable\" and later said that the machines had been\\xa0fixed\\xa0at the county\\'s largest voting center. In Tarrant County, which is home to Fort Worth, one site opened two hours late after an election worker reported testing positive for COVID-19 on Monday night and officials had to find replacement staff.\\nHours before early voting began, a panel of federal appeals court judges on Monday night sided with Texas Governor Greg Abbott on his order allowing only one drop-off site per county where voters may hand-deliver their mail ballots.\\nAbbott issued an order in late July that would enable Texans to hand-deliver their ballots before Election Day. Normally, absentee ballots in the state must be returned through the mail, except on Election Day, when voters can deliver their ballots in person.\\nMonday night\\'s ruling reverses the lower court decision that blocked Abbott\\'s order on Friday night. The district court judge had concluded that allowing only one site per county imposed a \"burden on an already vulnerable voting population.\" But the three-judge appeals court panel -- all appointees of President Trump -- agreed with the Texas secretary of state\\'s argument that Abbott had already sufficiently expanded absentee voting options during the 2020 election by allowing people to return ballots before Election Day.\\n\"Leaving the Governor\\'s October 1 Proclamation in place still gives Texas absentee voters many ways to cast their ballots in the November 3 election,\" Judge Stuart Kyle Duncan wrote. \"These methods for remote voting outstrip what Texas law previously permitted in a pre-COVID world. The October 1 Proclamation abridges no one\\'s right to vote.\"\\nTexas has seen one of the highest upticks in newly registered voters in the nation reports\\xa0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro, with over 3 million people who registered after the 2016 election.\\nThat means just about 1 in every 5 voters in Texas in 2020 were not registered in 2016. Democrats are betting the surge has changed the electorate and could help flip Texas this year. As of Monday, Texas\\' secretary of state lists more than 16.9 million registered voters in its database, a state record and a net gain of 1.8 million since 2016. This gain is more than the gap in 2016 (Mr. Trump won by 807,179 votes) and 2018 (Senator Ted Cruz won his re-election against Democrat Beto O\\'Rourke by 214,921 votes).\\nThe uptick comes as polls have consistently shown the race as tied or Mr. Trump with a slight lead. Dr. Jill Biden visited Houston, Dallas and El Paso on Tuesday. Democrats say at least 60% of these added voters lean Democrat, because so many of them are young and from communities of color.\\n\"We always say 2020 is the year that demographics meets destiny in Texas,\" said Luke Warford, the Texas Democrats\\' voter expansion director. The state\\'s GOP state party says they\\'ve registered at least 160,000 likely Republican voters and that they\\'re confident in their outreach to other newly registered voters, particularly those who moved from blue states, will dispel any Democrat dreams.\\n\"They don\\'t want to see Texas become like the San Francisco or Manhattan they fled,\" said Texas GOP communications director Luke Twombly. Read more about the most-populated battleground state\\xa0here.\\nVIRGINIA\\nThe deadline to register to vote in Virginia is midnight Tuesday but for most of the day, the commonwealth\\'s online registration portal was down,\\xa0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte notes.\\nOfficials told CBS News that early Tuesday morning a fiber was cut near one of Virginia\\'s state technology centers which impacted data circuits used to run the Department of Elections\\' registration portal.\\nA spokesperson for the Department of Elections told CBS News that technicians were on site and working to repair the cut -- which ended up needing work for most of the day. It wasn\\'t until approximately 3:30p Tuesday that the portal was back online. State officials explained that a Verizon crew working on a ongoing utilities project inadvertently cut the fiber early Tuesday morning, cutting off access for Virginia voters.\\nThe problem was reminiscent of issues out of Florida last week when the state\\'s online registration portal crashed hours before the registration deadline. Consequently Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said their registration website was overwhelmed with traffic as more than 1 million voters per hour attempted to register in time. The registration deadline was pushed one day in Florida, but a large extension was rejected in federal court.Late Tuesday the Lawyers\\' Committee sued the Virginia Depart of Elections and the State Board of Elections to extend the deadline by 48 hours.\\nA new\\xa0Monmouth poll\\xa0released on Tuesday focusing on North Carolina found Democratic candidate Cal Cunningham\\'s admission of extramarital flirtatious texts has not severely impacted the race.\\nIn the poll, Cunningham is leading Republican incumbent Thom Tillis in a high turnout situation by 49 % to 44% compared to 47% to 45% in September. A model based on low turnout has the race closer at 48% to 47%.\\nThough Cunningham\\'s unfavorable number has grown from 22% to 33%, just 14% of voters feel the sexting relationship disqualifies Cunningham, and a majority (51%) believe this should just be an issue for Cunningham and his family.\\nIncumbent Republican Senator Thom Tillis tested positive for COVID-19 at the beginning of October, but more North Carolina voters know about Cunningham\\'s sexting (80%) than about Tillis\\' positive test (69%.) Half of the voters (50%) said Tillis did not take the pandemic seriously enough before he came down with it himself.\\xa0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\\xa0and\\xa0campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\\xa0spoke to voters\\xa0in North Carolina last week who did not feel the recent events surrounding either candidate would cause them to switch their votes.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'U.S. immigration authorities along the southern border made more than 57,000 apprehensions of undocumented migrants last month, as crossings by single adults, families and unaccompanied minors continued to increase steadily since plummeting in the spring.\\nMore than 50,000 of those apprehensions turned into rapid \"expulsions\" under a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) order that invokes a little-known, decades-old public health law designed to control the spread of communicable diseases, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data released Wednesday.\\nWhile they serve as the main metric to gauge unauthorized migration, border apprehensions — especially those during the pandemic — are not representative of the total number of migrants taken into U.S. custody, as many of those expelled to Mexico try crossing multiple times.\\nAsked when his agents can expect to stop implementing the unprecedented expulsions policy, acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan said at a press conference Wednesday that\\'s a decision for the CDC to make based on public health assessments of countries where migrants hail from. The Associated Press\\xa0reported\\xa0earlier this month that CDC experts opposed invoking this extraordinary public health authority, but relented under White House pressure.\\nCBP recorded more than 458,000 immigration arrests along the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2020, a significant decline from the 977,000 apprehensions made in the previous year, when a surge in crossings by Central American families and children overwhelmed U.S. migrant holding facilities.\\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security officials have used pandemic-era CDC orders to carry out more than 204,000 expulsions of migrants and asylum-seekers — including 8,800 unaccompanied children — since mid-March. These migrants are not placed in regular immigration proceedings or allowed to seek asylum, but are instead briefly held in the U.S. before being expelled to Mexico or their home countries.\\nThe Trump administration says the policy has allowed the U.S. to protect border officials and the broader American public from migrants who could spread the coronavirus inside detention facilities and the rest of the country. But migrant advocates have said the CDC directives are being weaponized to fulfill the administration\\'s objective of restricting access to humanitarian refuge for border-crossers, whom officials have accused of gaming the asylum system to enter the U.S.\\xa0\\nA federal magistrate judge late last month recommended the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., grant a request by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to block the Trump administration from expelling unaccompanied migrant children, whose protections under U.S. law have been largely suspended through the pandemic-era restrictions.\\nAccording to the data released Wednesday, CBP made nearly 3,900 apprehensions of unaccompanied children last month, the highest tally since August 2019. It is unclear how many of these minors were expelled under the CDC order or transferred to the U.S. refugee agency, as required by a 2008 Bush-era anti-trafficking law.\\nAt Wednesday\\'s press conference in Tucson, Arizona, top border enforcement officials said Mexican migrants make up the bulk of those apprehended. They highlighted a high \"recidivism\" rate of attempted border crossings. Border Patrol chief Rodney Scott noted that his agents\\' ability to apply \"consequences\" to those who cross without documents has been hindered because of the CDC\\'s orders.\\n\"We\\'re returning people very, very quickly, but our ability and willingness, if you will, to prosecute people to have a consequence to the illegal activity of crossing the border has been reduced because we know every single person that we take out of the Title 42 process and put into a judicial process where we\\'re going to be face-to-face, we\\'re going to have to detain them, is knowingly accepting additional risk to spread COVID in the United States,\" Scott said.\\nScott also announced Wednesday that 360 miles of border barriers have now been built, forecasting that 450 miles will be completed by the end of the year.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'For decades, the Republican Party lived by a creed, a model of decorum espoused by Ronald Reagan\\'s so-called eleventh commandment: \"Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican.\"\\xa0\\nBut that was before Donald Trump became president.\\nNow, a band of lifelong Republicans is using the lessons they learned over 30 years as political strategists for the GOP to do more than criticize their party. Rather, they are actively working to defeat its incumbent president and Republican senators who support him.\\xa0\\nCalled the Lincoln Project, the group was founded by eight men and women who had previously worked with Republicans such as Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, and President George W. Bush. Although it has endorsed the Democratic presidential hopeful, former Vice President Joe Biden, the group has said they do not represent any particular candidate, campaign, or party.\\xa0\\nWhat the Lincoln Project does speak for is a feeling for some that the Republican Party has betrayed its longtime members.\\n\"We\\'ve gone from caring about character, rule of law, defending the constitution, a cogent national security policy, free trade. Where are all those issues?\" said co-founder John Weaver, a strategist who previously worked with McCain and John Kasich. \"Imagine if you had traveled the country for 30 years, fighting for Republican principles, and you learn it was all a lie. No one cares about all the issues that we fought for.\"\\nIn an interview with 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl, members of the Lincoln Project explained what they see as the roots of the Republican Party\\'s shift.\\nFor strategist John Weaver, the Freedom Caucus helped catalyze the Republican Party\\'s transformation. Formed in 2015, the congressional caucus is made up of conservative Republican members of Congress who are often at odds with members of their own party. Among its founders are Rep. Jim Jordan, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, and former Director of the Office of Management and Budget and Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.\\nWeaver pointed to the group\\'s opposition to a compromise immigration reform bill as what he said is a particular mistake.\\n\"The party constantly lied about Obamacare, they constantly claimed they cared about the national debt, and meanwhile the national debt continued to go up while Republicans were in power,\" he said. \"And it made Republicans even more cynical, the Republican voters more cynical so that when Trump arrived, they were desperate for someone to wreck the system.\"\\nBut before the Freedom Caucus, Weaver told Stahl, another presidential contest marked a shift in the party — the 2008 campaign. The party had begun to change before that election, Weaver said, but McCain expedited the transformation when he selected former Alaska Gov. Sara Palin as his vice presidential running mate.\\n\"It was a reality TV show choice,\" he said. \"It was a mistake.\"\\nLincoln Project co-founder Steve Schmidt was a senior campaign strategist and top adviser to McCain during his 2008 campaign. He told Stahl he, too, regrets that Palin was put on the ticket, even though he had originally encouraged McCain to select her.\\n\"What you saw for the first time with Palin was someone who was breathtakingly dishonest not being held to account for her breathtaking dishonesty by a lot of news organizations, particularly those with a partisan agenda,\" he said. \"She was unfit in a profound level.\"\\nSchmidt claims that, for years, Fox News and right-wing conservatives continued to use Palin to push the idea that science was irrelevant and credible news was \"fake.\" The effect, he said, was to energize other politicians like her.\\xa0\\n\"The category of people that we have seen in our politics over the last decade or so, from Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz, to Sarah Palin is part of the reason the country\\'s politics are such a disaster,\" Schmidt said. \"And part of the reason the country\\'s in such a mess.\"\\nRick Wilson, a media consultant and ad maker who worked for Republicans including Rudy Guiliani and President George H.W. Bush, feels Trump has set in motion a dark aspect of the Republican Party that had been lurking for years.\\xa0\\n\"There were parts of the GOP that we have to look at and be honest about what it was,\" Wilson told Stahl. \"We didn\\'t, as a broad party, look at the people in parts of the base in the South and parts of the Midwest who were not motivated by free markets or limited government or individual liberty. They were motivated by racial animus. There is a part of it\\'s out there. And we have to look at it honestly.\"\\nWilson pointed to President Ronald Reagan\\'s unambiguous repudiation of the Ku Klux Klan. In a 1984 letter to Morris Abram, then-vice chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Reagan disassociated himself with the Klan and other hate groups, writing:\\nThe politics of racial hatred and religious bigotry practiced by the Klan and others have no place in this country, and are destructive of the values for which America has always stood… I firmly believe there is no room for partisanship on this question. Democrats and Republicans alike must be resolute in disassociating ourselves from any group or individual whose political philosophy consists only of racial or religious intolerance, whose arguments are supported only by intimidation or threats of violence.\\nBut, Wilson said, the Republican Party continued to tolerate members who subscribed to racist beliefs, leading Trump to, in Wilson\\'s words, \"play footsie\" with them by not immediately denouncing former Klan leader David Duke in 2016.\\xa0\\n\"We should have purged them,\" Wilson said of the underbelly of racism among Republicans. \"We never did.\"\\n60 Minutes\\' Stahl pushed back, asking whether Wilson feels responsibility for previously promoting a party that had never fully eradicated racist elements.\\nWilson responded that, while he had never represented politicians with racist beliefs, he did work for candidates he feels \"ashamed\" of today.\\n\"I helped elect Rudy Giuliani,\" he said. \"And he\\'s gone off the rails, and not in a racial sense, but he\\'s gone off the rails completely as this, you know, sort of conspirator in chief with Trump. It\\'s sad.\"\\nIf Bernie Sanders had become the Democratic presidential nominee, would the Lincoln Project be doing what it is today?\\xa0\\nFormer McCain advisor Steve Schmidt says yes.\\xa0\\n\"Because Bernie Sanders believes in American democracy,\" he said. \"He believes in American elections. He believes in the fairness of the election process. And that\\'s what this is all about.\"\\nWhile the members of the Lincoln Project say they disagree with Sanders on a host of issues, particularly his economic agenda, they all agreed that they would have supported him should he have been the candidate opposite Trump.\\xa0\\n\"He\\'s not un-American. Donald Trump is fundamentally un-American…\" Rick Wilson said. \"He doesn\\'t believe in the role of a president as a leader of a nation. Instead, Donald Trump looks at the presidency as a way to enrich himself and aggrandize himself. And these are just fundamentally different categories.\"\\nTo watch Lesley Stahl\\'s 60 Minutes report on the Lincoln Project, click here.\\nThe videos above were edited by Will Croxton.\\xa0\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Texas has seen one of the highest upticks in newly registered voters in the nation, with over 3 million people who registered after the 2016 election.\\xa0\\nThat means about 1 in every 5 voters in Texas in 2020 were not registered in 2016 and Democrats are betting the surge could help flip Texas this year.\\xa0\\nAs of Monday, Texas\\' secretary of state lists more than 16.9 million registered voters in its database, a state record and a net gain of 1.8 million since 2016.\\nPresident Trump won the state by 807,179 votes in 2016. Democratic Senate candidate Beto O\\'Rourke lost his statewide race by 214,921 votes.\\nWhile registration gains ebbed in March and April, at the beginning of the pandemic, more than 585,000 new voters have registered since September 1.\\xa0\\nThe Census Bureau says Texas\\' population has grown by 3.85 million since 2010, 2 million of whom are Hispanic.\\nEarly voting in Texas kicks off Tuesday. More than 1.8 million Texans voted early in the March primaries, about 45% of the total turnout. Including mail votes, over half of Texans voted early or by mail during the primary. \\xa0\\nTexans aren\\'t required to designate a party when they register, but Democratic operatives anticipate at least 60% of these new voters are Democrats because so many of them are young and from communities of color.\\xa0\\n\"We think that population skews heavily Democrat,\" said Luke Warford, the Texas Democrats\\' voter expansion director. \"And what that means is that\\'s going to translate to a lot of Democratic victories up and down the ballot in November.\"\\nIn the state\\'s 10 most-populated counties, the epicenters for these population hikes and shifting demographics, there have been more than 402,000 newly registered voters since January.\\xa0\\nThe state hasn\\'t elected a Democrat for president since 1976, but has tight polling margins consistent with other key battleground states. The latest CBS News Battleground Tracker has President Trump tied with Vice President Joe Biden, 49% to 49%, but still leaning Republican because of its electoral history.\\nThe poll also shows that at least six out of 10 Hispanic support Biden, which is consistent with historic trends. About one-third of the Hispanic vote has gone to Republicans in the past decade.\\xa0\\nA poll from the University of Texas/Texas Tribune released last week showed Mr. Trump leading Biden by a larger margin, 50% to 45%.\\xa0\\nSince September 2019, the Texas Republican party says it has been able to register at least 160,000 likely Republican voters who have moved into the state, and they\\'re \"confident\" their outreach efforts will keep Texas Republican.\\xa0\\n\"These blue-state refugees simply need to be educated on the policy failures of their old homes. They don\\'t want to see Texas become like the San Francisco or Manhattan they fled,\" said Texas GOP communications director Luke Twombly.\\xa0\\nIn June 2019, GOP super PAC Engage Texas started to ramp up Republican registrations. But by May, the group shuttered, citing the coronavirus as a reason.\\xa0\\nBiden\\'s campaign is making a big play for the Lone Star State. It has spent over $8 million on ads, according to Kantar/CMAG data. Mr. Trump\\'s campaign is spending about $6.8 million on Texas air time.\\nThe Democratic nominee has mostly stuck to virtual events to rally supporters, relying mostly on Texas-based surrogates. But on Tuesday, Jill Biden will be visiting Houston, Dallas and El Paso to mark the start of early voting. Joe Biden last visited the Lone Star State in early March, ahead of Super Tuesday.\\nThe Trump campaign has been campaigning in person in Texas and surrogates have traveled to the state. Mr. Trump visited Texas multiple times this summer for White House official events and fundraisers, and Vice President Pence went to Dallas in June.\\xa0\\nThe other races on the ballot have dwarfed the presidential contest in spending. More than $30 million has been spent on the state\\'s Senate race between incumbent John Cornyn and MJ Hegar, according to Kantar/CMAG data. Around $16.7 million has been spent overall in the presidential campaign.\\xa0\\nAbout $51 million has been collectively raised by candidates in the 10 battleground House races, the latest FEC reports note. In the races for the eight GOP-held or open seats the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is targeting, three Democrats are out raising their GOP opponents.\\xa0\\nDemocrats are also betting that the registration upticks are more than enough to overcome close losses during Beto O\\'Rourke\\'s 2018 Senate race. Congressman Dan Crenshaw kept Texas\\' 2nd Congressional district Republican and won by 19,196 votes in 2018.\\nO\\'Rourke saw a tighter margin, losing by a slim 3,099 votes in this district. One of his former advisers, Sima Ladjevardian, is running as a Democratic nominee against Crenshaw.\\nCrenshaw, a former Navy Seal, is popular in the state and an effective fundraiser, raking in $9.26 million this cycle for his re-election. But on paper, the Houston-area district has seen the changing and diversifying demographics that Democrats are optimistic about. The 2nd District is entirely based in Harris County, which has seen an uptick of at least 60,000 registered voters since 2018.\\xa0\\n\"The dynamics of Harris County have completely changed,\" Ladjevardian said. \"It\\'s been years of tireless organizing — that is something that had been taking place in Beto\\'s race. But since 2018, I think everyone is understanding everything is on the line this time.\"\\nMultiple organizations, from O\\'Rourke\\'s \\'Powered by People\\' PAC to Voto Latino, have focused on voter registration efforts. Voto Latino announced Monday that it has registered 257,294 Texans for the 2020 election cycle.\\xa0\\nMichael Adams, political science department chair at Texas Southern University, said Democrats have been winning the voter registration battle because of the enthusiasm generated by the House and Senate races on the ballot. Democrats flipped 12 state House seats in 2018, and are nine away from flipping the chamber altogether ahead of 2021 redistricting.\\xa0\\n\"I don\\'t think it will be a whole lot about who\\'s at the top of the ticket. I don\\'t see a lot of enthusiasm, to be honest with you, when it comes to Biden....I think the local ground game here is because of that interest and the excitement and anticipation in [the other] races,\" Adams said. \"They\\'re going to be pivotal.\"\\nIn July, Governor Greg Abbott authorized an extra six days of early in-person voting in Texas because of the COVID-19 pandemic, after rejecting calls to expand access to mail-in voting. Republicans tried to sue to block the extended period, but last week the Texas Supreme Court left the extended time frame in place.\\nThere are ongoing legal battles over Abbott\\'s recent order limiting mail-in ballot drop-off sites to one per county. On Friday, a federal judge blocked his order, but the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals put the order back into effect the next day, meaning the limit is still in place.\\nAdam Brewster and Kabir Khanna contributed reporting.\\n'}]"
