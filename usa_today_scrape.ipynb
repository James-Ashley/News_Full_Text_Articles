      "Cash-strapped renters nationwide say their landlords tried to skirt COVID-19 eviction moratoriums by changing locks, removing trash containers so waste piled up and – in one case – attempting to unbolt the front door right off an apartment.\n",
      "They told state attorneys general that they were kicked out of their homes after landlords accused them of violating tenant rules, like smoking cigarettes inside their units or failing to take the hitches off of their mobile homes.\n",
      "Like Heidi Stach, who lost her job due to the pandemic and fell behind on rent, they assumed they were protected. But Stach says her landlord found an end-run to Wisconsin’s eviction ban: Instead of starting a court process, he sent her a notice to vacate this summer because he was not renewing her lease.\n",
      "That type of informal or “extrajudicial” eviction is a work-around to the patchwork of emergency state and federal rules created this year to prevent landlords from ejecting tenants into unstable or crowded living arrangements during the health emergency. \n",
      "What once was a fringe concern has become a quiet scourge across the nation, said Eric Dunn, director of litigation at the National Housing Law Project, feeding housing instability concerns among the millions who have missed rent payments.\n",
      "“Since the pandemic started, and courts froze their dockets or had moratoriums, we’ve seen a huge spike in tactics from landlords to get people out,” Dunn said, “including changing locks, cutting off utility service, refusing to make repairs, making threats, providing misinformation and any other creative way to accuse someone of a lease violation that fits an exception in the moratorium.”\n",
      "Tricks and intimidation behind the scenes add to more overt efforts by landlords to legally evict tenants. With statewide bans largely expired and federal protection from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention moratorium nearing its final days, tenant advocates like Dunn fear things will only get worse.\n",
      "USA TODAY reviewed hundreds of complaints about landlords filed through the summer by consumers with attorneys general in seven states, including Maryland, Missouri, Ohio, Washington state and Wisconsin.\n",
      "Landlords, they told the state agencies, hiked rents even as the tenants lost their jobs and missed utility bill payments. They skipped out on basic maintenance and let conditions deteriorate, leaving renters a choice between leaving on their own or living with mold outbreaks or infestations of bed bugs, roaches and maggots.\n",
      "While the complaints offer a window into the problem, tenants often found their efforts to enlist state help went nowhere since wrongful evictions typically must be fought in court.\n",
      "From elderly residents on Social Security to single mothers struggling with unemployment, some reported that they were pushed into homelessness, where they could not take basic steps to protect themselves from the virus.\n",
      "That threat was a driving force behind the moratoriums, and a group of epidemiologists found this month that the measures have helped stem COVID-19’s spread, particularly in poorer neighborhoods where court-ordered eviction is more prevalent.\n",
      "Stach, the mother of a 15-year-old daughter with disabilities, came up short in April on her $850 rent. Her lease was up but she assumed she could renew it. Instead, she came home to the notice to vacate.\n",
      "“It was devastating. I was confused and crying and felt like I was having a panic attack,” Stach said. “I lost my job and now I had to basically beg someone to let us live somewhere else instead of a homeless shelter.”\n",
      "Stach complained to Wisconsin's consumer protection agency, which intervened as a mediator, but did not manage to resolve the dispute. Eventually she located a new apartment, but it’s more expensive and in a different neighborhood of La Crosse, requiring her to transfer her daughter to another school district.\n",
      "Finding a place to live came with added challenges because Stach has a criminal record tied to past drug use. But, armed with a new job at a cheese manufacturer, she was able to get a lease – with an additional rider that says she will be evicted if she has a drug relapse.\n",
      "“In the middle of this, it’s a lot to pay for rent plus a new security deposit on such short notice while everyone is freaking out about the pandemic,” Stach said.\n",
      "Her previous landlord at Reliant Real Estate Services said he couldn’t discuss specific tenants but he said none had faced non-renewals or eviction proceedings since late spring. He added that those with looming lease expirations can negotiate move-out dates or month-to-month extensions.\n",
      "“Evictions and lease non-renewals are never a desired outcome,” Reliant President Aaron Wickesburg wrote in an email. “We will continue to do whatever we can to help keep our tenants in their homes.”\n",
      "Eviction moratoriums under the federal CARES Act expired on July 25. Many state bans also ended over the summer, or in the fall. The remaining CDC order, enacted Sept. 4, has a simple goal: prevent evictions for non-payment of rent during the pandemic.\n",
      "But the CDC’s rules are full of exemptions and tricky legal definitions, leaving openings for unscrupulous landlords.\n",
      "The current CDC order, set to expire Dec. 31, specifies that evictions for non-payment of rent can be prevented if renters fill out a form declaring that they make less than $99,000, are trying to make partial payments and would likely be homeless if evicted. Rent still accrues and is due eventually.\n",
      "The CDC order comes with criminal penalties, but neither the agency nor the U.S. Department of Justice answered questions on whether a single landlord has been prosecuted.\n",
      "The order also offers five other reasons evictions can move forward: criminal activity, threats to other residents, damage to property, violation of building codes or violation of any other aspect of a lease.\n",
      "Dunn said landlords can find subtle ways to use those exemptions to evict a non-paying renter, say when adding a satellite dish turns out to be a lease violation, or when a boyfriend stays over more nights than allowed in the guest portion of the lease. Non-renewals of leases that lead to eviction are a gray area in the CDC order.\n",
      "“If a landlord truly wants to evict someone, you know they can find a reason,” said Andrew Aurand, vice president for research at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n",
      "Aurand and others have lobbied on Capitol Hill for a federal rent assistance program as part of a pandemic relief bill. Tenant groups favor such programs, which would cost as much as $100 billion, over extended eviction moratoriums.\n",
      "“The real concern is what happens in January if we don’t find a rental solution,” Aurand said, “and the 30 to 40 million people that again will be at risk for eviction.”\n",
      "Extrajudicial or “self-help” evictions – in which landlords take matters into their own hands – date back to Roman law. They were part of English common law and then barred by U.S. courts to quell violence. Today, they refer to any method outside the legal court eviction process.\n",
      "While self-help removals are by their nature impossible to measure, the usual number of court evictions offers a hint of the tsunami some advocates fear could be coming, obscured by the various COVID-19 restrictions.\n",
      "The National Housing Law Project estimates about 900,000 legal judicial evictions take place in the U.S. each year. Research by the Eviction Lab at Princeton University indicates that, on average across 26 tracked cities, eviction filings have dropped by more than half during the pandemic, but now are steadily increasing.\n",
      "Tenants facing an extrajudicial situation have few options, especially if all of their belongings are locked away by a landlord or they can’t afford legal representation.\n",
      "With the help of free legal aid representation, Lena Jefferson of Washington, D.C., took her complaint to court in the fall, filing a wrongful eviction claim against her landlord.\n",
      "She says her landlord moved her to temporary housing after her apartment flooded, but problems there led her to withhold rent until a better solution was found. Instead, her landlord locked her out.\n",
      "“I’ve been living in a rooming house,” Jefferson said. “It’s another stress that’s constantly on your mind when you’re moving from place to place.”\n",
      "In West Palm Beach, Florida, Legal Aid Society attorney Tequisha Myles said her program quadrupled its staffing for eviction prevention work after the pandemic began. Her program represents one couple that was evicted but is now countersuing because the landlord locked them out of a rental house without going through a formal court process.\n",
      "“The laws are very clear even before the pandemic: Turning off electricity or water or blocking access to the property is prohibited,” Myles said. “I understand that many landlords are struggling and they haven’t been paid, but you have to follow the law.”\n",
      "Attorneys in Massachusetts challenged Gov. Charlie Baker’s blanket moratorium on evictions this summer, arguing it was overly broad and unconstitutional, said real estate attorney Richard Vetstein.\n",
      "“The state ban was the strictest by far,” Vetstein said. “Unlike the CDC moratorium, it applied to every eviction case, including lease expirations, most behavioral issues, for-cause evictions and squatting.”\n",
      "The case’s named landlord, Marie Baptiste, had a tenant who owed $18,900 for eight months of unpaid rent and was struggling to maintain her finances.\n",
      "“Everyone’s getting screwed,” Vetstein said, adding that the moratoriums don’t solve cash flow shortages. He called for rental assistance to help tenants.\n",
      "Vetstein said he’s warned clients to avoid self-help actions no matter how frustrated they become. He said some have turned to “cash for keys” programs where landlords pay non-paying tenants to leave.\n",
      "Researchers at the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, surveyed nearly 1,400 landlords in October. They reported that 38% said they did not expect to receive full rent payments that month. More than a third also said they had added stricter screening for new tenants, such as requiring higher credit scores and higher income.\n",
      "Landlord groups have challenged the CDC order’s constitutionality in federal courts in Atlanta, Memphis, and Columbus and Akron, Ohio. So far, federal judges have declined to knock down the order.\n",
      "National housing groups have been disappointed in a Department of Justice legal brief in the Atlanta case that seemed to encourage landlords to pursue evictions now in anticipation of the moratorium lifting.\n",
      "“Even where a tenant is entitled to its protections, the Order does not bar a landlord from commencing a state court eviction proceeding, provided that that actual eviction does not occur while the order remains in place,” DOJ lawyers wrote, in language that ended up in a CDC “frequently asked questions” document.\n",
      "That’s what’s happening in Maryland, where despite a ban on actual evictions, the apartment company owned by White House adviser Jared Kushner has been sending letters to tenants “threatening legal fees and then filing eviction notices in court – a first legal step toward removing tenants,” according to the Washington Post. \n",
      "Colleen Foley, head of the Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee, says the county already has a backlog of cases filed by landlords just waiting to boot renters as soon as judges allow it.\n",
      "However, she said local landlord groups are unified with the legal aid community in calling for government rental assistance.\n",
      "“It’s a rare moment, for sure,” Foley said. “Everyone understands we all rise and fall together.”\n",
      "USA TODAY’s review of complaints filed with various state attorneys general shows landlords across the country attempted to raise rents on financially struggling tenants, and then turned to extreme measures to evict them when they could not pay.\n",
      "One Missouri renter said she was forced to leave her apartment during the pandemic after the landlord raised rent $35 a month and the monthly dog fee by $5.\n",
      "Others in the state complained of even steeper hikes, despite job losses and other financial hardships.\n",
      "“During a pandemic like we’ve never seen before, they’re acting like everything was normal,” said Debbie Carter, who filed a complaint in March after her landlord raised her rent and would not let her go month-to-month on her lease.\n",
      "In the deep woods near the Ozarks, residents of a shuttered nine-hole golf resort that was converted into apartments say their landlord tripled rents, threatened them with eviction and had them work under the table to repair the derelict units to pay off their debts.\n",
      "The former timeshare property had been neglected for years, with mold growing on stairs, ceilings and curtains. Residents complained to the state about holes in the walls and floor, where roaches, ants and bed bugs scurried.\n",
      "Laura Loyd had been living in a two-bedroom unit there for two years when it changed ownership at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, in February. Out of work, she was struggling to make the $575-a-month rent, and asked if she could split it into two installments. \n",
      "Her landlord instead emailed her a notice to vacate, saying that he had nearly tripled the rent on the 850-square-foot apartment to $1,500 per month, and she had to either pay that amount right away or get out, according to a complaint she filed with the Missouri Attorney General's Office.\n",
      "Duplexes dot the property known as LaGrand Lodges, which lines a river and forest, with weeds growing in an old tennis court, an emptied out swimming pool and long-closed restaurant. When it’s cold, utility bills rise to hundreds of dollars per month because of the poor insulation, Loyd said.\n",
      "She told USA TODAY that she received two more eviction notices. The landlord never formally took her to court but, tired of his scare tactics, she opted to leave. \n",
      "“It got so bad,” said Loyd, who has since moved to Arkansas. “We couldn’t be there anymore.”\n",
      "Loyd wasn’t the only tenant of LaGrand Lodges who complained to the attorney general. When neighbor Tasha Tavenner couldn’t pay rent, two men attempted to pull the front door right off its hinges until Tavenner called the police, according to her handwritten complaint.\n",
      "The single mother of four had been laid off from her job at a resort in nearby Branson when tourism froze up from coronavirus. \n",
      "With no money coming in amid the threats of rent increases, she tried to work out a deal where she would help fix the deteriorating units, including ripping out carpets and tearing down walls. \n",
      "At least four other tenants who couldn’t afford to pay also were working as handymen off the books to pay down rent debts, Tavenner said. \n",
      "In April, she asked for three additional weeks to come up with rent money. White and green mold had gotten so bad that Tavenner said she moved everything but the family’s beds into storage, even keeping their clothes in the car. At one point, she remembers maggots crawling around on the carpet.\n",
      "She complained in April to the state Attorney General’s Office, which told her that there was nothing that they could do. The agency did not return several calls and emails from USA TODAY seeking comment.\n",
      "With kids ages 2, 8, 12 and 15, Tavenner decided that she couldn’t take it anymore. They left in early May, she said, and ended up camping together in the woods for five weeks until they could find a new place to stay.\n",
      "“I wasn’t even two months late on my rent,” Tavenner said. “They started harassing me on a daily basis. It was scary. It got really ugly.”\n",
      "Tony LaGrand, who was the landlord at the time but no longer owns the property, planned to renovate the former timeshare and turn it back into nightly rentals. He had just turned 24 when he purchased the units in February. It was his first time as a landlord, he said.  \n",
      "He went months without any rent from tenants, he said, even though he says many were collecting unemployment checks. LaGrand did not deny attempting to raise rents or file evictions, but he said he did not break any rules and tried first to ask the tenants who could not pay to leave on their own.\n",
      "LaGrand, who lost the property to foreclosure, says he’s now more than $1.6 million in debt.\n",
      "“The place was falling apart,” LaGrand said. “I didn’t have any rent coming in, and people wouldn’t pay. It was a really messed up situation. I spent my entire life savings on this project.”\n",
      "Across the country, landlords evicted their tenants over unapproved guests, pets and other alleged violations to various apartment rules. One blind man in Ohio lived on the streets following a dispute with his landlords over smoking cigarettes inside the unit.\n",
      "Yet most consumers who spoke with USA TODAY said that their attorneys general were ultimately unable to help. State regulators can act as mediators in disputes, but challenges to evictions are often only successful in court.\n",
      "In Ohio, David Whipple complained to the attorney general after the Wellness Village affordable housing complex for seniors in Canton sent him a notice of eviction in February, a month before the national moratorium began. \n",
      "The facility claimed to have found ashes from cigarettes in the bathroom, and workers said they could smell smoke near the unit. It accused Whipple of violating its rules. Whipple's complaint also alleges he was charged late fees for rent for several months even though he paid his $651 rent on time. \n",
      "When reached by USA TODAY, Whipple acknowledged he had smoked a cigarette because he was nervous about an upcoming eye surgery. But the 64-year-old, who is blind, said staff at the senior living complex continued to accuse him of breaking the rules.\n",
      "Following the notice of eviction in February, the virus put the process on hold for several months. When the CARES Act relief bill was signed in March, it included an eviction moratorium for 120 days on public housing, housing choice vouchers and FHA-insured multifamily properties. \n",
      "But by the time that moratorium expired in July, Whipple was in court, where the judge ruled against him. By August, he was out.\n",
      "“They kicked out a senior citizen during COVID-19 like they didn’t have a care in the world,” Whipple said. “I didn’t deserve what they did to me.”\n",
      "A representative, who answered the phone at Wellness Village and identified herself as a manager but declined to give her name, said the property followed the necessary guidance from the court system.\n",
      "“We had to wait until we had permission from the courts, and when we did, we moved forward,” the property manager said. She declined further comment.\n",
      "Whipple’s complaint was among nearly 200 filed with the attorney general in Ohio related to issues with landlords and COVID-19. Whipple said he ultimately got no help from the agency.\n",
      "When Kansas Fecher of western Ohio could not pay her April rent after being laid off due to the virus, she told the landlord that as soon as her unemployment check came in, she could get caught up. The landlord instead gave her four days to get out, according to the complaint.\n",
      "Another Ohio renter complained that the property owner illegally changed the locks on her and other tenants residing in the home, while removing the city trash container so waste piled up.  \n",
      "At a mobile home park in Lancaster, residents said the landlord threatened to evict them for rule violations, including failing to take the hitches off their trailers. Most of the tenants are too old to take the hitches off their own trailers, and the manager of the park knows this, the complaint states. \n",
      "In Ohio, the attorney general’s consumer protection division does not have jurisdiction over landlord and tenant complaints. The office says it tries to work with people as a courtesy, but renters who complained say they received little help to ward off aggressive landlords.\n",
      "With no family to turn to, Whipple said he was forced into homelessness. He’s shuffled among five houses of friends and other people trying to help him.\n",
      "“I’m just in a bad situation,” he said. “I don’t know what to do.”\n",

       "  'body': 'Questions are continuing to be asked Monday after\\xa0President Donald Trump\\xa0refused to discuss his tax returns after a report said he paid only $750 in personal federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017, and he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years.\\xa0Trump on Sunday dismissed a\\xa0New York Times investigation\\xa0into his tax records, which revealed a string of financial losses that helped him avoid paying taxes, and showed the president is beset by hundreds of millions\\xa0in personal debt that will come due within the next four years. The analysis\\xa0also found Trump earned millions abroad after he took office, raising questions about whether it conflicts with his role as president.\\xa0The president dismissed the story Sunday during a\\xa0news conference, calling the reporting \"totally fake news.\"\\xa0Trump was the first major presidential candidate in four decades to refuse to release tax returns and has long used the excuse that he cannot reveal them due to an audit by the Internal Revenue Service. However, an audit does not prevent Trump from releasing his records.\\nPrefer to listen? Check out the 5 things podcast below and\\xa0subscribe for free\\xa0on Apple Podcasts:\\xa0\\nCalifornia residents are bracing for another wave of wildfires\\xa0as the state is exposed to “critical risks for fire weather’’ Monday. The state’s biggest utility, PG&E, said it planned to cut off power to 89,000 customers\\xa0Sunday through Monday morning, mostly in the Northern and Central Sierra but also extending to parts of the San Francisco Bay Area, as a preventive measure to avoid igniting fires. The number of affected customers was later reduced to 65,000.\\xa0\\xa0A new fire erupted early Sunday in the Napa Valley wine country north of San Francisco, quickly burning through 1,000 acres and forcing officials to order mandatory evacuations.\\xa0\\nHundreds, possibly thousands, of immigrant children are being held in hotels in several cities for prolonged periods of time under secretive emergency measures that quickly expel undocumented immigrants who arrive at the border during the pandemic. A federal judge last week gave the Trump administration until Monday to put an end to the practice.\\xa0U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee ruled Sept. 4 that the government\\'s detention of children longer than 72 hours violated a settlement that governs the\\xa0treatment of immigrant children in custody – and\\xa0previously ordered the Trump administration to stop holding the children in hotels as part of the policy by Sept. 15. But the practice has continued while the Trump administration sought stays pending an appeal.\\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning will try again Monday to finish off the Dallas Stars as the two teams meet in Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals (8 p.m. ET, NBC). The Lightning lead the Stars in the best-of-seven series, three games to two. The Stars stayed alive in Game 5 Saturday in a come-from-behind, double-overtime victory. Center Joe Pavelski tied the game in the third period with a power-play goal and Corey Perry sealed the 3-2 win with his second goal of the game. Interesting stat: The Lightning are 6-0 in the postseason after a loss.\\xa0\\nYom Kippur, which is observed from sundown Sunday to sundown Monday, is considered the holiest day of the year in Judaism. It’s a high holiday that follows Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. Yom Kippur translates from Hebrew to English as Day of Atonement. Traditionally, Jews spend the holiday fasting and reflecting on sins committed over the past year.\\xa0 According to Jewish tradition, one\\'s fate is decided on Rosh Hashanah and sealed on Yom Kippur.\\xa0People who observe Yom Kippur neither eat nor drink for 25 hours, with the exception of children and those for whom fasting is dangerous. Once the period of fasting ends, it’s time to break the fast with bagels and egg dishes.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'In the end, it might\\xa0have been too much even for\\xa0a disciplined debater like Vice President Mike Pence to credibly defend a mismanaged health care crisis that has\\xa0killed more Americans than any event since World War II.\\nIt was never Pence\\'s style, nor would it\\xa0have been politically wise,\\xa0to mimic the president\\'s scorched-earth filibustering of last week\\'s presidential debate\\xa0— a tactic that trampled any coherent discussion and also turned off vast swaths of the viewing public, actually widening Democratic presidential nominee\\xa0Joe Biden\\'s\\xa0lead in the polls.\\nThe more reserved Pence, a former congressman and radio talk-show host who heads the White House Coronavirus Task Force, played the kinder, gentler Trump in his\\xa0face-off Wednesday with Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris at the\\xa0University of Utah.\\n“I want all of you to know, you’ll always be in our hearts and our prayers,\" he said to the families of the nearly 212,000 who have died from the disease.\\nIt was weak medicine for the reality of a pandemic so unrestrained that the\\xa0White House itself has become an epicenter, with a president sickened by\\xa0COVID-19 and stalking the West Wing on Tuesday potentially shedding virus. Pence offered little in response to the indictment by his opponent, a former prosecutor, that Trump\\xa0chronically minimized the seriousness of the disease and failed to produce a\\xa0plan for defeating it.\\n“The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country,” Harris\\xa0said. Inexplicably, however, she failed to bring up Pence\\'s prediction in April that \"by Memorial Day weekend we will largely have this coronavirus epidemic behind us.\"\\xa0\\nEven the debate\\'s set design in Salt Lake City underscored the nation\\'s No. 1 issue. Fear of infection kept the candidates more than 12 feet apart and separated by\\xa0plexiglass shields. Audience members were distanced and strictly forbidden to remove their face masks.\\nBy contrast, the president and Biden were separated by just over 6 feet\\xa0in the Cleveland debate last week, and Trump\\'s family members defied requests to wear face coverings. Since\\xa0then, Trump, the\\xa0first lady, growing numbers of White House staffers and allies have\\xa0tested positive for COVID-19.\\xa0\\nThis was billed as arguably the most important vice presidential debate in history, given that Trump is 74 and ailing\\xa0and that Biden, at 77, would be the oldest person elected president.\\nMoreover, the vice presidential debate\\xa0could conceivably have been\\xa0the final face-off of the campaign, considering lingering questions whether the presidential debates\\xa0scheduled for Oct. 15 and Oct. 22 will take place as scheduled.\\nPence scored more debate points when the topic wasn\\'t coronavirus, often doing a better job of defending the Trump administration\\'s record than Trump does\\xa0himself. The vice president\\xa0boasted\\xa0of the administration\\'s early economic successes and victories over the Islamic State terrorist organization.\\nIn one particularly effective attack, he questioned how Biden\\xa0could reverse\\xa0Trump\\'s signature tax cuts — as the Democrat has promised\\xa0— and not raise\\xa0taxes on middle-income Americans, also as promised. Harris didn\\'t have a good answer.\\xa0\\nAs a politician vying to be the first female vice president and the first one of color, Harris\\'\\xa0mission was to hold the Trump administration to account\\xa0without appearing overly negative or aggressive, and risk turning off voters who research shows are less forgiving of such traits\\xa0in women. She also needed to assure a capacity for stepping into the presidency at a moment\\'s notice.\\xa0\\nFor the most part\\xa0she succeeded, highlighting her immigrant parents and her service as California attorney general before election to the U.S. Senate. And whenever Pence began to talk over her, she kept him in check with a simple: \"Mr. Vice President, I\\'m speaking.\"\\nBoth nominees ducked some of the toughest questions from moderator Susan Page, USA TODAY\\'s Washington bureau chief. When pressed by Pence, Harris notably refused to say whether\\xa0Biden would try to expand the size of the Supreme Court if Democrats captured control of the White House and the Senate.\\nThe evening\\'s strongest takeaway — beyond the fly that landed on Pence\\'s hair\\xa0 — was a reminder of what civilized political debate once was, before the era of Trump, and might well be again someday.\\n'},\n",

John Fetterman, said she was subjected to xenophobic and racist insults in a confrontation she\\xa0captured briefly on video and posted to Twitter.\\nGisele Fetterman, a formerly undocumented immigrant from Brazil who became an American citizen in 2009, said she went to an Aldi’s near her home to buy kiwis.\\nWhile standing in line to check out, Fetterman said she was accosted by a woman who said, “There’s that (n-word) that Fetterman married” and called the state\\'s second lady a thief who did not belong here.\\nFetterman, 38, said she was unaccompanied by her “amazing” security team because the family was in on a rainy Sunday night and she was just darting out “for what I thought would be a five-minute trip to the grocery store.”\\nJohn Fetterman\\xa0is the former mayor of Braddock,\\xa0and the couple still live there with their three children.\\nOn Monday, Fetterman told the USA TODAY Network that the woman would hurl insults, walk away and then return to continue the verbal barrage. A woman standing behind her asked if she was alone and warned her to not walk to her car alone, Fetterman said.\\nShe was too upset to notify employees, Fetterman said. “I just wanted to get out of there and get home,” she said.\\nRead more on race and identity: Sign up for USA TODAY’s This Is America newsletter\\xa0\\nFetterman said she paid for her kiwis and looked for the woman, but did not see her. As she was backing her car out of her parking space, Fetterman said the woman came out of the store empty-handed and headed for her car.\\nShaking and crying, Fetterman said she reached for her phone to record the incident, but only managed to capture the last few seconds in which the woman pulls down her mask and says, “You’re a (n-word).”\\nSince Sunday’s incident, Fetterman said she has heard from other residents who reported similar racist incidents with the woman, some involving children.\\n“This behavior and this hatred is taught,” Fetterman posted on Twitter on Sunday. “If you know her, if she is our neighbor or relative, please, please teach her love instead.”\\nFetterman reiterated those feelings on Monday, saying that she worries the woman could be teaching her grandchildren how to hate others.\\n“She does not reflect the majority and there’s comfort in that,” Fetterman said. “I only love my country more. It just makes me want to fight more for my country.”\\nFetterman said her state police security team is investigating the incident.\\nGov. Tom Wolf released a statement Monday condemning the incident and saying Fettermanhas the “full support” of him and his wife, Frances.\\n“Racism and hate speech are always unacceptable, and unworthy of Pennsylvanians,” Wolf said\\n“No Pennsylvanian should ever be made to feel unwelcome in our commonwealth because of their race or ethnicity,” Wolf added. “Gisele Fetterman spends much of her time devoted to making our state and world a better place and she – and every Pennsylvanian – deserves our respect, not the hatred too often displayed by people who seek only to further divide this country at a time when unity is so desperately needed.\\nJohn Fetterman replied to that tweet with one of his own, saying that he was \"deeply grateful\" to Wolf for supporting his wife.\\nU.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Scranton, posted about the incident on Twitter Sunday night.\\n“Today at the grocery store, PA’s Second Lady @giselefetterman was subjected to a racial slur and taunts. As she said: ‘this hatred is taught.’ It’s on us to teach our children kindness, acceptance and inclusion, and condemn hate whenever and wherever we see it,” Casey wrote.\\nFollow J.D.

       "  'body': 'Scripted TV shows can encourage\\xa0viewers to support\\xa0immigration\\xa0rights, but need to more accurately represent\\xa0immigrants and the issues they face.\\nThose are the key findings of a\\xa0new study, \"Change the Narrative, Change the World,\"\\xa0released Wednesday by Define American and\\xa0USC\\'s Norman Lear Center. It\\xa0finds that undocumented immigrants are portrayed on TV more often than their true numbers suggest, and that the connection between immigrants and crime is overstated.\\nBut the report goes\\xa0beyond on-screen measurement: The survey concludes that the more exposure viewers had\\xa0to immigration-related stories and characters on TV, the more inclusive their attitudes became and the more likely they were to take supportive action.\\n\"The report shows just how much more can be done\" in creating an accurate and nuanced look at immigration, says Jose Antonio Vargas, founder of Define American, an advocacy organization that encourages media to humanize conversations about immigrants.\\xa0\\nBut the study also shows how representation on NBC\\'s \"Superstore\"\\xa0or former CBS drama \"Madam Secretary\"\\xa0– two of three shows\\xa0that received special focus due to their immigration story lines – \"actually fosters\\xa0more inclusive attitudes and beliefs and drives people to create and inspire change wherever they are,\" he says.\\nImmigration divide:Poll shows growing disconnect over Trump\\'s hard-line immigration policies\\nIn the Season 4 finale of \"Superstore,\" which aired in May 2019, Mateo (Nico Santos), a store employee and undocumented immigrant,\\xa0was detained, while \"Secretary,\" which ended its six-season run in December, featured a two-part episode\\xa0about a mother being separated from her young son after crossing the border to seek asylum. A third show highlighted in the study,\\xa0Netflix\\'s \"Orange Is the New Black,\" focused much of its final season on an immigration detention center.\\nThe study, which\\xa0followed up a 2018 report and looked at depictions of 129 immigrant characters in 59 shows between August 2018 and July 2019, found that 63% of the characters with a known immigration status\\xa0were undocumented. That figure is\\xa0substantially higher than the 41% found on TV in the earlier study and more than double the percentage of unauthorized people (24%) among all U.S. immigrants.\\nImmigrants were associated with committing, witnessing or being a victim of a crime in 22% of depictions, a substantial drop from the 2018 study. However, that was still above the level of real-world incidents: \\xa0They commit less crime in general than native-born Americans, the report says, citing research by the Cato Institute and The Marshall Project.\\xa0\\xa0\\nGetting the facts right and portraying immigrants accurately is especially important \"in the most anti-immigrant era in modern American history,\" says Vargas, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who revealed his own undocumented status in a 2011 New York Times Magazine essay. \"In the Trump administration, there is no separation between legal and illegal immigration. Like they just basically said, \\'Nope, we don\\'t want any more immigrants.\\'\"\\nScripted TV shows, in contrast,\\xa0offer \"a really powerful way to reach people and make them understand that this is not\\xa0only a political, partisan piñata, but\\xa0a human issue,\" he says.\\nWhen immigrant characters and story lines are presented with nuance and empathy, Vargas says they\\xa0become more potent and \"can actually shift attitudes and inspire people to (significant) real-life action,\" such as talking to friends\\xa0about the topic, posting on social media or making a donation to a charity.\\n\\xa0Although \"fear-based narratives\"\\xa0can lead some viewers to more inclusive attitudes, they can also backfire, \\xa0particularly among conservative\\xa0or religious viewers who may feel pressured or manipulated, the study found.\\xa0For that reason, it advises against heavy-handed plots.\\nSome troubling\\xa0trends continued in the new report, including an overrepresentation of Middle Eastern immigrants, often in extremist story lines, and an undercount of Asian/Pacific Islanders compared with\\xa0their actual numbers. About half of immigrant characters were Latino, roughly equivalent to real-world percentages. Transgender immigrants, those with disabilities and undocumented Black immigrants were all but invisible on TV.\\nThe 97 episodes analyzed in the study reflected the focus of recent news coverage,\\xa0as the immigration issues most commonly featured\\xa0in story lines were about deportation (29% of episodes) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE (25%).\\nAlthough TV is making strides to portray immigrants more accurately, \"the study shows\\xa0there\\'s absolutely a lot of room to grow,\" Vargas says. \"But when you do it the right way, there\\'s real potential for change.\"\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'SAN FRANCISCO — In 2006, amid the typical post-New Year’s frenzy at Pier 39 — kids spinning on the carousel, the smell of fresh chocolate wafting from candy shops — Immigration Customs and Enforcement officers disrupted the scene. Sarah Souza, then 19, watched on the Spanish-language news channel as agents arrested undocumented workers, burdened with the knowledge that her uncle worked there.\\nThen the image on the screen changed to a picture of her apartment building near Geary Boulevard; agents had learned her uncle lived there. Her uncle’s friend, who had escaped the round up at Pier 39, called Souza and her mother to warn them agents would soon be at their door.\\nThe mother and daughter, undocumented Brazilian immigrants living in a\\xa0one-bedroom apartment, fled. A friend moved their belongings to the basement of the mother’s employer, where they would live for six months.\\nSouza recalls this “frightening” time as her catalyst into political activism.\\n“They treated them like animals,” Souza said. “After that, I had a calling to fight against the system.”\\nSouza now works as an administrative aide at City Hall and leads a local nonprofit that offers social and legal services to low-income Latino immigrants. Her latest role is spearheading one of the more controversial propositions of the upcoming local election: Prop C.\\nThe proposed City Charter amendment would allow noncitizens — including green card holders and undocumented residents — to serve on all city commissions and advisory boards. If it passes, San Francisco will be the first major city in the country to grant noncitizens this ability.\\nIn San Francisco, 35% of residents are foreign-born, hailing from China, the Philippines, Mexico, El Salvador and other countries. Of these, 13.6% are noncitizens, according to Census data, and approximately 35,000 are undocumented.\\nCurrently, only citizens may serve on certain city commissions — including the Immigrant Rights Commission — which craft budgets, advise the mayor and introduce legislation. This prevents representative diversity of the “progressive” sanctuary city, Souza argues, and Prop C is a step toward achieving equity.\\n“We have the lived experience and understand those barriers,” Souza said of the value of an undocumented voice on the Immigrant Rights Commission. “We need political representation, especially when we are facing unprecedented challenges.”\\nDuring the pandemic, immigrants have been among the hardest hit, prompting city leaders to partner with immigrant groups and distribute funds for undocumented residents who did not qualify for federal unemployment or other assistance. They created grassroots testing for Latino residents, who contracted COVID-19 at a disproportionate rate\\xa0citywide.\\nAnother place for noncitizens to contribute to reform is on the Police Commission, said Gabriel Medina, a citizen and the co-leader with Souza of the campaign and fundraising for Proposition C. The commission holds disciplinary hearings when there are charges of police misconduct.\\nActivists point to two incidents within the past five years in advocating for noncitizen representation in those hearings: The fatal police shootings of undocumented Mexican immigrant Luis Góngora Pat and Guatemalan immigrant Amilcar Pérez-López in the Mission District.\\n“We need that aspiring citizen voice to protect (immigrants),” Medina said.\\nAll 11 members on San Francisco’s city council and legislative branch, known as the Board of Supervisors, have voiced support for the amendment. The supervisors have, in the past, supported other noncitizen propositions like Proposition N in 2016, which allowed noncitizen voting in school board elections. While two prior attempts failed, voters passed Prop N by a 54% majority.\\nIvy Zhou, a Chinese immigrant active in school board politics, naturalized in 2016 and will vote for Proposition C.\\n“As residents of San Francisco, you should have the ability to participate in the decision making process,” Zhou said through a translator.\\nProp C is a clear next step to the proposition’s sponsor, Supervisor Shamann Walton, who represents predominantly Black and Asian communities in southeast San Francisco. Walton said the thousands of immigrants living in the city hold stakes in politics regardless of immigration status: noncitizens pay taxes, operate and shop at businesses and enroll their kids in local schools.\\nA 2017 study showed undocumented immigrants in San Francisco contribute $22.8 million in local taxes and $22.6 million in state taxes. A 2018 report found immigrants in the metro area paid $7.8 billion in state and local taxes that year.\\n“In San Francisco, we’re about being inclusive in the political process,” Walton said. “There’s no better way to have folks be represented than to serve in leadership positions.”\\nAnd Souza serves as an example. Now a nearly 20-year resident of San Francisco, she is the first Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals recipient to be an aide to a San Francisco supervisor, Aaron Peskin. Peskin represents District 3, which encompasses Chinatown and the Italian enclave of North Beach\\xa0and has a 41% immigrant population.\\nSouza said her background compelled her to tackle a citywide effort to get more immigrants to fill out the Census, especially because undocumented immigrants are historically undercounted due to mistrust of the government and fear of deportation. So far, the initiative has increased Census participation by 7\\xa0to 10%, according to the Office of Civic Engagement and Immigrant Affairs.\\n“I don’t know if there has been a commission that I haven’t wanted to put Sarah Souza on,” Mission District Supervisor Hillary Ronen said at a virtual town hall for Prop C.\\nBut Souza doesn’t want to stop there. She wants to eventually take a seat on the Immigrant Rights Commission, despite\\xa0being barred from the commission as a noncitizen.\\nAnd local Republican leaders think that’s fair. They disagree with Prop C’s inclusion of “non-legal residents,” asserting political leadership should be for citizens and legal residents.\\nJohn Dennis, chairman of the San Francisco Republican Party, called it “ridiculous,” and “another loopy idea of the Democrats.”\\nSan Franciscans echoed this sentiment in the past. The Board of Supervisors — which included current Gov. Gavin Newsom — unanimously supported an identical proposition that was struck down by 68% of voters\\xa0in 2002.\\nBut that was nearly two decades ago. Souza believes this is the “moment in history” when immigrants can increase political representation.\\n“We want to strengthen our democracy. We must encourage each other to serve,” Souza said.\\nAnnika Hom covers inequality for Mission Local.

In an earlier interview with The Intercept, the doctor confirmed he has treated immigration detainees and said he had performed \"one or two\" hysterectomies on patients in recent years, but said all procedures on immigration detainees are approved by officials at the detention center.\\nAccording to ICE data, two individuals at the Irwin County facility have been referred to medical professionals for hysterectomies since 2018. But in a statement, Dr. Ada Rivera, medical director of the ICE Health Service Corps., said she \"vehemently disputes the implication that detainees are used for experimental medical procedures\" and vowed a full investigation.\\n\"Detainees are afforded informed consent, and a medical procedure like a hysterectomy would never be performed against a detainee’s will,\" the statement said.\\nA hysterectomy is the surgical removal of a woman\\'s uterus, which eliminates any possibility of conceiving a child. Other procedures — including the removal of an ovary or a Fallopian tube — can significantly reduce a woman\\'s chances of conceiving. \\xa0\\nThe whistleblower complaint alleges that immigration detainees were routinely sent outside the detention center to a gynecologist who performed full hysterectomies, partial ones, and other surgical procedures without their full understanding or consent. In one case, Wooten said a detained young woman was supposed to have her left ovary removed because of a cyst but the doctor remover her right ovary instead. The doctor still had to remove the left ovary, Wooten said, leaving the detainee completely infertile.\\n\"She still wanted children — so she has to go back home now and tell her husband that she can\\'t bear kids,\" Wooten said in the complaint.\\nAttorneys representing detainees at the Irwin County Detention Center said they didn’t realize the extent of the problem until they started talking with each other about their clients after the whistleblower complaint was filed. National organizations have since asked attorneys around the country to review their cases and talk to their clients to see if the allegations out of Georgia have been seen elsewhere.\\nSarah Owings, an Atlanta-based immigration attorney, is working with a team of lawyers to identify women who have received medical care from the doctor mentioned in the complaint. By Wednesday, the team had identified more than 15 cases of women who underwent questionable surgeries at the hands of the doctor, including the removal of parts of the Fallopian\\xa0tube and\\xa0removal of the ovaries.\\n\"We are still in the process of comparing notes,\" she said. \"I wouldn’t say there is a systemic pattern, but based on people who have gotten in touch, it points to a lack of informed consent and full understanding by people of these medical treatments.\"\\nBenjamin Osorio, a Virginia immigration attorney, read about the allegations Monday night on a social media site shared by other attorneys and immediately thought of two clients he recently served at the Irwin\\xa0facility.\\nOne of them, Maria Nuñez de Rosales, of El Salvador, was at the facility in 2018 when doctors told her she had cancer and needed a hysterectomy, Osorio said. De Rosales, who only speaks Spanish, had the procedure done without entirely realizing what had happened, he said. De Rosales has since been returned to El Salvador.\\n\"There was no explanation to her and no interpreter,\" Osorio said. \"She woke up and didn’t even know what had happened.\"\\nAnother client, who didn\\'t wish to be named because she\\'s still in removal proceedings, also had a hysterectomy done at the facility, he said. After complaining of abdomen pain, doctors at the center performed a biopsy and told her she had cervical cancer. Amin performed a hysterectomy on her in August 2019, Osorio said. \\xa0\\nAfter leaving the facility, she had a follow-up exam done by her primary doctor in Charlotte, North Carolina, who told her she was cancer-free. Osorio said he doesn\\'t know if the 2019 procedure cleared out the cancer or if his client ever had it in the first place.\\n\"Obviously, there are real questions here: whether this doctor’s giving the best medical advice, if he\\'s getting informed consent,\" Osorio said. \"All these questions are out there. Hopefully, these investigations could figure out what was going on.\"\\nKatie Shepherd, national advocacy counsel with the American Immigration Council, a group that advocates for immigrants and files lawsuits on their behalf, said they\\'re hoping to learn more about the allegations through attorneys because ICE’s historic \"lack of transparency\" makes it hard for them to truly know what’s happening inside immigration detention centers.\\n\"I would not be surprised if there are similar fact patterns in other corners of the ICE detention system,\" she said. \"But obviously we want to learn more.\"\\nU.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., who has been leading the congressional response to the allegations, said the complaint also raises questions about how ICE ensures that detainees consent to medical procedures. She said Homeland Security agents have a long history of forcing immigrants to sign all kinds of documents — dropping immigration court appeals, submitting to voluntary deportations — without having a translator present or fully understanding what they’re signing. Those questionable consent procedures would be even more disturbing, she said, if they led to partial or full hysterectomies.\\n\"I\\'m concerned that the stories that the women tell may be quite different from what the medical records say,\" Jayapal said. \"Even if the medical record says, \\'We did x, y and z,\\' if the women haven\\'t been informed or much less consented to (a procedure), where they don’t have any clue what they’re signing…that is significant.\"\\nA 2019 USA TODAY investigation into the federal government’s increasing use of private prison companies and local jails to house civil immigration detainees revealed systemic problems in the medical care provided to those detainees. An analysis of inspection reports highlighted problems at several facilities and court documents showed multi-million dollar settlements paid to detainees who were mistreated while in custody.\\nMost of the complaints focused on a lack of access to medical care, with one detainee saying her breast cancer returned after she was unable to get cancer medication while in custody and a civil rights organization creating a specialized medical team to respond to the growing medical complaints from ICE detainees.\\n\"People who need life-saving medical treatment don’t get the care they deserve,\" said Lorilei Williams, a senior staff attorney for the Southeast Immigrant Freedom Initiative in Georgia.\\xa0\"But it is interesting we have seen a lot of folks who receive gynecological care.\"\\nImmigrant attorneys and advocates have been flagging concerns about medical mistreatment at the Irwin center for years. The center is located in Ocilla, Georgia, a city of roughly\\xa03,000\\xa0residents almost 200 miles south of Atlanta. It housed about 650 detainees under ICE custody as of Sept. 8.\\nIn April, a group of eight medically vulnerable detainees at the Irwin detention center and\\xa0the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia, sued DHS claiming a lack of medical care and deplorable conditions at these facilities made them vulnerable to COVID-19. The people named in the lawsuit, filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center, had preexisting medical conditions, including diabetes, high blood pressure and asthma, among other conditions.\\nThey described living in very close quarters that made social distancing and recommended hygiene measures impossible. The conditions were described as \"flagrantly unsanitary and dangerous to the health of detained individuals.\"\\nAt Irwin, detainees said they were punished if they requested medical attention, sometimes by being placed in solitary confinement, according to the lawsuit. One man at Irwin reported that a guard told him \"medical staff would only take him to the hospital if they see him dying.\"\\nOthers said that the Irwin center lacks a medical alert system to notify guards of an emergency. The lawsuit also claims that a 2017 inspection of the facility found that medical unit cells were so dirty, that \"floors need to be mopped, walls wiped down, toilets cleaned, and trash and refuse removed.\"\\nFollow Jervis, Gomez and Clark on Twitter: @MrRJervis, @alangomez, @MariaPClark1.\\xa0\\n'},\n",

In\\xa0the past, immigrant children were\\xa0transferred to state-licensed supervised shelters and provided a chance to apply for asylum.\\n\\'Be vigilant\\':Hotel group condemns Trump administration\\'s use of hotels to hold migrant kids\\nGee ruled\\xa0Sept. 4 that the government\\'s detention of\\xa0children longer than 72 hours violated the\\xa0decades-old Flores\\xa0settlement that governs the treatment of immigrant children in custody. She\\xa0had ordered the Trump administration to stop holding immigrant children in hotels as part of the policy by Sept. 15, with limited exceptions, but the practice has continued while the Trump administration sought stays pending an appeal.\\nA review of federal court records by The Arizona Republic\\xa0shows that\\xa0a total of 660 immigrant children were held at 26 hotels between April 18 and July 31 as part of\\xa0a Trump administration policy to expel undocumented immigrants rapidly. The hotels were located in Phoenix; in El Paso, McAllen, Pharr, Houston and San Antonio, Texas; and in Alexandria, Louisiana, court records show.\\nOf the 660, 577 of the children were minors not accompanied by\\xa0parents.\\nThe data was included in court records filed by the National Center for Youth Law and the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, plaintiffs\\xa0in the Flores settlement case, based on data provided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. An analysis by the National Center for Youth Law of the ICE data provided by ICE found several inconsistencies, including discrepancies in the\\xa0dates some children were held in hotels and more alarmingly discrepancies in which cities\\xa0they\\xa0were held, court records show.\\n“The fact that the government cannot seem to consistently keep track of how many children it has held in its custody is disturbing, to put it mildly. It is emblematic of the problem with such an opaque, unregulated, ad hoc program,” Gee wrote in the Sept. 21 order.\\nThe children ranged in age from 3 months to 17 years and were held in hotels as long as 29 days\\xa0by a private contractor, MVM Inc., working for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, court records show.\\nMany of the immigrant children held in hotels during that period have already been expelled, the records show.\\nThe court records show that more hotels in Phoenix were used to hold immigrant children than was previously known. They also show\\xa0how many children were held in each hotel.\\nOf the 660 immigrant children held in hotels,\\xa0124 were held at three hotels in Phoenix.\\xa0\\nOf the 124 immigrant children held at hotels in Phoenix, the vast majority, 121, were\\xa0held at the Hampton Inn Phoenix-Airport North hotel on 44th Street near Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. That is the second highest number of children held at any one hotel during that period, according to the court records.\\nTwo immigrant children were held at the Crown Plaza Phoenix Airport hotel on Washington Street during that period, the records show, and one child was held at an unnamed hotel in Phoenix listed in court records only as \"hotel.\"\\nPreviously, it was only known that immigrant children were held at the Hampton Inn Phoenix-Airport North hotel. The number of children held there also previously was not known.\\nThe 121 immigrant children held at the Hampton Inn Phoenix-Airport North was the second highest total behind the Hampton Inn and Suites in McAllen, where a total of 339 immigrant children were held during that period, court records show.\\nOwners of the Hampton Inn Phoenix-Airport North and the Crown Plaza Phoenix Airport hotels did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\nPhoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, a critic of\\xa0holding immigrant children in hotels,\\xa0said the 124 immigrant children held\\xa0in Phoenix shows the scope of the program is larger than the federal government has acknowledged.\\n\"I\\'ve spoken to the federal government and they claimed this was a very small program. Your reporting indicates that it\\'s much larger than I was led to believe,\" Gallego said.\\nGallego wrote to Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf asking for information about the program after the Associated Press first reported that hotels in Phoenix, El Paso and McAllen Texas had been used to hold immigrant children.\\nWolf said during a Senate hearing in August that the practice of holding immigrant children in hotels was ongoing and said DHS officials would provide information about the practice to Phoenix officials. That has not happened, Gallego said.\\n\"This is a very significant program and we are not getting the information we need.\\xa0Given the magnitude of the program it could look like human trafficking,\" Gallego said. \"The hotels are not set up to provide the necessary security for children including accountability of who enters their rooms when they are alone.\\n\"Children should be kept in facilities that were designed for this purpose,\" Gallego said. She noted that there are state-licensed facilities that have been used to house immigrant children in the past available in Phoenix.\\nThe facilities \"had many beds open during this time period. I\\'m very concerned about this program. It needs to end,\" Gallego said.\\nOwners of the Hampton Inn Phoenix-Airport North and the Hampton Inn and Suites in McAllen where the bulk of the immigrant children were held early have said they have ended contracts and had stopped allowing immigrant children to be held at the two hotels.\\nThe total number of immigrant children who have been held in hotels since the Trump administration implemented the emergency COVID-19 policy\\xa0is not known.\\n\"The government’s detention of children in unlicensed and unmonitored hotels presents a significant risk of harm to these children, as children are supervised by private contractors who do not have licensure or appropriate training in children’s development, trauma, or legal rights,\" said Melissa Adamson, an attorney at the National Center for Youth Law.\\n\"The government’s detention of children in unlicensed and unmonitored hotels is particularly egregious given that there are over 10,000 available licensed beds in ORR shelters,\" she said.\\nAt least 147,601 immigrants\\xa0who arrived at the southern border without documents have been expelled under the policy, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. Of those,\\xa0least 8,800 immigrant children have been expelled, court records show.\\nIn denying the Trump administration\\'s request for a stay, Gee, the judge, rejected the Trump administration\\'s argument that holding immigrant children in\\xa0hotels to expel them quickly protected the public and others from the spread of COVID-19 at state-licensed facilities operated under contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement.\\nHolding immigrant children in hotels, on the contrary, poses just as much a risk, while also exposing children to unsupervised and potentially traumatic conditions, Gee wrote.\\xa0\\n\"Defendants have failed to demonstrate how hotels, which are otherwise open to the public and have unlicensed staff coming in and out, located in areas with high incidence of COVID-19, are any better for protecting public health than licensed facilities would be.” Gee wrote, citing the Sept. 4 order.\\xa0\"Not only are the minors and their families potentially endangered by hoteling, but so are (ICE contract)\\xa0personnel, hotel staff, and other guests that stay at the hotels.\"\\nReach the reporter at daniel.gonzalez@arizonarepublic.com or at 602-444-8312.

       "  'body': 'This presidential election season joins the last several in being attended by accusations that certain candidates are ineligible because of the requirement in Article II of the Constitution that the president be not only a citizen, but a “natural born” citizen. This time around, some have claimed that Sen.\\xa0Kamala Harris is ineligible for\\xa0the presidency because, though born in the United States, her parents were immigrants who had not become citizens by the time of her birth.\\xa0\\nWe believe this claim is untenable.\\xa0But the need to address the matter at all\\xa0highlights why eligibility distinctions that turn on place of birth or status of parent ought to be abolished.\\xa0That eligibility for our highest political office is conditioned by an invidious discrimination buried in the Constitution itself\\xa0should be highly disturbing.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn 2016, the targets were Republican\\xa0candidates Ted Cruz\\xa0(born in Canada to U.S.-citizen parents who had immigrated from Cuba) and Marco Rubio (also the son of Cuban immigrants). In 2008 and 2012, Barack Obama, was assailed by “birthers” who falsely claimed he was born outside the United States. Obama\\'s 2008 GOP opponent, John McCain, came under attack because he was born in what was then the Panama Canal Zone. Such episodes are all too likely to recur.\\xa0In an increasingly diverse society, it will often be possible to claim tendentiously that some candidate or other is ineligible.\\xa0\\nSen.\\xa0Tammy Duckworth’s stock as a potential running mate for Joe Biden reportedly declined\\xa0in part because of concerns that there might be litigation over her eligibility since she was born in Thailand to an American-citizen father and a Thai mother. The incident illustrates how even a highly dubious accusation of ineligibility can derail a potentially promising nominee\\nBarring naturalized citizens from eligibility for the presidency is little different from discrimination based on race, ethnicity\\xa0or gender. Such unchosen circumstances of birth say nothing about a person\\'s competence or moral fitness for\\xa0office. Our legal system rejects the natural born requirement elsewhere. It does not apply to governors, members of Congress, justices of the Supreme Court, cabinet officers, or\\xa0the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It should be removed as a condition for eligibility for the presidency.\\xa0\\nAlthough the history of the natural born citizenship requirement is murky, its adoption probably stemmed from fear of skulduggery by European royalty who might seek election to the presidency.\\xa0This concern,\\xa0overblown in the 1780s, is even\\xa0less plausible today.\\nThe most obvious objection to letting immigrants ascend to the presidency is concern that they might be less loyal\\xa0to the nation than native-born citizens.\\xa0But there is no good reason to think that people who became Americans by choice are less likely to be loyal than those who did so merely by accident of birth.\\nOur American stories:\\xa0Like Kamala Harris, I\\'m the daughter of an Indian immigrant.\\nIf the issue is that immigrant-citizens might have a conflict of interest by virtue of economic or social connections abroad, the same issue can arise with natural-born citizens, as witness the numerous conflicts arising from Donald Trump’s business dealings.\\xa0The appropriate solution is to impose uniform conflict-of-interest rules that apply equally to all regardless of origins.\\nSome may fear\\xa0that immigrants have less knowledge of American society than their native-born peers. But that concern is addressed satisfactorily by the Article II requirement that to be president a person must be 35 years of age and a resident within the United States for 14 years.\\nThe constitutional amendment needed to repeal the natural born citizen requirement will be difficult to enact. Any amendment is an uphill struggle because of the required hurdle of securing two-thirds majorities in both houses of Congress, and ratification by three-fourths of state legislatures. This amendment would also face headwinds because of strong anti-immigrant sentiment on the political right. But things might well change as the current political moment passes, xenophobia recedes (polls\\xa0show younger voters are much more supportive of immigration than older ones), and more people come to realize how ridiculous this restriction is. At the very least, Americans may get tired of hearing this claptrap every four years.\\nCitizens who can be kicked out:Donald Trump\\'s denaturalization task force is a new way to threaten the American Dream\\nFavoring the\\xa0amendment is the fact that supporters hail from across the political spectrum.\\xa0The two of us come from very different backgrounds and have widely divergent ideological views. But we agree that the time has come to put an end to this wrongful exclusion.\\xa0\\nWe are not alone. Robert Post, former dean of\\xa0the Yale Law School\\xa0and a strong liberal, denounced the requirement stirringly: “[A]t the very heart of the constitutional order, in the Office of the President, the Constitution abandons its brave experiment of forging a new society based upon principles of voluntary commitment; it instead gropes for security among ties of blood and contingencies of birth.” So, too, did former Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a strong conservative. Proposing a 2003 amendment to abolish the clause, he described it as\\xa0an “unfounded inequity” and\\xa0“an anachronism that is decidedly un-American.” He was right.\\xa0\\nRandall Kennedy is the Michael R.

You want to turn away as it\\'s going on, it will definitely bother you, and that\\'s kind of the point Doucouré is making. In her artistic way, she\\'s imploring moms and dads to pay attention to your kids and what they\\'re watching and taking in as influences at such a formative age.\\n\"Cuties\" is a movie with kids but it\\'s not for kids. It has way more artistic merit than several seasons of \"Toddlers & Tiaras.\" (Did we all just forget that happened?) Watch it if you want, don\\'t watch if you don\\'t, but its politicization is unfortunate for something that does actually have good intentions at its core.\\xa0\\nWith raging wildfires and a pandemic that doesn\\'t feel like it\\'s ending any time soon, \"Cuties\" doesn\\'t seem like our biggest problem as a nation.

After spending his entire adult life dispatching squealers with guns, ropes and ice picks, Reles, fearing for his own life, turns state’s evidence.\\nThe snitch carries the hopes of many a cop: “Reles was the keystone, the Jenga piece, in a government push to end once and for all the mob’s long-reaching free hand in murder, racketeering, extortion, loan-sharking, drug-smuggling, prostitution, and gambling.”\\nBut, as Cannell writes in a tome rife with indelible detail, “The police took up a saying, ‘The canary sang but he could not fly.’” Before Reles can continue testifying against his murderous bosses, he winds up exiting, against his will, his police-protected hotel room through the window, instantly rendering the canary’s voice mute.\\nFrom this cinematic opening trained on an unsolved mystery – “Who killed Kid Twist?” – Cannell hits rewind, bringing readers into the hardscrabble New York of the 1920s. There, Reles and countless other immigrant kids of various ethnicities and religious backgrounds find a protective brotherhood in gangs that demand loyalty unconditionally and punish betrayal mercilessly.\\nWe also meet the law enforcement officers bent on leveraging underlings and executioners such as Reles to put Mob kingpins behind bars. Chief among them is a name from a historic cliche: Thomas Dewey, perhaps best known for the famously erroneous election year headline held up by President Harry Truman, “Dewey defeats Truman.”\\nFar from a one-line joke, Dewey was a righteous and crusading Midwesterner who as top prosecutor (and later governor) of New York helped put away Mob boss Charles “Lucky” Luciano and was relentless in his pursuit of various criminal factions.\\nSeeing Dewey in this new light is part of the revelatory appeal of “A Brotherhood Betrayed,” which takes a detour off the well-trod path that is Mafia nonfiction. Where most books on organized crime immediately conjure images of Francis Ford Coppola’s “The Godfather,” Cannell’s is more “On the Waterfront” as Reles and his cohorts often plied their brutal trade to keep waterfront union leaders from organizing.\\nWhat Cannell brings to this lurid banquet of a story is meticulous research and writing flair, the same winning combination that animated past books on the 1961 Formula One racing season (“The Limit”) and a mad bomber who terrorized New York (“Incendiary”).\\nOf an interview between prosecutor Dewey and a Mob madam brought into custody for questioning, Cannell relays her first-hand fears: “If I talked, they’d slit my throat,” (she) told Dewey. “God, how I hope you get them. If you don’t, it’s curtains for me. They’ll grab me the minute I’m out of here.”\\nIf not before, as Kid Twist found out somewhere along his newsmaking plunge from sixth-floor “Rat Suite” to gravel roof of the hotel’s kitchen annex.\\nThree weeks after Reles’ death, Pearl Harbor was attacked by Japanese fighter pilots. America’s priorities changed overnight. What Cannell has frozen in sparkling amber is a New York, and indeed a nation, from a century ago. It’s a fascinating and punishing place worth visiting from the comforts of a self-quarantined reading nook, if in part to distract us from the assaults of 2020.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Ruben Garcia, the head football coach and athletic director at Falfurrias High School in Falfurrias, Texas,\\xa0didn’t think much of the small group chat he created.\\nThe collection of\\xa0Hispanic high school head football coaches, assistant coaches and athletic administrators in Texas\\xa0was meant to help each other make connections, share coaching tips and football strategies.\\nThe GroupMe chat that started with less than 20 peers in 2018\\xa0is now a coalition of 700 strong.\\xa0\\n\"I didn\\'t realize there was that many Hispanics out there coaching, you know\\xa0coaching in general,\" said\\xa0Armando Jacinto, the first president of the organization and the Spring Independent School District assistant athletic director.\\xa0\\nThe feeling of surprise is warranted among the members of the newly formed Hispanic Texas High School Football Coaches Association (TXHSFB). Not only in high school football, but every level of the sport.\\xa0\\nEven though Hispanic people are the largest minority in the country, according to\\xa0the\\xa0United States Census Bureau, they are severely underrepresented when it comes to the Power Five conferences in college football and the NFL.\\nAnthony\\xa0Muñoz reached the pinnacle of football in his career as the second Mexican-American inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. But he didn\\'t see many\\xa0who looked like him on the way there.\\n\"I don\\'t know, it\\'s really interesting because they are such big fans of the game and there\\'s not more\\xa0participating,\"\\xa0Muñoz said.\\xa0\\nIn 2018-19, 417 of 15,710 (2.7%)\\xa0Division I FBS players\\xa0identified as Hispanic/Latino, according to\\xa0the TIDES College Sport Racial and Gender Report Card. In the same year,\\xa0eight players out of 1,357 (0.5%)\\xa0identified as Hispanic or Latino in the NFL.\\nWith National Hispanic Heritage Month ending Thursday, USA TODAY Sports spoke to several players and coaches to pose the question: Why are there so few Hispanics in big-time college football, which is often the path to the NFL?\\nMike Garcia, a\\xa0founding member\\xa0of TXHSFB, wasn’t raised on football, but that didn’t stop him from winning a national championship with the\\xa0University of Texas as an offensive lineman in 2005.\\n“Personally, I didn\\'t grow up knowing really what football was,” said Garcia, who was raised on\\xa0the east side of Houston.\\xa0“As a\\xa0Hispanic kid, I grew up watching basketball, and I grew up watching soccer and playing soccer.”\\nGarcia\\xa0was hesitant to play football as a freshman in high school\\xa0but eventually grew to flourish\\xa0and began to admire players that came before him\\xa0— like\\xa0Muñoz,\\xa0an offensive lineman with the Cincinnati Bengals for 13 years and an 11-time Pro Bowl player.\\nMuñoz wasn’t as new to football as Garcia, but like many Hispanic children, football wasn’t\\xa0at the forefront of his upbringing.\\n“My mom had to learn about the game, I had relatives that were learning about football, where\\xa0baseball and sports like that, there was a lot of knowledge already there,” Muñoz said.\\nSome experts say the lack of Hispanic people in football is much more than a cultural barrier, however. Mario Longoria and Jorge Iber, co-authors of the book \"Latinos in American Football,\" both said\\xa0that Hispanic people are extremely family oriented and even though that is not necessarily a negative trait, it could be a factor in the low numbers of Hispanic players in big-time college football.\\n“Culture is not a deterrent,” Longoria said. “The only difference between the Latino and the White Anglo is the thought process. Latinos are always collective thinkers before they make a decision to do anything \\xad— they include their family and their extended family. Gringos are more individualists. If they\\'re going to do something and anybody gets in their way, they\\'re going to run all over you. Whether that\\'s good or bad, I guess is a matter of opinion.”\\nPoverty is a major roadblock — especially\\xa0in minority groups — for high school graduates\\xa0attending\\xa0college. In the U.S., the Hispanic population has the third-highest poverty rate at 17.6%, according to\\xa0Poverty USA in 2018, behind African Americans (20.8%) and Native Americans (25.4%).\\xa0\\nMarcus Arroyo, in his first season as head coach at UNLV after serving as offensive coordinator at Oregon, knows for some Hispanic people\\xa0going to college can be difficult because of a family-first mindset. He has seen cases of family hardship\\xa0while on the recruiting trail.\\n“I literally heard someone say, ‘I can\\'t go to school because I have to get a job. I have to go make more money to support my family,’” said Arroyo, who is one of just a handful of Hispanic head coaches of a Division I FBS program. He adds that in his experience the recruits who suffer from financial hardships are predominantly from minority communities.\\nDanny Gonzales, the head football coach at the University of New Mexico, recalled that he had multiple friends and teammates immediately join the workforce after high school in order to help provide for their families. His\\xa0father\\xa0dropped out of college to help his grandfather run his family’s auto shop as well.\\nIber referenced Texas and California as two major hot spots for Hispanic immigrants, and that going as far back as the 1930s,\\xa0Hispanic children would forgo college and football to work in the fields to support their families.\\nHe sees the pattern today in meat processing plants and other industries where immigrants make up a bulk of the workforce. Iber, the associate dean for student affairs at Texas Tech, said these sons of immigrant workers are just now beginning to see greener pastures, though.\\n\"For some, they are able to move into that lower middle-class, they\\'re getting these kids into school and beginning to play football,\" Iber said. \"But it took a while to get to that point. It\\'s a 100-year process.\"\\nSergio Gonzalez, another founding member of TXHSFB, was in eighth grade when he first realized he was different. Gonzalez was attending a football camp\\xa0when a coach approached him.\\n“You’re pretty good for a little Mexican kid,” the coach said.\\nGonzalez\\xa0asked his father what the coach meant.\\xa0\\n“Well son, look around, how many kids look like you in these camps or on your team?” Gonzalez’s father said.\\nGarcia said\\xa0on multiple occasions he has heard the\\xa0slur \"Itty Bitty Mexican\" in football circles and one instance specifically struck him. While at a coach’s clinic, Garcia recalled that a Black coach jokingly said that he “had a bunch of IBMs” on his offensive line.\\nGarcia\\xa0approached the coach afterwards to express\\xa0how comments like that can have a profound effect on young players.\\n“As a Hispanic who\\'s\\xa0coached other Hispanics, who grew up playing football with non-Hispanic coaches, if I was to hear this from one of my coaches, it would definitely make me doubt that you as my coach had my best interests in your heart,” Garcia said.\\nLongoria and Iber said they believe the stereotype\\xa0that Hispanic people are smaller physically than other ethnicities\\xa0has impeded many young players when trying to get recruited by college programs.\\xa0\\nLos Angeles Chargers cornerback Michael Davis, who is half Mexican, has heard his share of\\xa0jabs at his Hispanic heritage.\\xa0\\n\"‘Oh, you’re Hispanic? Then maybe you should just kick the ball,’ \" Davis recalled being told. \"There aren’t any obvious obstacles facing Hispanic players, but especially in a league like the NFL, everyone is predominantly Black or white, with just a handful of Hispanic players out there. So maybe some people look at Hispanic players differently, like, ‘Can you actually play?\\'”\\nEven Ron Rivera, head coach of the Washington NFL team,\\xa0has dealt with insensitive jokes. Rivera is just the third Latino to become a head coach in the NFL, but before that he was the only Latino on the University of California football team.\\xa0\\n\"Some of the jokes that they would tell really got to me,\" Rivera said of his days as a young player.\\xa0\"So certain things became personal to me. It was almost one of those things that drove me. It really did. I took some of it personal because it just makes you want to prove everyone wrong.”\\nNearly a decade ago,\\xa0Muñoz partnered with the NFL in an effort to get more Hispanic children involved in football.\\xa0These \"character camps\" are geared toward not only teaching Hispanic children about football, but also teaching teamwork and respect.\\xa0\\nThe camps travel across the country to spread the love of football throughout Latin communities, and despite\\xa0Muñoz seeing the excitement in Hispanic children to play football, there\\'s still significant work to be done.\\nThe amount of players who identified as Hispanic/Latino\\xa0— not just in the FBS\\xa0— but in all of Division I football decreased in 2019 from 3.2% to 3.0%, according to the TIDES report.\\xa0\\nNaturally, the top high school prospects in the country are recruited to Power Five\\xa0programs and even in high school, Hispanic representation is small. According to Rivals, there are only two players with Hispanic surnames listed in the top 100 recruits of the 2021 class.\\nThere is a shortage of Hispanic high school coaches as well. The\\xa0TXHSFB\\'s mission is to not only provide a space for networking and sharing\\xa0coaching tips, but to help more Hispanic coaches ascend Texas\\' competitive coaching ladder.\\nThe founding members of\\xa0TXHSFB say\\xa0coaches from all across the country have reached out in attempts to not only join the organization, but\\xa0for help creating\\xa0their own statewide groups.\\nHistory may remember Gonzalez\\'s once small group chat as the beginning of a movement for Hispanic people in football.\\xa0\\n\"I think we ignited a fire,\" Gonzalez said.\\n'},\n",

But, annoyingly, Catholic voters are expected to embrace only a subset of the issues that motivate us and overlook anti-Catholic bigotry in candidates\\'\\xa0records that occurred when they were\\xa0outside of the election spotlight.\\nAs a Catholic, the issue central to my evaluation of every candidate is a matter of life and death —\\xa0abortion. My challenge to fellow Catholics is to consider this carefully.\\nThe\\xa0science of\\xa0the development of human\\xa0life\\xa0and the many\\xa0harms of abortion\\xa0for women and the preborn should be enough for us to react in horror to the loss of more than 60 million\\xa0Americans\\xa0since\\xa0Roe v. Wade\\xa0and\\xa0Doe v. Bolton\\xa0wiped out legal protections\\xa0for life in the womb. But for some of us, faith is an additional incentive to protect the least of these.\\xa0\\nAs Pope Francis has said, “The right to life is the first among human rights.”\\xa0This truth is central to\\xa0Catholic teaching\\xa0throughout time.\\xa0Psalm 139:13-14 notes: “For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb.\\xa0I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.”\\nFaith does not intrude into politics on abortion. Instead, political operatives forced into the law and public policy an irreverent rejection of the value of preborn life.\\xa0\\nRather than helping pregnant women, abortion proponents attempt\\xa0to eliminate the child, a potential sufferer, rather than the woman\\'s\\xa0suffering.

The act of abortion ends\\xa0the life of her child\\xa0and offers nothing in return.\\xa0\\nShoddy, dangerous care:I was an abortionist.

Getting rid of the\\xa0Hyde Amendment\\xa0— former Vice President Joe Biden\\'s position\\xa0—\\xa0means support for taxpayer funding of abortion. Eliminating the\\xa0Mexico City policy\\xa0means taxpayer funding of abortion worldwide. \"Medicare for All\" could\\xa0equal\\xa0forcing abortion coverage into all health care.\\nThe tragic passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a clear reminder of the ever present issue of judicial appointments as a reason to vote for those who want to see life protected in law.\\xa0\\nBut believers like myself have\\xa0also been very troubled by political trends of “allowing” Catholics access to political opportunity only if they don’t support all that is taught.\\nIn hearings of multiple recent\\xa0judicial nominees,\\xa0senators\\xa0— including the Democrats\\' vice presidential nominee,\\xa0Kamala Harris\\xa0—\\xa0attacked candidates like Judge\\xa0Amy Coney Barrett, who is on President Donald Trump\\'s\\xa0short list for the Supreme Court, for actually believing\\xa0the tenets of their church.\\xa0Harris\\xa0has a troubling record.\\xa0While attorney general of California, Harris\\xa0arranged for an armed\\xa0raid\\xa0on the home of pro-life journalist and activist David Daleiden, who had dared to document\\xa0Planned Parenthood employees\\'\\xa0engagement in exchanging money for\\xa0aborted infant body parts,\\xa0and she did this after advocating for\\xa0Planned Parenthood as part of her\\xa0Senate campaign.\\xa0Her abortion platform while running for president included\\xa0using the Department of Justice\\xa0against states that attempt to pass pro-life laws.\\nNot a laughing matter:Hey HBO, abortion isn\\'t a joke\\nLast year,\\xa0Harris introduced\\xa0the\\xa0Do No Harm Act in the U.S. Senate, which would water down\\xa0the federal 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, among other laws designed to protect people of faith. In effect, that change would empower governmental authorities to force people of faith to comply with laws they find morally objectionable, such as pay for or perform abortions in health care if they receive some state or federal funding.\\nThis is not a small threat as\\xa0twice the nuns of the Little Sisters of the Poor\\xa0have been forced to go to the Supreme Court because they did not want to pay for birth control and abortions,\\xa0or provide insurance coverage for contraceptives.\\nChristian case for Biden:Christian conservatives like me should not let abortion and socialism scare us off Biden\\nA common canard thrown at pro-life people is the falsehood that\\xa0we don’t care\\xa0about the baby\\xa0after he or she is born.

This is their team and it’s the only team they have ever known.\\nWhen I left the Republican Party after the 2016 election, there was no Lincoln Project waiting to embrace me. It would be another four years before that pirate ship would set sail. In recent months, I’ve had a fair number of people tell me that if the Lincoln Project had existed four years ago, maybe that’s where they would have ended up instead of still serving a master who\\xa0makes them cringe.\\nThey were not willing to gamble with the uncertainty that I confronted at the\\xa0dawn of Trumpism. Candidly, I had no idea where my next paycheck was going to come from. I lived off my credit card. Fell into debt. The professional network of Republican operatives, consultants\\xa0and lobbyists I had spent a decade of my life in Washington cultivating was now gone.\\nThis is the conundrum that keeps so many people locked in place, working for a political party that is no longer recognizable to them. The people I’ve talked to have spouses, kids, mortgages, financial responsibilities that won’t just evaporate. Like most people, they act out of self-interest and necessity.\\nIn recent weeks, COVID-19 has swept across the upper echelon of the Republican Party, infecting everyone from the president of the United States to the chair of the Republican National Committee. Three U.S. senators, Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien, outside advisers like Chris Christie, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany and two of her deputies have all tested positive for the coronavirus.\\nTo those who have resisted acting out of conscience and continue to prop up this radicalized incarnation of the Republican Party, to this point, I understand. I disagree with you, but having walked that path of uncertainty for many years, I know why you’ve allowed that fear to hijack your conscience. But the time has now come to act, not just out of conscience and the common good, but out of self-interest as well.\\nDangerous president:Trump made it hard for me to protect America. How could I vote for him again? How could anyone?\\nWe know that the White House knew about senior adviser Hope Hicks’ positive coronavirus test before a fundraising event in New Jersey took place, but, though he was in close proximity to her, without wearing a mask, Trump and his top aides allowed the event to move forward, thereby risking exposure to everyone who attended the event. On Thursday, we learned that the White House outbreak was larger than first reported, with 34 staffers contracting the coronavirus.\\nAnyone who might have been hoping that the president’s run-in with COVID-19 would sober him up to the recklessness of his conduct and rhetoric was once again sorely disappointed. Tweeting last week before he left Walter Reed hospital on Oct. 5, Trump declared, “Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life…I feel better than I did 20 years ago!” Upon his return to the\\xa0White House,\\xa0Trump defiantly removed his mask and said\\xa0in a video:\\xa0“I know there’s a risk, there’s a danger, but that’s OK.”\\nA week later he was back on the campaign trail at a Sanford, Florida rally where his fans sat and stood shoulder to shoulder, without social distancing, and many did not wear masks. \"I’m very young and I’m in such perfect shape,\" Trump said, and suggested he would kiss everyone in the audience.\\nThe White House entourage is considered so high-risk\\xa0that some\\xa0news organizations are refusing to travel with Trump, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week he hasn\\'t been to the White House since early August due to lax COVID rules.\\xa0\\nTo my former Republican colleagues, I ask you, is working for Trump worth your own life or the lives of your spouse, children\\xa0and loved ones? It doesn’t matter what job you get next, what contract you land, what promotion you’re up for, if you’re dead.\\nThink about it. Those\\xa0you serve\\xa0have knowingly put you in harm’s way. They don’t care about your health. They don’t care about your life. Knowing what they know now, they would gladly sacrifice your well-being again. To them, you are invisible. You are replaceable. You are disposable.\\nTainting the nation with incivility:Trump hasn’t \\'saved Christianity\\' and Christians shouldn’t save his presidency\\nGo home tonight and find the people you hold most dear, look at them, talk to them, Zoom with them. Ask them, how would their lives change if you were no longer in theirs. Take an inventory of what they say. How they make you feel. Now ask yourself if the people you go to work with, who you report to, who you answer to, make you feel the same way. Ask yourself if the president you serve would even notice if you were suddenly gone from the face of this Earth.\\nYou weren’t willing to quit and speak out for the good of our country. Are you willing to do it for the good of your own health and life?\\nKurt Bardella is\\xa0a senior adviser for The Lincoln Project and a member of USA Today’s Board of Contributors.

Ron DeSantis and Secretary of State Laurel Lee for even more time, said they would not be filing an appeal:\\xa0\"With the election fast approaching, our clients are shifting their focus to getting their communities out to vote.\"\\nMore:Federal judge weighs arguments in lawsuit over Florida voter registration system crash\\nThousands of voters likely were barred from voting in November by Monday\\'s online malfunction, Walker\\xa0said, but\\xa0\"the state’s interest in preventing chaos in its already precarious—and perennially chaotic—election outweighs the substantial burden imposed on the right to vote.\"\\nHe called Lee\\'s extension a \"half measure\" with at least one major flaw —\\xa0she didn\\'t notify the public until after noon on Tuesday.\\n\"This left less than seven hours for potential voters to somehow become aware of the news and ensure that they properly submitted their voter registration applications, all while also participating in their normal workday, school, family, and caregiving responsibilities,\" Walker said.\\nHis biting conclusion: Walker noted that \"every man who has stepped foot on the Moon launched from the Kennedy Space Center, in Florida. Yet, Florida has failed to figure out how to run an election properly — a task simpler than rocket science.\"\\nThe coalition of progressive interest\\xa0groups\\xa0— including Dream Defenders, Florida Immigrant Coalition, New Florida Majority and\\xa0Organize Florida — wanted to extend the deadline by another two days.\\n\"Our view is that the judge generally recognized what the situation is, and the failure of the online registration system,\" Naifeh said. \"He\\xa0chalked up his decision to the state\\'s past incompetence and not wanting to rely on the state to correct this.\"\\nBrad Ashwell, Florida director for All Voting is Local, an advocacy group that was not involved in the case, called the ruling a big setback for voters.\\xa0\\nDeSantis and Lee \"knew the website’s tendency to crash posed a danger to democracy, yet they did nothing,\" Ashwell said. \"They had years of warnings but chose not to act ... their dereliction of duty is beyond inappropriate and inexcusable.\"\\nFlorida law\\xa0establishes the deadline for registration as 29 days before the general election, which in this case was 11:59 p.m. Monday. Potential voters who tried accessing the RegisterToVoteFlorida.gov website encountered error messages,\\xa0were unable to complete applications, and thus could not register.\\xa0\\nWalker also had to weigh\\xa0whether he could rule on election law in the middle of an election cycle, especially so close to the election date.\\xa0\\n\"This case would be much different if the question before this Court solely dealt with the (Oct.\\xa05)\\xa0crash; if Defendant Lee had not extended the deadline, granting a preliminary injunction would give this Court little pause,\" Walker said.\\nHaving only raw numbers comparing registration in 2018 to 2020, Walker concluded that \"a significant number of potential voters were barred from registering even with the extension\" and constituted a \"substantial burden limiting the right to vote.\"\\nBut the state\\'s interest in \"conducting an efficient and orderly election\" counts even more, he concluded. Any surge in new voters due to an extended registration deadline might not show up in the poll books, and they would have to submit a provisional ballot, slowing the process at the polling places.\\nWalker repeatedly took the state to task for failing its citizens, yet again. Since the online registration system went live in 2017, it has crashed at least five times during high volume\\xa0before pending book closing deadlines, and during the National Voter Registration Day.\\n\"In this case, potential voters attempted to perform their civic duty, to exercise their fundamental right, only to be thwarted, once again, by a state that seemingly is never prepared for an election,\" Walker said.\\xa0\"Unfortunately for these potential voters, this Court cannot remedy what the state broke under these circumstances.\"\\nContact Jeff Schweers at jschweers@gannett.com and follow him on Twitter @jeffschweers.\\n'},\n",

Experts say what many of us are experiencing is \"disaster fatigue.\"\\xa0\\n\"It\\'s a sense, essentially, of psychological overwhelm,\" said Patrick Hardy, a certified emergency manager and risk manager. \"You\\'re being constantly bombarded with negative information. ... It creates this sense of doom.\"\\nWhen disasters occur sequentially, it can make it seem as though our problems are insurmountable. It\\'s getting worse and worse, we think. It\\'s never going to get better.\\nA strict interpretation of \"disaster fatigue,\" Hardy said, puts disasters into three major categories: Natural disasters (such as COVID-19 and hurricanes), technological emergencies (chemical spills and power outages) and security emergencies (acts of terrorism and active shooters).\\xa0\\nBut Hardy said what qualifies as a disaster\\xa0can also be subjective.\\xa0\\n\"What may be a disaster to someone else, isn\\'t a disaster to you and me,\" he said.\\nWhile all of us are tapped into the disasters that become national news, community events can add to the mental load.

If he closes his eyes, he can picture the burning buildings.\\xa0\\nAs a child in Freetown, Sierra Leone, a nation in West Africa devastated by civil war,\\xa0Lewis-Nicol often imagined a better, safer life. His family fled the fighting, then returned to Sierra Leone\\xa0before moving to Ghana, about 900 miles away, when he was 15. Friends who traveled around the world spoke of an even safer place, with clean streets and unlimited opportunities: the USA.\\nLewis-Nicol knew he had to go.\\nThe 24-year-old is here, studying to receive his master\\'s degree in jazz performance from the University of Illinois. He’s been in the States four years – he earned his undergrad at Millikin University,\\xa0a small, private school in Decatur, Illinois –\\xa0set to graduate in 2022. He wonders whether\\xa0other West African natives will have the same chance.\\xa0\\nThis week, President Donald Trump\\'s administration unveiled proposed rule changes that would alter student visas, leaving the international student community reeling a few weeks into the 2020-21 academic year. The proposed changes – which are detailed in a 256-page document online and have drawn hundreds of public comments – could devastate science research and tech innovation\\xa0nationwide, experts warn.\\xa0\\n“The overall tone of the proposed rules sends a chilling message to current and prospective international students that we are no longer a welcoming nation,” said Stephen\\xa0Yale-Loehr, a professor and attorney at Cornell Law School who specializes in immigration law. “It says we’re more focused on national security threats\\xa0and that we suspect they could be coming here to do harm rather than help the U.S.”\\nPut another way: “It feels terrible,” Lewis-Nicol said. “The stigma is that if you’re from Africa, you’re not wanted and that your dreams are not as valid.”\\xa0\\nThe proposal comes on the heels of the Trump administration\\'s introduction – then abandonment – of a controversial rule barring international students from living in the USA while taking fall classes online during the pandemic. The administration scrapped the policy after a slew of lawsuits,\\nAccording to Yale-Loehr\\'s analysis, the latest\\xa0proposed changes would, among other things:\\xa0\\nStudents born in certain countries – particularly African nations, as well as Middle Eastern countries such as Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq – would be limited to two-year visas, which means no four-year degrees.\\xa0\\nTo stay in America, or go home? Coronavirus pandemic brings stress, fear for international students.\\nAt Millikin in Illinois, roughly 50% of the international student population comes from countries whose citizens would be restricted by the rules, such as Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Cameroon and Nepal, among others.\\xa0\\nThe college\\'s Center for International Education\\xa0is “sending things out almost constantly trying to calm the fears of our international students,\" Director Briana Quintenz said.\\n“It’s so unfair to them that they can’t just enjoy their college experience,” Quintenz said. “They have to continually dissect these very confusing regulations that seem to be coming out all the time. … My biggest concern is that the already very rigid\\xa0restrictions are going to become even more complicated, and international students are just going to stop trying to come to the U.S.”\\nYale-Loehr said the proposed changes don’t necessarily come as a surprise.\\xa0\\n“This is part of a larger anti-immigrant trend coming from this administration,” Yale-Loehr said.\\nIf the rule passes, it would be the biggest change to international student regulation in almost 20 years.\\nTrump administration\\xa0drops visa rule against online-only classes:But some new international students were still barred from USA\\nAfter 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security started a program requiring colleges to monitor international students to ensure they were here to study,\\xa0not for alternative purposes. Schools track whether international students don’t take a full course load or suddenly drop out.\\xa0\\nThe system is “cumbersome,” Yale-Loehr said, but it works:\\xa0Universities can see which students fall through the cracks. The proposed rule changes imply the system needs revamping, he said, “when colleges would tell you it’s working just fine.”\\xa0\\nThe Trump administration said the rule would strengthen the system to make sure only legitimate students friendly to the USA come to the country\\'s universities.\\n“Amending the relevant regulations is critical in improving program oversight mechanisms; preventing foreign adversaries from exploiting the country’s education environment; and properly enforcing and strengthening U.S. immigration laws,” said Ken Cuccinelli, a senior immigration official in the Department of Homeland Security.\\xa0\\nForeign students could\\xa0apply to extend their stay or\\xa0reapply for admission to the country, Cuccinelli said.\\nInternational students make up roughly 5%\\xa0of students at American universities and colleges, and their economic impact is staggering. According to NAFSA, the association of international educators, 1 million international students contributed $41 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2018-19 academic year.\\xa0\\nCOVID-19, visas, Trump: International students turn\\xa0away from US colleges for lots of reasons\\nMost international students pay full, out-of-state tuition costs, a boon to universities that allows them to keep costs lower for domestic students. The money international students spend on rent and at\\xa0restaurants is especially important in Midwest\\xa0college towns hit hard by recessions, said GauravKhanna,\\xa0an economist\\xa0at the University of California-San Diego. Then there are the academic concerns.\\xa0\\n“This wouldn’t just affect the university sector,” Khanna said. “While international students are here, they do critical research, but then after they graduate, a lot of them join the science and tech sector, where a lot of innovation happens.”\\xa0\\nInternational students said their contributions go beyond the economy.\\xa0\\nDev Purandare is a doctoral computer science student at the University of California-Santa Cruz, who came to the USA from India four years ago. Like most international students, he grew up believing the American higher education system was second to none.\\xa0\\n“For education, you can’t do much better,” Purandare said. “We can come here and get degrees, participate in research. But we also contribute. Over the course of my career, I’ve been a teaching assistant, I’ve taught courses, and right now I’m mentoring undergraduate and graduate students. And many of them are from California.”\\xa0\\nThe uncertain future has shaken Purandare and other students.\\xa0\\n“It’s demoralizing to international students to have to face a new crisis every month and wonder if we’ll be able to continue what we’re doing,” he said. “The lack of stability is really harmful for productivity. I can’t make any sort of life plans. I can’t even get a cat – because what if I have to leave the next day\\xa0or the next week?”\\nPurandare is in the middle of his doctoral\\xa0program, and his visa will be up for renewal in the next year. He’s worried about how that process could play out. Even if he’s OK, he said, he’s likely to accept a post-doc position outside the USA, where he feels more welcome.\\xa0\\nLewis-Nicol dreams of becoming such an accomplished musician, he can tour the world and win Grammys. Mostly, he wants to go back to Africa, build music schools and help his people. He thought the USA would be the best place to go to help fulfill his dreams, but he wonders whether he needs to look elsewhere. Maybe another country won’t define him solely\\xa0by his birthplace.\\xa0\\n“That’s why we’re leaving our countries, because we don’t want to be put in a box.\\xa0We want opportunities,” he said. “If America doesn’t want me, maybe I’ll go to Canada\\xa0or somewhere else.”\\xa0\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'The fate of thousands of potential voters blocked from registering when the state’s online system went down for several hours before Monday’s 11:59 p.m. deadline is now in the hands of a federal judge.\\nAfter a sometimes\\xa0heated\\xa0two-hour hearing Thursday, Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker said he would make a decision at some point later in the day whether the state had to extend the deadline.\\xa0\\n“I will try to get an order out quickly as I can today,” Walker said, noting that he had kept a jury\\xa0in another trial in Gainesville on hold for 90 minutes.\\nWalker also acknowledged the time constraints, with the election mere weeks away. He anticipated that whatever his order says, it will be appealed by one of the sides.\\nA coalition of voter registration groups, as well as the Dream Defenders, New Florida Majority, Florida Immigrant Coalition, Organize Florida and two would-be voters who said they\\xa0were prevented from registering before Monday\\'s deadline, sued the state. They claim\\xa0thousands of voters were disenfranchised when the online system crashed.\\nIn their lawsuit filed Tuesday against Gov. Ron DeSantis and Secretary of State Laurel Lee, the state\\'s chief elections officer, the plaintiffs also said a decision announced around noon Tuesday to extend the deadline to 7 p.m. Tuesday was not enough time to capture all the people who tried to register but couldn\\'t.\\nThey’ve\\xa0asked\\xa0for an additional extension of the voter registration deadline.\\nToward the beginning of the hearing, Walker dismissed DeSantis as a defendant, after a short discussion with his attorney to determine that DeSantis did not have the authority to extend the deadline in this context.\\xa0Lee said she had consulted with DeSantis before declaring Tuesday’s extension.\\n“Secretary Lee could have consulted tarot cards, but that doesn’t mean you can sue the tarot cards,” said Walker, an appointee of former President Barack Obama,\\xa0in the hearing.\\nAccording to numbers provided by Deputy Chief information Officer Scott Maynor, only 19% more people registered on the day of the deadline than had registered the day before – far short of the 140% uptick seen in 2018.\\xa0Extending the registration period to 7 p.m. added an additional 50,000 voters, Maynor said.\\n“It\\'s fair to say there was an impact because of system failure,”\\xa0said attorney Mohammed Jazil, representing Lee. “But we showed we addressed that.”\\nThat total still falls short of the expected increase, Walker said:\\xa0“I realize we abandoned science, but have we also shown that math is disfavored?” he asked. “Over 20,000\\xa0people lost out on their chance to register online because of this snafu.”\\nStuart Naifeh, representing the plaintiffs, said the number\\xa0of new voters don’t reflect all the people who tried and failed to register Monday. He also questioned whether the people who were blocked from registering online were notified of the extension.\\nWalker responded, “The fact that far fewer registered than could have would suggest that ‘Houston we have a problem,’ notwithstanding corrective action.”\\nThe state argued that extending the deadline further would place a burden on local supervisors of elections, submitting affidavits from Leon County Supervisor of Elections Mark Earley, who is currently vice president of the state supervisors association, and Okaloosa County Supervisor of Elections Paul Lux.\\nIn his experience, Earley said, another extension of the voter registration deadline would only add more confusion and reinforce the mistrust voters already have surrounding this election.\\nMore:Leon Elections Supervisor Mark Earley: Extending voter registration would create \\'confusion\\'\\n“Florida hasn’t managed to count votes properly when there wasn’t a pandemic,\" Walker said. \"The fact is, there is a pandemic. The fact is, huge percentages of people are voting by mail. The fact is, there will be huge lines. Don’t I have to consider the integrity of the entire voting process of Florida?”\\nSupervisors\\xa0have 13 days to process applications after they are submitted. Even though the deadline was 11:59 p.m., they are still required to take applications postmarked Oct. 5. They also continue to get applications after the deadline from the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles and public assistance agencies.\\xa0\\nWalker questioned Jazil several times about what authority the secretary had to extend the deadline beyond what state law says, and order county supervisors of elections to ignore the law. After several minutes going back and forth without getting a satisfactory answer, Walker said,\\xa0“Somebody has to have the legal authority to change it. You are joining in a circular firing squad to say we\\'re all meeting and talking about it.\\xa0\\n“The fact remains we have a mandate set by Florida law and somebody changed it. Did it happen organically or did it happen pursuant to her directive?\\nJazil also challenged the legal standing of the voter organizations to sue the state, especially after two voters named in the original complaint voluntarily dismissed themselves after it turned out they made false statements about their voter registration status.\\n“He hasn’t identified a single member of a single organization affected by the extension of the deadline,” Jazil said. “You need an actual member for standing, and none is listed… That is fatal.”\\nAlso, Jazil said, the organizations failed to provide specific details about projects that were placed on hold because of the system problems. “We have no specifics of what is being done differently,” he said. “I do not possibly understand how they have standing in light of this.”\\nNaifeh said their mission is to register voters, which was effectively stopped when the system went down.\\n“They were frustrated by the failure of the system and they continue to have that mission frustrated and injured,” he said.\\nFor example, one\\xa0organization had tried to help an ex-felon register after he finally paid off his fines on the day of the deadline. In other cases, people who only found out on Monday that their registration had lapsed couldn’t do anything about it until they got off work.\\nThe hearing also focused on the balancing test between the burdens a state imposes with voting\\xa0restrictions and the state\\'s asserted benefits. On the one hand,\\xa0there are disenfranchised voters who will be barred from voting in the Nov. 3 general election, Walker\\xa0said.\\nOn the other, there is a potential burden on the state and county elections officials if the deadline is extended as described by Earley’s “thoughtful affidavit describing potential confusion and problems….”\\nJazil said the registration system’s failure was a minor burden given that the state responded by extending the registration period. Walker disagreed.\\xa0\\n“If the system is down for six hours, and 50-60,000 people don\\'t get to register, I don\\'t understand for the life of me how that is minor,” the judge said. “You knew based on past years that thousands were going to use this device and it failed for hours.”\\nThat suggests the problem was more than an “oopsie,” Walker said.\\nOn the other hand, looking at the requested cure could add thousands of provisional ballots onto an already overwhelmed election system and a chaotic election,\\xa0Walker said.\\n“If reopened this for several hours, not hundreds but tens of thousands of people could apply. If I allow it to reopen for several hours, we’re still looking at a couple days from now,” he said. “Isn\\'t that a significant burden or harm when talking about balancing equity of public interest?”\\nNaifeh said his clients weren’t asking for the state to change its election rules, but to honor the ones they created:\\xa0“These were not people who missed the deadline. These are people that tried to submit their applications within the deadline.”\\nThis is a developing story.

       "  'body': 'Jason Nazmiyal, a prominent Persian carpet dealer based in New York, is used to America\\'s red tape when it comes to Iran.\\xa0\\nFor years, the Iranian American businessman has expertly navigated Washington’s sanctions and export rules to sell his pricey antique rugs – woven works of art – all over the world. But now, he says the Trump administration has so tainted any dealings with Iran that once simple business tasks have taken on a senseless and disorienting quality.\\xa0\\nNazmiyal, 60, was recently blocked from purchasing a carpet that was already in the U.S. and had\\xa0not been anywhere near Iranian soil for decades.\\xa0\\n\"This is the nonsense we have to deal with,\" he said. \"It\\'s becoming so difficult for us in the U.S. and also it\\'s hard to see how the sanctions harm Iran\\'s government, as opposed to its people,\" said Nazmiyal, who left Iran for the U.S. in 1978, a year before the Islamic revolution.\\nWhile some Iranian Americans fully\\xa0support President Donald Trump,\\xa0Nazmiyal is among scores of Iranian Americans who have no loyalty to the repressive regime in Tehran, but who are fed up with a White House that has vilified their homeland, banned their family members from visiting the U.S., and stoked fears of a military conflict. From the Muslim ban to an endless stream of sanctions and saber-rattling, they hear about their relatives suffering in Iran and feel increased hostility in their adopted homeland.\\nThe human cost of the Trump administration\\'s \"maximum pressure\" campaign against Iran is most visible in Iran itself. After Trump withdrew the U.S. from a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers a little over two years ago, he has gradually reimposed crushing sanctions\\xa0on vast swathes of Iran\\'s economy, its diplomats and its intelligence and security entities.\\nThe latest\\xa0sanctions were unveiled Thursday by the U.S. Treasury Department targeting Iran\\'s financial sector. They\\xa0could completely sever Iran’s economy from the outside world except in extremely limited circumstances. They\\xa0target 18\\xa0more\\xa0banks, effectively placing Iran\\'s\\xa0entire financial sector off-limits and forcing it to rely even more on informal or illicit trade.\\xa0\\nTrump admin\\xa0insists UN sanction restored on Iran:\\xa0No, they\\'re not, UN\\xa0says\\n\"Amid Covid19 pandemic, U.S. regime wants to blow up our remaining channels to pay for food & medicine,\" Iran\\'s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted, in reaction. \"Iranians WILL survive this latest of cruelties.\"\\nSanctions have hit Iran\\'s economy hard. GDP has contracted sharply. Oil exports have plummeted. The value of Iran\\'s rial currency has been cut in half and there has been runaway inflation alongside mass unemployment and skyrocketing living costs.\\xa0\\nThe official U.S. policy is that it doesn\\'t sanction humanitarian aid, but access to a range of critical health care drugs and products has become more difficult as imports have stalled. The sanctions have deterred many international banks from working with Iran over fears that they too could be caught up in so-called secondary U.S. sanctions.\\xa0\\nWho\\'s going to derail the U.S. election?:The culprit may be close to home\\n\"The Trump administration\\'s blanket maximum pressure policy has made it so no bank in the world is going to even want to touch Iran, regardless of the reason,\" said Ali Scotten, 40, a second generation Iranian American who was born\\xa0in Arizona and works as a consultant on Middle East issues.\\xa0\\nHe worries about his relatives in Iran. \"The daily cost of living has become astronomically higher,\" Scotten said, adding that Trump\\'s punishing sanctions have soured Iranians\\' views toward the U.S. \\xa0\\xa0\\nTrump and his advisers say their strategy is aimed at forcing Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions, curb its ballistic missile program, and end its support for militant proxy groups across the Middle East.\\xa0\\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Trump have repeatedly said these actions will eventually force Iran to seek a new agreement.\\xa0\\n\"Our maximum economic pressure campaign will continue until Iran is willing to conclude a comprehensive negotiation that addresses the regime’s malign behavior,\" Pompeo said in a statement touting Thursday\\'s sanctions. \"The United States continues to stand with the Iranian people, the longest-suffering victims of the regime’s predations.\"\\xa0\\nIran’s leaders have consistently rejected the president’s entreaties and pushed the U.S. to rejoin the existing agreement. Iran says it doesn\\'t care whether it\\'s Trump or his potential successor, Democratic Vice President Joe Biden, who does this.\\nCritics say Trump\\'s policy\\xa0has failed.\\nExperienced Iran-watchers such as Barbara Slavin, director of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, D.C., point out that Iran is now enriching uranium at a higher level than at any point since the Obama administration brokered the nuclear agreement in 2015.\\nIran may even soon have sufficient fissile missile material to produce a nuclear weapon. And it has become more, not less, aggressive in the Persian Gulf and Iraq. As U.S. and Iran tensions have spiked to dangerous levels, the U.S. policy has also deepened a divide between the U.S. and its closest allies in Europe, a point raised by\\xa0Democratic vice-presidential\\xa0nominee Kamala Harris during her Wednesday night debate with Vice President Mike Pence.\\n\\'I\\'m speaking\\':\\xa0Harris, Pence clash at vice presidential debate with body language\\nTrump\\'s approach to Iran has been an \"embarrassing mix of economic sanctions, botched diplomacy, and harsh rhetoric,\" Slavin wrote in a recent analysis.\\xa0\\nSome critics have suggested the Trump\\'s administration true goal in Iran is to topple the regime.\\xa0\\nThat would be just fine with\\xa0Afshine Ash\\xa0Emrani,\\xa0a 52-year-old cardiologist in California and full-throated Trump supporter.\\xa0\\nEmrani came to the U.S. with his parents when he was 17 years old –\\xa0fleeing the regime\\'s persecution of Iranian Jews. He voted for Trump in 2016 and counts himself as an even stronger supporter of the president now, even though he doesn\\'t like Trump\\'s sometimes \"crass\" rhetoric.\\xa0\\nIran’s Jewish community:The largest in Mideast outside Israel; many feel safe\\nHe views\\xa0Trump\\'s recent foreign policy victories\\xa0– persuading the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to normalize ties with Israel – as a major step toward further isolating Iran.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\"It\\'s going to take away a lot of the regime\\'s power...\\xa0because now the entire region will be against them,\" he said. \"My hope is that it will be a stepping stone towards changing the regime in Iran\" and making the government more friendly to both Israel and America.\\nBut for\\xa0Sahand Mirzahossein, a 39-year-old Chicagoan who works in the pharmaceutical industry, Trump\\'s election has brought nothing but anxiety and fear. When Trump ordered a drone strike that killed Iran\\'s most powerful military leader,\\xa0\"that was terrifying,\" he said. \"I was like, well,\\xa0this is war.\"\\nIran claims revenge for Qasem Soleimani killing:The US Navy is still a target\\nMirzahossein\\'s\\xa0parents left Iran after the revolution, and he has few family ties there now.\\n\"I feel torn about the direction America is taking because it is my home,\" he said. As a gay man, Mirzahossein\\xa0said he also feels targeted by Trump\\'s domestic policies, and he said it\\'s \"heartbreaking\" to see the \"open hostility\" toward the LGBTQ community and people of color.\\nAccording to the U.S. Department of State, there are an estimated 500,000 to one million people of Iranian descent living in the U.S., the highest number of Iranians outside Iran. The biggest Iranian-American communities are in California, followed by the New York and Washington D.C. metropolitan areas.\\nA majority do not support Trump’s policies, according to a 2019 survey from the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans (PAAIA), a non-partisan group that represents their interests. That survey found that two-thirds (66%) of Iranian-Americans feel that Trump has handled relations between the two adversaries \"poorly.\"\\nMore than 8 in 10 Iranian Americans said they have either directly been impacted by Trump\\'s 2017 travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries, including Iran, or have friends and family who have been impacted. Iran visas have been routinely denied since the ban.\\nBy contrast, when PAAIA\\'s survey was conducted the year before Trump took office, in 2016, more than two-thirds (71%) of respondents rated the Obama administration\\'s handling of U.S.-Iran relations as \"excellent\" or \"good.\"\\nThe survey revealed the expectation that the nuclear deal could serve as a path to improved U.S.-Iran relations – soured by decades of hostility that began when the CIA helped orchestrate the ouster of Iran\\'s democratically elected leader in 1953. By 1979, amid the birth of the Islamic Republic, 52 Americans were held hostage in the former U.S. Embassy for 444 days.\\nEconomic sanctions have been a regular part of the U.S.-Iran story ever since. \\xa0\\xa0\\nIran timeline:\\xa0A history of democracy, U.S. and British intervention, and cleric-control\\nBut it is not just about the inconvenience of having to apply for visa waivers that has concerned Iranian Americans under the Trump presidency.\\nPAAIA\\'s survey found that 71% of Iranian Americans are worried about increased discrimination and 63% have either personally experienced discrimination or\\xa0know someone else who has because of their ethnicity or country of origin. A majority (62%) fear possible U.S. military strikes against Iran, where they have many friends and relatives and retain deep cultural connections.\\nScotten, the Iranian American from Arizona,\\xa0said that just a few days after Trump\\'s election in 2016, his mother and a friend were hiking.\\n\"They were speaking Farsi and a lady started berating them for speaking a different language,\" he said. It was the first time in her 40 years in the U.S.\\xa0that she’s been harassed.\\xa0\\n\"It\\'s a direct result of Trump\\'s anti-immigrant rhetoric\" and efforts to make Americans afraid of immigrants, he said.\\xa0\\nFor Nazmiyal, the Trump administration\\'s Iran policy has brought a big\\xa0economic hit, since\\xa075% of his sales are in Persian rugs, and 40% of his business involves shipping these overseas. But\\xa0for Iranian American and San Francisco-resident Delfarib Fanaie the prohibitions have hurt those who can least afford it: poor and vulnerable children.\\nFanaie\\xa0runs Moms Against Poverty (MAP), an organization that sends humanitarian relief to Iran for underprivileged children. MAP has an official license from the U.S. Treasury Department that permits it to legally transfer funds to Iran from its bank in the U.S., via the banking system in Canada, and then onward to a bank in Tehran.\\nSince 2008, MAP has helped build more than 175 schools, orphanages, heath clinics and cultural centers in Iran.\\nYet Fanaie\\xa0said that while MAP itself has had little overt trouble from the U.S. Treasury Department, and in 2020 it actually saw the amount of humanitarian funds it is allowed to send under its export license to Iran increase because of the coronavirus pandemic, the problem is that the vast majority of international financial institutions are scared that if they do business with a U.S. entity sending money to Iran, they too will be sanctioned by Washington.\\nThe result of all this, Fanaie\\xa0said, is that her organization needs to be \"in constant touch\" with the U.S. Treasury Department to try to find obscure and mercurial banking channels to send MAP funds to Iran even though the U.S. government insists it has not created any barriers to these channels.\\xa0\\n\"Every day I am worried that a (bank) available to us the day before won\\'t be there in the morning,\" she said.\\n\"I mean, what is the point of having humanitarian permission to help underserved children in Iran and then effectively make it nearly impossible for most organizations to transfer these funds?\"\\nSome Iranian-Americans are conflicted about the Trump presidency.\\nDarius Massoudi, 32, a public policy advisor and lawyer for the state of Washington, said that in some respects Trump is \"the best U.S. president ever\"\\xa0because he has taken such a hard line against a brutal regime. Human Rights Watch and other groups say Iran\\xa0uses lethal force to crush political dissent and arbitrarily detains, tortures and kills protesters who demand freedom of expression and assembly. Iran denies this.\\xa0\\nAt the same time, Massoudi says Trump\\'s rhetoric has made him feel unwelcome.\\n\"There\\'s some of us who are like, well, we live in this country and Trump is treating us like garbage,\" said Massoudi, referring to the travel bans and his belief that Trump has disparaged minority groups. Massoudi said he briefly considered emigrating to Canada, which has a growing Iranian diaspora.\\nU.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Iran has sought to undermine Trump ahead of the U.S. presidential election.\\xa0\\n\"Democrats are softer compared to Republicans,\" Iran\\'s Sharq newspaper noted in a recent editorial, according the\\xa0Atlantic council.\\xa0\\n“I’m really nervous about this election,” said Mirzahossein. “Four more years of Trump means … honestly who knows.\"\\xa0\\nBut it\\'s not clear that for Iranian Americans, a\\xa0Biden presidency would be a\\xa0panacea, despite his pledge that if elected he would work to get back in the nuclear deal that Trump abandoned.\\xa0\\nBiden may want to re-enter the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (as the nuclear deal is known)\\xa0as quickly as possible, but he may not be able to automatically lift all of the Trump administration\\'s sanctions, as the Atlantic Council and others have pointed out.\\xa0And Iran may consider that a sticking point before it restarts complying with the nuclear accord, which it stayed in while the U.S. dropped out. Iran\\'s top diplomat Zarif also said recently that the country may\\xa0insist on some form of compensation from the U.S. for its treatment by the Trump administration.\\xa0\\n\"The question mark on Biden is going to be will he have the guts to re-enter the deal in a way that Iran feels necessary,\" said Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, founder of Bourse & Bazaar, a London based news and research group that focuses on Iran’s economy.\\n\"Some of the folks around Biden have suggested that\\xa0the U.S. might want to\\xa0take advantage of the leverage that\\'s been gained because of the Trump sanctions,\" he said.\\nBatmanghelidj said Iran\\'s difficulties in importing foods and life-saving medicines have been made worse\\xa0by COVID-19, but he did not believe Iran would be \"coerced into new negotiations\" and let the U.S. \"dictate the terms\" of its own re-entry to the nuclear deal and that even though Iran\\'s economy is in bad shape it will be able to \"limp along.\"\\nScotten, the consultant on Middle East issues from Arizona, said\\xa0supporting Biden is a \"no-brainer\" for him, because he has promised to return to the nuclear deal and lift the Muslim ban.\\xa0\\n\"Obviously there\\'s 40 years of mistrust and rivalry between the U.S. and Iranian governments, so there\\'s not going to be normalization of relations overnight,\" he said.\\xa0\\nInside Iran:America’s contentious history in Iran leads to mix of anger, wonderment and weariness\\n\"(But) there\\'s an absolute\\xa0night-and-day difference between the two candidates,\" he said. \"And just like on a personal level, the Muslim ban being rescinded (would mean) my family can come visit us again,\" he added, recounting that his mother\\'s sister was unable to attend his father\\'s funeral in 2018 because of the ban.\\xa0\\nFor\\xa0Nazmiyal, who has a collection of 4,000 antique and vintage rugs, the last few years have been about weathering frustrations, economic and political. He\\xa0believes that no matter who wins the election on Nov. 3 the Iranian people will still continue to suffer. He has also devised a new strategy of sorts for dealing with the sanctions on Iran. After months of trying to figure out a\\xa0workaround to purchase the carpet that had not set foot in Iran for more than 100 years: He gave up.\\xa0\\xa0\\n'},\n",

The number of uninsured grew by nearly 1.6 million people in 13 states identified as swing states by The Cook Political Report.\\nDuring his 2016 campaign, Trump promised to repeal and replace Obamacare and, once elected, he vowed everyone would have health insurance.\\nHealth care was a major issue in the 2018 midterm elections and could remain a salient one in the general election only seven weeks away. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to massive job losses in a country where 55% of health care coverage is tied to employment. One study estimated that 5.4 million American workers lost their health insurance between February and May.\\nTuesday's data release makes clear that U.S. residents already were hemorrhaging health insurance even before COVID. By far, the largest growth in the number of uninsured was in Texas, where the count swelled by 689,000 between 2016 and 2019.\\nIn Florida, the number of uninsured grew by 240,000 during Trump’s first three years. Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona saw the number of uninsured increase by more than 110,000.

       "  'body': \"Good morning, and welcome to the “This is America” newsletter centered on race, identity and how they shape our lives. I’m Jessica Flores, a breaking news fellow at USA TODAY.\\nBorn in Los Angeles, California, I am the daughter of two Salvadoran immigrants. Like many children of immigrants, I sometimes struggle with being ni de aquí, ni de allá – neither from here nor from there.\\xa0\\nIn honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, here's what I’ve learned about my own Latin American heritage.\\nEvery week, check here for important stories of the past week, from USA TODAY and other news sources.\\n––\\nLearning about my Salvadoran heritage has been a beautiful, yet painful discovery. As a child, I would travel every year to El Salvador to visit family and explore the country’s beautiful sites. But I did not know much about my parents’ migration story to the U.S.\\nThey only shared certain memories of their past. I think sharing, for them, means reliving a traumatic experience. That has left me putting together the pieces and learning about El Salvador’s history on my own.\\nMy father often shares with me how my grandmother and aunts are doing in El Salvador after speaking with them on the phone. In one of those conversations last year, I began to ask him about his childhood and what he remembers. I want to know more about your childhood there, I said.\\xa0\\nThe conversation always starts off pure. He begins telling me about playing with a caripucho, a cup-and-ball toy, as a child. The mangos verdes con alguashte, Salvadoran green mangos with pepita seasoning generously drizzled over them, he would eat. And how his father was a calm and loving man who never yelled at his kids.\\nMy father had only once mentioned about his father’s killing in the brutal Salvadoran civil war. A war that was backed by the U.S. government and claimed the lives of over 75,000. It never went beyond “The Salvadoran government killed my father.” Last year, I asked him directly.\\xa0\\nThe details are now clearer and haunting.\\nMy father was nine\\xa0years old when the war began in 1980. It was a war between the U.S.-backed Salvadoran military government and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) guerillas.\\nHis family were in their home when the Salvadoran military knocked on their door, he said. His mother quickly rushed the kids to hide under their beds. Military officials went looking for his father, whose family was helping the FMLN, my father confirmed.\\nAt this moment, my father’s eyes are filled with tears. He remembers the look in his father’s face as he’s escorted out of the house. Seconds later, he hears the gunshots.\\n“They killed my father,” he told me with tears rolling down his face.\\xa0\\nI cried with him, too. That moment I realized the trauma that he, and many other Salvadorans who fled the country because of the war, holds.\\nMy mother, on the other hand, left El Salvador at 16 years old because of poverty and the lack of opportunity of an education.\\nGrowing up she’d tell me and my sister that we’d have to work twice as hard and go to college if we want to be successful in the U.S.\\xa0\\nI am the first person in my family to graduate with my master's degree. Graduating from a school like the University of Southern California was one of my mother’s proudest moments.\\xa0\\nEvery now and then, my mother shares her memories of being in school. She stopped going to school by 8th grade to help her mother. All seven of her sisters had to drop out of school to work. But she loved learning and going to school more than anyone in the family, she says.\\n“Mi mamá me cortó mis alas,” she said. It was like her mother cut her wings.\\nBecause of this sacrifice, my mother has encouraged and supported my educational and professional career.\\xa0\\nIn honor of my family and heritage, it's important for me to\\xa0more about the intersection of my Salvadoran and American identity. Like the ways in which American policies have affected Salvadorans in the U.S. and in El Salvador.\\xa0\\nMy parent’s struggles and beautiful memories of El Salvador and in the U.S. show me how resilient they are. Latinx stories, and especially Central Americans, are often overlooked in films and the book publishing industry. This is why I cherish and respect my parent’s stories. They are part of what has shaped my identity. Through my journalism, I want to help people share their stories.\\nThe histories of Black, Latinx, Asian, Indigenous and other people of color are often not taught in detail in American schools.

       "  'body': 'The last time Amy Coney Barrett was nominated for a federal court judgeship, her deep religious convictions came under attack from Democrats who voted almost in lockstep against her.\\xa0\\nNow that President Donald Trump\\xa0has nominated her again\\xa0– this time for a seat on the Supreme Court that she may hold for decades to come\\xa0– Democrats once again are sure to vote against her. But not because of her religion.\\nBarrett, 48, proved to be a Teflon nominee in 2017 for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. Not only did she deflect Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein\\'s concern that \"the dogma lives loudly within you,\" but her Catholic and conservative backers used the phrase on T-shirts, tote bags and coffee mugs in a sign of support.\\nThis time, her nomination to the seat held for 27 years by Associate Justice\\xa0Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\xa0– a women\\'s rights icon and the subject of far more paraphernalia – makes Barrett\\'s nomination a potential turning point for the nation\\'s judicial system.\\nThe nominee acknowledged the moment in her remarks to a supportive crowd gathered in the White House Rose Garden. She paid homage to Ginsburg as \"a woman of enormous talent and consequence\" who \"not only broke glass ceilings, she smashed them.\"\\nIf confirmed as Ginsburg\\'s successor, she said, \"I would not assume that role for the sake of those in my own circle, and certainly not for my own sake.\\xa0I would assume this role to serve you.\"\\nNow\\xa0rather than focusing on religion, opponents are warning of possible\\xa0Supreme Court\\xa0reversals on abortion, guns, health care and more.\\nMore:Trump embraces political battle with pick of Amy Coney Barrett\\xa0for Supreme Court\\n\"Even in her short time on the bench, (Barrett)\\xa0has very concerning rulings\\xa0that relate to important issues, like protections for LGBTQ Americans, immigrants, the Affordable Care Act,\\xa0and abortion rights,\"\\xa0Elizabeth Wydra, president of the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center, said earlier this week.\\xa0\"So\\xa0we should be concerned about this\\xa0particular nominee.\"\\nBut Barrett\\'s allies and colleagues herald her as an almost perfect choice based on her judicial opinions, academic writings and personal life as the mother of seven children, all of whom accompanied her to the White House Saturday.\\n\"She is a respected scholar, an award-winning teacher, a razor-sharp lawyer, a disciplined and diligent jurist, and a person of the highest character,\" Rick Garnett, founding director of Notre Dame Law School’s\\xa0Program on Church, State, and Society, said in 2018 when Barrett\\xa0competed for the nomination that went to Brett Kavanaugh.\\nMore:Health care law faces another Supreme Court showdown, this time without Ginsburg\\'s vote\\nBarrett has been winning kudos like that for decades. Every living law clerk who worked at the Supreme Court during its 1998 term signed a letter in 2017 endorsing her appeals court nomination, including those who worked for liberal justices.\\xa0\\n\"Professor Barrett is a woman of remarkable intellect and character,\" the 34 former law clerks wrote. \"Based on our observations, we came to respect Professor Barrett’s conscientious work ethic, her respect for the law, and her remarkable legal abilities.\"\\nThat popularity has been evident as well at Notre Dame Law School, where Barrett, an alumni,\\xa0has been named\\xa0professor of the year three times since 2002.\\n\"She\\'s mind-blowingly intelligent, and she\\'s also one of the most humble people you\\'re going to meet,\" said professor Stephen Yelderman, a recent law clerk for Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch. \"Judge Barrett is the complete package.\"\\nAnd it is palpable in her South Bend, Ind., community, where she juggles judging, teaching and, with her husband Jesse, raising seven children, including two adopted from Haiti and one with special needs.\\n“On a personal level, you’re amazing\\xa0–\\xa0to have seven\\xa0children and do what you do,\" Feinstein marveled during Barrett\\'s confirmation hearing in 2017.\\nThat wasn\\'t all she said.\\nIn a dialogue that cemented Barrett\\'s reputation among conservatives and defenders of religious freedom, Feinstein and other Democrats questioned whether the depth of Barrett\\'s\\xa0Catholic convictions might affect her rulings from the bench on issues such as abortion.\\n\"If you\\'re asking whether I take my faith seriously and I\\'m a faithful Catholic, I am,\" Barrett responded,\\xa0\"although I would stress that my personal church affiliation or my religious belief would not bear in the discharge of my duties as a judge.\"\\nMore than a decade earlier in 2006, Barrett described her vision for being a \"different kind of lawyer.\"\\nAddressing Notre Dame Law School\\'s 2006 graduating class, she reminded the students that their legal careers are but a means to an end: namely, building the \"kingdom of God.\"\\n\"If you can keep in mind that your fundamental purpose in life is not to be a lawyer, but to know, love and serve God, you truly will be a different kind of lawyer,\" she said.\\nBarrett’s past membership in the religious group People of Praise has been scrutinized by national media outlets. The group dates to the early 1970s and grew out of the “charismatic” movement, sharing some traits of Protestant Pentecostal groups. It has about 1,700 adult members today.\\nSome critics have suggested that its system of spiritual mentorship could raise questions of intellectual independence for Barrett on prospective cases. But Garnett said her participation in the group is “not so different from the lived religious experiences of millions of Americans.”\\nFact check:\\'Kingdom of God\\' comment by Amy Coney Barrett lacks context in viral meme\\nIf her religious views are less controversial this time around, her opinions and writings on abortion and other hot-button issues will take center stage.\\nBarrett\\xa0has written that Supreme Court precedents are not sacrosanct, which liberals have interpreted as a threat to the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide.\\xa0\\nMore:Supreme Court\\'s split decision for abortion rights gives opponents an unlikely boost\\nIn a 2013\\xa0Texas Law Review article\\xa0exploring when the Supreme Court should overturn past decisions, Barrett wrote that she agrees \"with those who say that a\\xa0justice’s duty is to the Constitution, and that it is thus more legitimate for her to enforce her best understanding of the Constitution rather than a precedent she thinks clearly in conflict with it.”\\nShe also wrote that the public’s response to controversial cases like Roe v. Wade “reflects public rejection” of the idea that legal precedent “can declare a permanent victor in a divisive constitutional struggle.”\\nMore:Casting aside its precedents, Supreme Court moves inexorably toward those on abortion rights\\nA former member of the University of Notre Dame’s “Faculty for Life,” Barrett signed a\\xa02015 letter\\xa0to Catholic bishops that affirmed the “teachings of the Church as truth.” Among those teachings: the “value of human life from conception to natural death” and marriage-family values\\xa0“founded on the indissoluble commitment of a man and a woman.”\\nThose views give anti-abortion groups hope that with her vote, the Supreme Court will uphold efforts by states to further restrict abortion rights\\xa0– and potentially overrule Roe v. Wade some day.\\n\"This is a turning point for the nation in the fight to protect its most vulnerable, the unborn,\" Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which opposes abortion, said upon\\xa0Ginsburg\\'s death last week.\\nIn a 2013 speech at Notre Dame on the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, Barrett said the ruling \"essentially permitted abortion on demand.\" But she declared it \"very unlikely\" the Supreme Court ever would overturn its core protection of abortion rights, according to coverage of her remarks in university publications.\\n\"The fundamental element, that the woman has a right to choose abortion, will probably stand,\" the student newspaper The Observer quoted her saying. \"The controversy right now is about funding. It\\'s a question of whether abortions will be publicly or privately funded.\"\\nBeyond abortion, liberals are most concerned about Barrett\\'s impact on health care, and specifically the Affordable Care Act. The law is coming before the court again in November, with Texas leading a group of states seeking to strike it down. If confirmed by the Senate before Election Day, she\\xa0could be on the bench to hear that case a week later.\\nBarrett\\xa0wrote in 2017\\xa0that Chief Justice John Roberts pushed the law\\xa0beyond its plausible meaning in order to save it. Roberts creatively interpreted as a tax the law’s penalty on those who don’t buy insurance, allowing the court to uphold the constitutionality of the law, she said.\\nMore:Supreme Court once again will decide fate of Affordable Care Act\\nShe also criticized the Obama administration’s method under the health care law for giving employees of religious-affiliated organizations access to birth control without having the institutions pay for it. Religiously-affiliated charities and universities were allowed to shift the cost on to their health insurance providers, but they\\xa0argued that still left them involved.\\nA letter\\xa0Barrett and more than 300 academics signed\\xa0said the accommodation “changes nothing of moral substance and fails to remove the assault on religious liberty.” The Supreme Court in July\\xa0ultimately ruled those employers do not have to be involved in providing contraceptive coverage.\\nMore:Supreme Court allows religious, moral exemptions for employers opposed to contraceptives\\nDuring her three years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, which includes Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin, Barrett\\xa0has ruled in cases involving abortion, sexual assault, guns, race and immigration. Among them:\\nAbortion: Barrett signed a dissent indicating she would have reheard Indiana\\'s defense of a law banning abortions based on sex, race or disability. Indiana did not seek the appeals court\\'s review, but the dissent nevertheless referred to \"eugenics\" and said \"none of the (Supreme) Court’s abortion decisions holds that states are powerless to prevent abortions designed to choose the sex, race, and other attributes of children.\" The high court later refused to consider the state\\'s appeal.\\nSexual assault: Barrett and two other judges reversed a lower court ruling and allowed a\\xa0male student to sue Purdue University for suspending him after finding him guilty of sexual assault. The student\\'s \"allegations raise a plausible inference that he was denied an educational benefit on the basis of his sex,\" she wrote.\\nGuns:\\xa0Barrett dissented when the court upheld a decision restricting the Second Amendment rights of a felon convicted of mail fraud. She said non-violent offenders should not lose their constitutional right to firearms possession.\\nImmigration: In dissent, Barrett defended the\\xa0Trump administration\\'s rule denying immigrants permanent residence if they become regular users of public assistance.\\xa0\\nRace: Barrett helped to block the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\\'s effort to stop an employer from transferring Chicago-area employees based on their race or ethnicity. The agency had accused AutoZone of making the transfers to reflect area demographics. Three dissenting judges said the policy \"deprived people ... of employment opportunities at their preferred geographic location.\"\\nAge discrimination: Barrett\\xa0ruled that the\\xa0Age Discrimination in Employment Act does not apply when policies\\xa0impact plaintiffs unintentionally. The ruling went\\xa0against a 58-year-old job applicant who lost out to someone half his age when\\xa0the company sought to hire a person with less than seven years\\' experience.\\nMore:Supreme Court is shorthanded but could play role in election\\nBarrett\\'s opinions have won broad praise from conservative lawyers and academics. She is an adherent of originalism and textualism, judicial philosophies that\\xa0teach judges\\xa0should interpret the Constitution and legislation as written.\\xa0\\n“President Trump has again fulfilled his promise to appoint justices who are not only exceptionally qualified\\xa0but willing to bravely stand up for the Constitution as it’s written and not bend to political pressures or personal preferences,\" said Leonard Leo, an adviser to the White House on judicial nominations who also serves as co-chairman\\xa0of the conservative Federalist Society. \"Judge Barrett will be a great role model for future generations seeking to ensure that the rule of law advances the dignity of all people.”\\n“In terms of intellectual caliber, she is as impressive as they come,\" said Jonathan Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, where Barrett spoke in 2019. \"The combination\\xa0of intellect, poise, thoughtfulness and\\xa0principle is really remarkable.”\\nBarrett was born in New Orleans, from which she and her husband retain a penchant for Cajun cooking and Mardi Gras parties. The oldest of seven children, she graduated from Rhodes College in Tennessee before enrolling at Notre Dame Law School, from which she graduated first in her class in 1997.\\n“My recollection is that she was quietly brilliant, reasonable, kind and a good person,\" recalled Tom Arkell, who graduated the same year. \"If there was one person in my\\xa0class\\xa0I would have expected to become a United States Supreme Court justice, it is Amy Coney Barrett.\"\\nShe clerked for two renowned conservative jurists - Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, then-Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia. It was during the latter clerkship that she earned the respect of her three dozen colleagues.\\n“I remember being struck about how she commanded the room, and everyone respected her,” said Nicole Garnett, who clerked for Associate Justice Clarence Thomas the same term. “Even then, she stood out. And this was not a slouchy bunch.”\\xa0\\nHer liberal colleagues felt the same way. \"Measured subjectively and unscientifically by pure legal acumen, she was one of the two strongest lawyers,\" Harvard law professor Noah Feldman, who testified in favor of Trump\\'s impeachment last year, wrote Saturday in a Bloomberg column.\\nAfter working briefly in private practice, Barrett\\xa0returned to Notre Dame to teach in 2002 and has been doing so ever since. For a class on evidence, Barrett referred students to the plot of \"My Cousin Vinny,\" a 1999 film in which two young friends from New York find themselves charged with murder and robbery in Alabama.\\nRev. John Jenkins, Notre Dame\\'s president, praised Barrett in a statement last week. \"The same\\xa0impressive intellect, character and temperament that made Professor Barrett a successful nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals would serve her equally well as a nominee for the nation\\'s highest court,\" he said.\\nBarrett\\'s husband is a former federal prosecutor now working in private practice. They are the parents of four girls and three boys\\xa0who smiled through Saturday\\'s Rose Garden ceremony. Trump noted that if confirmed, Barrett would be the first mother of school-age children to serve on the high court.\\n\"I\\'m better known back home as a room parent, carpool driver and birthday party planner,\" Barrett said.\\nAs for their youngest child, Benjamin, who has Down syndrome, Barrett has spoken of facing \"unique challenges.\"\\n\"But I think all you need to know about Benjamin\\'s place in the family is summed up by the fact that the other children unreservedly identify him as their favorite sibling,\" she said in 2017\\xa0– and repeated almost verbatim Saturday.\\nIn a 2018 law school graduation speech at Notre Dame after being chosen by students as distinguished professor of the year for the third time, Barrett emphasized that the law is intended\\xa0to serve everyday Americans.\\n“Diseases are named after the doctors who identify them. … But cases are different,\" she said. \"Cases are not named after the lawyers who litigated them, or the judges who decided them, but after the people on whom they had the greatest effect.”\\nContributing: Kevin McCoy, Nick Penzenstadler and Michael Collins,\\xa0USA TODAY; Caleb Bauer,\\xa0Margaret Fosmoe and Christian Sheckler,\\xa0South Bend Tribune\\n'},\n",

The \"Unite the Right\" event drew\\xa0members of the alt-right who did Nazi salutes.\\n\"There’s been a fairly long history, since he got back into the election, of him basically using hate speech to promote his ideas,\" said\\xa0Michael Waltman, associate professor in the department of communication at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. \"His immigration policy is grounded largely in xenophobia. He has said really horrific things about Mexicans. He’s done some pretty horrific things to Mexicans.\"\\nAt a recent rally in\\xa0Bemidji, Minnesota, the president\\xa0injected eugenics into his speech,\\xa0praising the mostly white crowd for their \"good genes\" while attacking Somali refugees.\\xa0\\nHe said the state of Minnesota\\xa0was built by strong men and women who braved the wilderness and cold winters to create a better life.\\xa0\\n“You have good genes, you know that, right?” Trump said. “You have good genes. A lot of it is about the genes, isn’t it, don’t you believe? The racehorse theory. You think we’re so different? You have good genes in Minnesota.”\\nMinnesota is 80% white but\\xa0has the highest number of refugees per capita of any state.\\nMore:Trump to resume campaigning with in-person events at White House and in Florida\\nMore:Trump says he moved to end racial sensitivity training in federal agencies ‘because it’s racist’\\nMore:Pence denies systemic racism, Harris decries Trump administration \\'pattern\\' of racism in historic debate\\nThe idea of better genes is at the root of the eugenics movement, which started in the late 1800s and grew in the U.S. in the early 20th century, backed by scholars, scientists and the government. Eugenics, a term coined by Charles Darwin’s cousin\\xa0Francis Galton in 1883, is the philosophy and social movement that encourages reproduction by people or populations believed to have the most desirable traits and discourages reproduction by the “unfit” – those people believed to have undesirable qualities.\\xa0\\nIn the U.S., eugenics programs boiled down to limiting the number of offspring from immigrants, Blacks, Indigenous people, poor whites and people with disabilities.\\xa0\\nLewis Gordon, who heads the philosophy department at the University of Connecticut, said Trump was perpetuating a notion of superiority among white people.\\xa0\\n“Most people who hear Trump’s ramblings don\\'t have the history to know that his words are those of racists,\" Gordon said. \"Today, Trump can say ‘gene’ –\\xa0that some have ‘good genes’ – and it is implying superiority. Since all racism stems from narcissism, Trump is appealing to the narcissists in the crowd who believe anything they do is superior. They believe they are born with better genes.”\\nThe White House maintains that Trump is not racist.\\xa0\\n“Donald Trump’s record as a private citizen and as president has been one of fighting for inclusion and advocating for the equal treatment of all,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews told The\\xa0Washington Post last month. “Anyone who suggests otherwise is only seeking to sow division.”\\nAt a campaign rally in Duluth, Minnesota, on Sept. 30, Trump blasted Biden\\'s plan to allow more refugees from war-torn countries into the United States, warning his supporters that it would lead to overcrowded schools and hospitals.\\xa0\\nHe claimed a Biden presidency would mean a \"700% increase in refugees coming from the most dangerous places in the world including Yemen, Syria, and your favorite country Somalia.\"\\n\"This guy loves Somalia,\" Trump said. \"Biden will turn Minnesota into a refugee camp.\"\\nBut Trump\\'s controversial\\xa0comments about nonwhite immigrants\\xa0and\\xa0certain foreign countries is not new.\\xa0\\nHe has consistently\\xa0denigrated\\xa0Mexicans\\xa0and built his campaign for president on a promise to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.\\xa0On Sept. 1, the\\xa0U.S. Customs and Border Protection\\xa0reported that 307 miles of the border wall have been built.\\xa0\\nTrump has described\\xa0Mexican immigrants as\\xa0\"rapists\" who bring drugs and crime to the U.S.\\nHe also kept a campaign promise to ban Muslims from the country. In January 2017\\xa0– his first month in office\\xa0– he\\xa0restricted travel from seven\\xa0Muslim-majority countries. After a series of court challenges, the restrictions were\\xa0upheld by the Supreme Court.

       "  'body': 'Montgomery: The city is struggling with maintenance at the historic Oakwood Cemetery amid the coronavirus pandemic. Montgomery has owned and maintained the cemetery since it started in 1819, cutting and clearing 120 acres of historic graves and mausoleums. It’s the final resting place for country legend Hank Williams as well as a wide swath of early Montgomery – governors, slaves, immigrants, anti-secessionists and Confederate generals. State inmates on work release usually do most of the maintenance. But work release details have been canceled since March because of the pandemic. That left the city with six employees dedicated to the cemetery. Since then, two have quit, one had heart surgery, and one had a stroke. That’s in addition to the pandemic’s effect on city staff. Tom Pierce, head of general services, returned to the job Monday after two weeks in quarantine. “Unfortunately, grass doesn’t care about COVID. It continues to grow,” Pierce said.\\nAnchorage: The municipal government has projected a $17 million revenue shortfall for 2020 because of the economic impact of the coronavirus. The loss represents 3% of the general government operating budget for Anchorage, The Anchorage Daily News reports. Lost tax revenue accounts for $14.4 million of the shortfall, the city said. Anchorage Chief Financial Officer Alex Slivka said the city plans to reroute federal coronavirus recovery funds to fill most of the gap. An ordinance proposed by Mayor Ethan Berkowitz’s administration would repeal part of the federal recovery funding package approved by the Anchorage Assembly, Slivka said. The ordinance would reroute about $61 million of those funds to the payroll for first responders, freeing up general fund dollars that otherwise would have been used for payroll costs.\\nPhoenix: Elections officials should suspend plans to help voters in nursing homes and hospitals cast ballots through video calls, Gov. Doug Ducey said in a letter to Secretary of State Katie Hobbs. Arizona provides what are known as special election boards to people in hospitals and long-term care facilities, allowing them to cast a vote in person without being in a traditional polling place. But with long-term care facilities hit hard by COVID-19, visitor restrictions can make the job more difficult for special election boards, so in some places they are adjusting with technology. Counties including Maricopa and Pima plan to let residents cast their vote in person or on a video call. A voter could tell the board how to mark their ballot, for example, if the voter cannot mark it himself or herself. But Ducey raised objections about this plan, pointing to a section of state law that says a special election board’s services must be “delivered to the elector in person.”\\nLittle Rock: A lawsuit filed Tuesday asks a federal judge to require state election officials to give absentee voters a chance to correct their ballots before they’re rejected due to signature issues. The League of Women Voters of Arkansas argues in the lawsuit that state law regarding absentee ballots disenfranchises voters because they’re not given any notice or chance to cure any deficiencies. State law requires election officials to reject absentee ballots that are missing a voter’s signature or if there’s a mismatch between the signature, address or date of birth on the absentee ballot and the application materials. According to the lawsuit, Arkansas already provides notification to absentee voters if there are photo ID issues with their ballots. A spike in absentee ballots is expected in the state because of the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Asa Hutchinson last month signed an executive order stating that concerns about the virus were a valid excuse to vote absentee.\\nLos Angeles: More of the state was cleared to reopen additional businesses Tuesday, including most of the San Francisco Bay Area and one of Southern California’s largest counties, as coronavirus infection rates have fallen to their lowest level of the pandemic. Dr. Mark Ghaly, the state health secretary, also said nail salons could resume operations with restrictions statewide, though he cautioned that California’s reopening must remain “slow and stringent” and that residents cannot let their guard down as flu season arrives and cases rise in Europe and other parts of the U.S. The lifting of some restrictions in counties that have shown improvement comes as California tries for a second time to recover from the devastating impact COVID-19 has had on business. An earlier effort to reopen more quickly backfired with a surge in cases and hospitalizations in late spring and early summer.\\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis announced mandatory furloughs of state workers due to pandemic-related budget cuts and warned Tuesday about a third wave of coronavirus outbreaks if the state’s upward trend continues. The number of days will be based on an employee’s annual salary with exemptions for those necessary for the COVID-19 response, assisting Coloradans in finding jobs, and protecting public safety and roads, as well as workers earning $50,000 a year or less. “The public sector, too, needs to tighten its belts to get through this,” Polis said at a news conference. Workers earning $50,000 to $70,000 will be furloughed for one day, $70,000 to $90,000 for two days, $90,000 to $140,000 for three days, and above $140,000 for four days. Polis also said that Colorado had 654 new cases of the coronavirus Tuesday. The largest number of cases in the state is among 18- to 25-year-olds, most from the University of Colorado Boulder.\\nPreston: The state is providing a $7 million loan to the Mystic Aquarium, a nonprofit that’s been hit hard financially after being forced to close for almost four months because of the pandemic. Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said the multipronged arrangement with the aquarium is part an ongoing effort to try to help the state’s important tourism industry, including nonprofit and commercial businesses. “We’re coming up with some state programs that get them through until we’re in an economy that’s a lot stronger for everybody,” Lamont said following a tour of Holmberg Orchards in nearby Gales Ferry. State lawmakers from eastern Connecticut, who had urged Lamont back in May to help the aquarium, have suggested that a pool of $20 million in state money is needed to help tourism as well as arts and culture attractions.\\nDover: Delaware’s Emergency Management Agency is planning to add eight to 10 pop-up testing sites each week that will respond to COVID-19 outbreaks. The Delaware State News reports those sites will change weekly based on data from the Delaware Division of Public Health. “Our job is to try to make sure they’re convenient, effective, and they are where and when people need them,” DEMA Director A.J. Schall said Tuesday at a weekly COVID-19 press briefing. The state is still rolling out its new at-home test. The tests are mailed to a person and then performed over Zoom with a medical professional for instruction. They are then mailed to a lab with results expected in 48-72 hours. The at-home tests are recommended for people who are 60 years old or older and who might have trouble finding transportation to a testing site.\\nWashington: Women’s Food Fest, running from Wednesday through Sept. 30, aims to help promote women-owned small businesses in D.C. that have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, WUSA-TV reports. Women’s Food Fest grew from a James Beard Foundation program called “Let’s Talk DC” – a local forum bringing female food entrepreneurs together to support one another, take collective action, and help one another survive the present economic and health crisis, according to the organizer of the fest. “We are highlighting women entrepreneurs who took the leap to open their own businesses and have become the heart of their communities. They now need your support by your patronage as they navigate the new ‘normal’ and try to keep their businesses open during this pandemic,” food fest organizers said in a statement. Organizers will also distribute 700 meals to local communities in need.\\nWest Palm Beach: The school district is scrambling to find substitute teachers after a large number of full-time teachers chose to stay home as students returned to brick-and-mortar classes for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began. The Palm Beach County school district said 944 teachers did not show for work Monday when students who chose the in-school option returned to classrooms. The number was slightly lower – nearly 894 teachers, or roughly 1 of every 13 – on Tuesday. Officials said 387 substitute teachers were called in to assist Tuesday across the district, which consist of 180 campuses. Some 58,000 students were in classrooms Tuesday, officials said. Many principals asked teachers to supervise two classes at one time or sent other employees to monitor classrooms. In other cases, students were sent to overflow rooms until their next class.\\nAthens: COVID-19 infections at the University of Georgia declined for the second week in a row, the university reported Wednesday. UGA’s DawgCheck system listed a total of 163 positives, including 153 students, 10 staff member and no faculty members. Last week, UGA reported 446 positive tests, including 404 students, 16 staff and one faculty member. Meanwhile, UGA is listing higher numbers from earlier weeks than what was originally reported. For the week ending Sept. 13, UGA originally reported 421 new cases and now lists the figure as 446; the week prior to that, UGA originally listed 1,412 positives but now lists 1,500. “Numbers may be adjusted for multiple reasons,” UGA spokesman Greg Trevor said in an email. “For example, these results may be reconciled with final data from the Georgia Department of Public Health. Adjustments also may reflect off-campus tests.”\\nHonolulu: Mayor Kirk Caldwell said Tuesday that the city plans to allow some activities that were shut down last month to control the spread of the coronavirus to resume under new guidelines. Beginning Thursday, the city will allow social gatherings of up to five people, including at beaches and hiking trails. Retail businesses will be allowed to open at 50% of capacity. Caldwell said Gov. David Ige verbally approved the new guidelines but had not signed them yet. Restaurants would be allowed to seat up to five diners at a table as long as the patrons provide their names and contact information so tracers can reach them later if necessary. Diners will have to wear masks when they are not eating. Honolulu again adopted strict restrictions a month ago after cases began to spike after hovering at low levels when the pandemic began. Honolulu’s new daily case count has since declined.\\nPocatello: The chief medical officers of two hospitals recently warned state public health officials that their facilities are close to being overwhelmed by patients infected with the coronavirus. Dr. Daniel Snell of the Portneuf Medical Center and Dr. Ken Newhouse of Bingham Memorial Hospital told the Southeastern Idaho Public Health Board of Directors that the current rate of hospitalizations from COVID-19 is unsustainable. “We are on a razor’s edge where with exponential growth and with continued people doing things in the community, we could have a sudden uptick that could happen very, very quickly,” Newhouse said. “We could go into overload mode pretty quickly here.” Snell said his hospital could make accommodations for up to 50 patients, but that would put the facility in a “code black situation where we shut everything else down.”\\nSpringfield: The state Department of Public Health on Tuesday reported 1,531 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 30 more confirmed deaths, with Illinois’ seven-day positivity rate at 3.5%. The latest COVID-19 numbers come as the city of Chicago placed Wisconsin on its 14-day quarantine list. Placement on the list is triggered by averaging more than 15 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents over a seven-day period. Also joining the list are Montana, Idaho, Minnesota and Puerto Rico. Authorities say the surge of coronavirus cases in Wisconsin is being driven by students at the various campuses of the University of Wisconsin. Despite the threat by Chicago officials to levy fines, the travel advisory is more educational than real. Compliance is voluntary. So far, warning letters are as far as City Hall has gone to enforce the advisory.\\nIndianapolis: A statewide mask order will continue for another three weeks under a new order the governor announced Wednesday even as he has faced public discontent over coronavirus restrictions amid his reelection campaign. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb said he would be dropping most other limits on businesses and crowd sizes as of Saturday. The mask order will be extended until Oct. 17. Holcomb said those restrictions could be removed because the state has seen progress in recent weeks in slowing the coronavirus spread. His action lifts statewide capacity limits for restaurants and bars and crowd limits for social events. The mask order was first issued two months ago and has drawn ire among conservatives who believe his executive orders in response to the pandemic have gone too far. That has complicated his reelection campaign against Democrat Woody Myers, with some saying they’ll support Libertarian candidate Donald Rainwater.\\nDes Moines: Health officials are working to determine what is causing a spike in coronavirus cases in the northwest corner of the state where several counties are seeing a surge, Gov. Kim Reynolds said Tuesday. Sioux County has a 14-day positivity rate of 30%. Public health officials usually recommend mitigation measures including crowd restrictions, face coverings and business closures to slow the virus’ spread when an area surpasses 5% positivity. Two adjacent counties, Lyon and Osceola, have rates above 20%. The Republican governor acknowledged the rate of spread is very high but said she’s hopeful it is stabilizing. “I don’t know what’s going on up there,” Reynolds said. “It’s what we see a lot of times when we start to open things up, and I think we should expect that you’re going to see probably a little uptick in cases.”\\nTopeka: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s office blocked a legislative committee from obtaining a list of the state’s personal protective equipment suppliers, a Republican lawmaker told colleagues Tuesday. Sen. Dennis Pyle of Hiawatha released emails during a meeting of a House-Senate study committee showing that the panel’s request had been refused. The committee is considering whether the laws need to be revised in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The committee sought the list after state Adjutant General David Weishaar, who oversees the Division of Emergency Management, testified last month that some of the state’s personal protective equipment was defective. According to the emails, the department cited instructions from the governor’s staff in declining to release the list. Will Lawrence, Kelly’s chief of staff, said it was merely an effort to narrow the request to avoid wasting the time of agency staffers responding to the pandemic.\\nFrankfort: The state won swift federal approval for another infusion of extra unemployment payments for many people who lost work during the COVID-19 outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday, one day after he announced his administration requested the supplemental $400 in weekly benefits for another three weeks. “It’s a win for those that have been struggling to get those extra dollars in,” the governor told reporters. “It’s also a win for our state because it continues consumer confidence. We see the money cycle through our economy, especially retailers and others that have been struggling.” Beshear also reported 824 more COVID-19 cases statewide and seven more virus-related deaths. Kentucky’s positivity rate – a rolling figure reflecting the average proportion of tests coming back positive for COVID-19 – rose to 4.52%, ending a recent trend in which it has been below 4%.\\nNatchitoches: A 136-year-old university has set an enrollment record in spite of the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused problems in higher education nationwide. The record “is remarkable and especially gratifying in the midst of the global pandemic,” Northwestern State University President Chris Maggio said. According to the newspaper, the school this fall has an enrollment of 11,447. That’s an increase of 5% or 547 students over last year’s enrollment of 10,900. In addition to the main campus in Natchitoches, Northwestern State has campuses in Shreveport and Alexandria and other sites that include online classes.\\nMadison: An employee at a nursing home where a coronavirus outbreak has killed seven residents worked an overnight shift while she had COVID-19 symptoms, a newspaper reports. The certified nursing assistant at Maplecrest Rehabilitation & Living Center in Madison documented her symptoms – a sore throat, cough, chills and muscle aches – in a written log but apparently didn’t tell her supervisors, and supervisors apparently didn’t review the log, the Bangor Daily News reports. She tested positive for the coronavirus a few days later. A coronavirus outbreak to which the employee is believed to have contributed has since infected at least 39 residents and employees, and seven residents have died. It’s one of several secondary outbreaks linked to an Aug. 7 wedding in the Katahdin region that’s responsible for about 180 cases of COVID-19 across the state.\\nBaltimore: State officials say fatal drug overdoses and alcohol-related deaths are rising. The Baltimore Sun reports that new data released Tuesday revealed that such deaths increased by 9.1% from January to June of this year compared to those months last year. Opioids were responsible for nearly 90% of the 1,326 deaths. Officials from the Maryland Department of Health and the state’s Opioid Operational Command Center said the pandemic is exacerbating people’s addictions as they’re quarantined. “Taken together, the associated social isolation, disruptions of support, impeded access to care, and economic distress have helped to create an extremely dangerous environment for those suffering from substance use disorder,” a report said. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan touted the creation of the Maryland COVID-19 Inter-Agency Overdose Action Plan to help address the connection between substance abuse and the pandemic.\\nBoston: Election officials in the city are expected to approve Fenway Park as an early voting venue when they meet Thursday, after Red Sox owner John Henry offered the storied ballpark for voters hesitant to cast ballots indoors. City officials toured the park and have said it meets their guidelines. If formally cleared as a venue, Bostonians could vote at Fenway on Oct. 17-18. Cities and towns trying to contain the coronavirus pandemic have been looking for large outdoor or well-ventilated alternatives to schools, libraries, community centers and municipal buildings traditionally used for voting. The Red Sox have been playing at Fenway during their truncated 60-game season, but fans haven’t been allowed inside.\\nEast Lansing: Health officials are searching for answers after coronavirus cases linked to Michigan State University students and staff rose to more than 1,200. “I’m kind of feeling like I’m running out of tools in my toolbox. I’ll find some more,” said Linda Vail, Ingham County health officer. Vail could further restrict indoor gatherings and put more large apartments and housing complexes on quarantine. Fraternities and sororities close to campus already have restrictions. Since the semester started, 1,250 cases of COVID-19 have been tied to MSU students or staff. MSU cases comprise 40% of cases reported in Ingham County since March. The rate of positive tests connected to MSU has fallen to 10% from 20%, Vail said. All undergraduate classes are online, and MSU’s residence halls are closed except for a few thousand students.\\nSt. Cloud: Gov. Tim Walz praised staff at South Junior High on Tuesday afternoon as part of his statewide safe learning tour. “We asked you to do what had never been asked before,” Walz said of the planning that went into creating learning models – in person, hybrid or distance – between which districts will transition based on COVID-19 case rates and localized outbreaks. His visit, the 10th on the tour, comes on the heels of the Minnesota State High School League’s decision to bring football and volleyball back for a fall season. “We’re going to have to do our best,” Walz said. “This is where I would put my plug: If you want to see your kids play football and go back to school and your businesses stay open, wear the mask and social distance. It is not a political statement. It is simply science.”\\nJackson: The state Department of Health has reported 552 new coronavirus cases and 24 new coronavirus-related deaths Wednesday. According to state records, the total number of positive cases in Mississippi stands at 94,573. The total number of deaths is 2,870. The state’s highest number of deaths reported in a single day was 67 on Aug. 25. The current number of long-term care facility outbreaks stands at 128. The number of cases reported at long-term care facilities is 5,883. The number of deaths in long-term care facilities is 1,185. As of Monday, the latest information available, 507 people were hospitalized with confirmed infections, 147 in ICUs and 74 on ventilators.\\nO’Fallon: St. Louis County is relaxing some restrictions on youth sports as coronavirus positivity rates have decreased among children in the region, County Executive Sam Page said Wednesday. The new regulations fall short of allowing high-contact high school sports such as football and ice hockey to resume. But Page said if the trend continues to improve, there may be a “path forward” to allow play to begin later this fall. St. Louis County is Missouri’s largest jurisdiction by population, and the county has seen far more COVID-19 cases and deaths than any other place in the state. Though Republican Gov. Mike Parson allowed Missouri to reopen in mid-June, Page, a Democrat, has maintained far stricter guidelines, including limits on youth sports. Those limits have drawn strong criticism from some parents, including protests outside Page’s home and outside the government center in Clayton.\\nHelena: The state is seeing a “remarkable increase” in COVID-19 cases in the past two weeks, Montana’s medical officer said Tuesday, as officials urged residents to step up measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and seasonal influenza. The increase in cases is caused by schools reopening, Labor Day weekend gatherings and the continuing spread of the virus in congregate living settings, such as nursing homes and jails, said Stacey Anderson, state epidemiologist. Montana’s COVID-19 level was stable at about 800 cases per week from when Gov. Steve Bullock issued a mask mandate for most counties in mid-July through early September, said Jim Murphy, head of the Communicable Disease Bureau within the state health department. But last week showed a “remarkable increase in cases,” he said. The 1,240 cases for the week ending Sept. 18 was an all-time high, Murphy said.\\nOmaha: An outbreak of the coronavirus has occurred at a nursing home in the Omaha bedroom community of Blair, with more than two dozen residents and staff infected, health officials said. The Three Rivers Public Health Department reported in a Friday news release the outbreak at Crowell Memorial Home. The facility is licensed for 108 assisted living and skilled nursing beds. Reached Tuesday, the health department said 24 residents and eight staff members had recently tested positive for the virus at the home, which provides senior apartments, assisted living, skilled nursing care and rehabilitation services. Another Blair facility was the site of one of the first nursing home outbreaks in Nebraska. Carter Place temporarily closed after 19 residents and staff tested positive in late March and early April.\\nLas Vegas: About 100 people gathered outside the governor’s private home in the city to protest a mask mandate intended to limit the spread of COVID-19. Political action committee No Mask Nevada planned the Monday demonstration after Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak implemented the order, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. “This governor is trying to destroy the global symbol of American prosperity,” co-founder Ian Bayne said. “The rules make no sense, and the mask just serves to deter and destroy tourism in Las Vegas.” Chair Melissa Blundo said the group wanted to “hit Sisolak at home like he hit us at home.” Surgical masks and cloth masks have been effective at reducing the spread of COVID-19, said Brian Labus, a member of the governor’s medical advisory team. He said the order mandating masks in public is intended to protect people who can become infected from those who do not show symptoms.\\nConcord: The state’s U.S. senators are joining several New England colleagues in seeking federal funding for bus, motorcoach and passenger ferry companies that are struggling because of the coronavirus. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, both Democrats, signed a letter Wednesday led by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island. They are seeking $10 billion in emergency funding for the industry. The cancellation of school field trips, tours and college sports seasons has forced motorcoach companies to furlough or lay off thousands of workers, they said, and privately owned school bus companies have faced significant losses as many states and communities move to remote learning.\\nJersey City: Catholic, Jewish and Muslim day schools throughout the metro area say they’ve been inundated with calls from families who have had it with remote learning and are willing to pay hefty tuitions, ranging from $3,000 to upward of $25,000 annually for in-person learning at a smaller school. Public school districts in the New Jersey, New York and Connecticut suburbs have waffled about their reopening plans, which vary among districts and even within districts between strictly online learning, a hybrid of online and in-person learning, and some fully in-person instruction. In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy announced that public school would open for in-person learning but then gave districts the option to open remotely for a time until they could get their buildings ready for in-person instruction. About one-third of all New Jersey districts have started school on an all-remote basis.\\nSanta Fe: The state has depleted its unemployment benefits trust fund and begun to use federal loans to keep up with claims – spending that can trigger higher taxes if not repaid, a top labor official said Tuesday. Workforce Solutions Secretary Bill McCamley said unemployment trust reserves were exhausted on Sept. 8, and the state has spent about $3 million since then in borrowed federal funds to maintain unemployment benefits. New Mexico’s unemployment rate of 11.4% in August exceeds neighboring states as health officials take gradual steps toward reopening the economy and schools, with most pupils still studying from home. McCamley said about 123,000 people were receiving unemployment benefits as of last week in a state of 2.1 million residents. The tourism and hospitality industry has been especially hard hit, along with oil production and construction.\\nAlbany: Family members of incarcerated New Yorkers and corrections officers are calling on lawmakers and the governor to ensure prisons and jails won’t again face a staffing shortage, barriers to social distancing and dangerous rationing of protective gear ahead of the next COVID-19 surge or pandemic. Testing of people with symptoms at the state’s prisons and New York City jails revealed thousands of COVID-19 infections among incarcerated individuals and guards, who called on the state and New York City to act at a Tuesday legislative hearing. Inmates struggled to socially distance, wash their hands, access hand sanitizer, and get their hands on masks and other face coverings in the early days of the pandemic, according to Jermaine Barrett, who said he was released July 28 from a maximum-security prison north of New York City. “Initially when everything was shut down, more or less we were left to our own devices,” he said.\\nRaleigh: College and professional sports teams may soon be allowed to host a few thousand fans in outdoor stadiums, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced Tuesday. If the state’s coronavirus numbers continue to improve or remain flat, Cooper said he plans to ease the occupancy restrictions for large outdoor entertainment venues starting Oct. 2. Places that can seat more than 10,000 people outside would be able to operate at significantly reduced capacity, 7%, while adhering to the recommended 6 feet of physical distancing. “We plan to take another step toward Phase 3 in the coming days if our progress holds,” Cooper said. Under the updated executive order he plans to announce next week, the Carolina Panthers, whose stadium can seat more than 75,000 people, would be able to host more than 5,000 fans.\\nBismarck: The state Department of Health said Wednesday that it’s adjusting coronavirus testing and contract tracing to address a recent uptick in cases among residents and staff at long-term care facilities. Health officials are prioritizing the testing of that population over all other testing, with every effort to return the results of those tests within 24 hours to fast-track potential isolation of positive residents and staff and quarantine close contacts. The Department of Health said it plans to use emergency medical technicians and others to administer the tests and will make about 200 nurses from its operations center available to staff long-term care facilities as needed. State health officials said Wednesday that seven more people have died of coronavirus complications, all in their 80s or 90s with underlying health conditions. The total number of deaths since the pandemic began is 203 in North Dakota.\\nColumbus: Indoor visits with residents of nursing homes will be allowed once again as cold weather approaches, Gov. Mike DeWine said Tuesday, lifting a ban instituted at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. The Republican governor said at his twice-weekly coronavirus briefing that details will come within a week and that, in the meantime, the state is asking long-term care facilities to examine their air filtration and ventilation systems in preparation. DeWine also said it’s possible the state could institute real-time COVID-19 testing of visitors before they enter a nursing home, although the ability to offer that isn’t available yet. The state has allowed outdoor visits since late July after concerns grew about residents with memory issues such as those that come with Alzheimer’s disease declining because of a lack of interaction. Permitting the practice is up to individual nursing homes.\\nOklahoma City: The number of reported coronavirus cases in the state rose by more than 1,000 for a seventh consecutive day Wednesday, and the total now surpasses 80,000, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The department reported 80,161 total cases and 970 deaths, increases of 1,089 cases and eight more deaths from Monday. The actual number of cases in Oklahoma is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. The department also reported 12,412 active cases and said that 66,779 people have recovered.\\nOntario: An incarcerated man died Monday after testing positive for COVID-19, officials said. The Oregon Department of Corrections said the inmate between 80 and 85 years old died at a hospital. He had been imprisoned at the Snake River Correctional Institution in Ontario, officials said. As with all in-custody deaths, the Oregon State Police have been notified, and the Medical Examiner will determine cause of death, officials said. The man is the seventh inmate in the state to die after testing positive for the disease, according to officials. Since the pandemic began, the Department of Corrections has stopped releasing the names of those in custody who die in connection with the coronavirus. Previously, officials released the person’s name, county of conviction, sentence length and date of death. Officials said they changed the process to balance the desire for transparency with a legal obligation to protect personal health information.\\nHarrisburg: Legislation to loosen Gov. Tom Wolf’s pandemic restrictions on bars and restaurants easily passed the state Senate on Tuesday. The Republican-controlled Senate voted 43-6 for a bill that would end the requirement that customers buy food in order to purchase alcohol and would permit patrons to be served drinks at the bar. It also would permit taverns and restaurants to operate at 50% capacity – or more, if they can meet state and federal social distancing standards or erect appropriate barriers and make it easier for restaurants to adapt adjacent outside areas to serve customers. The bill will need another round of House approval before it can be sent to Wolf’s desk. Wolf’s press secretary, Lyndsay Kensinger, said nearly every state currently has occupancy limits for bars and restaurants, and she said the Democratic governor will veto the bill if he gets it in its current form.\\nProvidence: The state has been added back to the list of states whose residents are required to quarantine for 14 days when traveling to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Those three states add states to their travel advisory lists if new daily cases hit 10 per 100,000 residents over a seven-day average, or if a state has a 10% test positivity rate. Rhode Island had been added to the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut travel advisory list in August but was taken off a week later. Rhode Island was added because the total number of new cases is on the rise, which is a result of the state’s aggressive virus testing, according to a statement from a spokesperson for the state Department of Health. “Rhode Island is doing more testing than any other state in country,” Joseph Wendelken said.\\nColumbia: Some teachers across the state took a personal day Wednesday to fight for safer classrooms amid the pandemic as well as an annual, small raise that was frozen after the economy crashed because of the virus. Unlike May 2019, when SC for Ed brought 10,000 people to the Statehouse for a rally in support of educators that garnered national attention, teachers on Wednesday stayed home and called and emailed legislators. “We didn’t want to put them at any more risk,” said Lisa Ellis, who founded the group. The governor and many lawmakers supported a $3,000, across-the-board raise for teachers in December. But then COVID-19 arrived, the money for the raises disappeared, and now teachers have gone from unappreciated to in fear of their own lives and their families’ lives as Republican Gov. Henry McMaster and others push for in-person teaching five days a week. Local COVID-19 case counts and positive testing levels are higher than the rates discussed for safe schools at the start of the summer.\\nSioux Falls: The state on Wednesday reported 445 new cases of COVID-19, the highest number in a single day since the pandemic started. The state has seen the nation’s second-highest number of new cases per capita over the past two weeks. The rolling average of daily new cases has increased by nearly a third in that time. But Gov. Kristi Noem has continued to say the state is “in good shape” on hospital capacity. The Department of Health also reported a record number of people hospitalized by COVID-19 on Wednesday, with 192 needing hospital care. Those people are occupying 8% of hospital beds in the state, and 41% of hospital beds are open. In a Tuesday tweet, Noem said, “It looks like South Dakota’s #COVID19 spread peaked the latest of just about any state.” But coronavirus cases do not appear to be declining. The state’s seven-day average for COVID-19 test positivity remains among the highest in the nation.\\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee has announced that farm and forestry businesses are getting $55 million in aid funded by the federal coronavirus relief package. The Republican’s office says the Coronavirus Agricultural and Forestry Business Fund aims to help ensure the stability of the food supply chain and agribusiness during the pandemic. The state Department of Agriculture says more than 1,000 applications with more than $335 million in requests were received, and 80% of applications will receive funding. Officials say 60% of recipients were small businesses with annual revenue less than $1 million. The state made it a specific priority to help meat processors, forestry businesses, milk processors and agricultural fairs.\\nAustin: The death toll from the coronavirus in the state approached 15,000 on Tuesday as the total number of deaths across the U.S. topped 200,000, by far the highest in the world. The Texas Department of State Health Services reported 3,964 confirmed new coronavirus cases and 77 more deaths due to COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Health officials say there are more than 716,000 confirmed cases in Texas so far. The death toll is at 14,994. The true number of cases is likely higher, though, because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick.\\nProvo: Utah County has implemented a face mask mandate as COVID-19 cases surge in the state. The county’s health department issued a public health order Tuesday night that requires face coverings in public immediately and expires Oct. 20. The order does not carry any criminal penalties. Cases in Utah County have grown 81% in the past week, according to state health officials. The county accounted for 42% of the state’s cases, despite having only 20% of the state’s population. The mask order came hours after Republican Gov. Gary Herbert announced he would increase pandemic restrictions in two Utah County cities, Provo and Orem. The new rules limit social gatherings to a maximum of 20 people and limit in-person dining options. Herbert has urged residents to wear masks for months but has stopped short of ever implementing a statewide mask mandate. He has instead allowed counties to decide if they need requirements.\\nMontpelier: Schools are poised to move to the next stage of reopening Saturday, including allowing greater use of facilities, more mixing of students and the start of interscholastic sports, the state’s top education official said Tuesday. The Agency of Education chose Sept. 26 as the date to move to Step 3 of the reopening plan so the already-truncated fall sports season could have another weekend of competition, Education Secretary Daniel French said during a regular virus briefing held by Gov. Phil Scott. The move will also allow schools to resume use of common areas such as gymnasiums and cafeterias for their intended purposes, but with smaller group sizes, staggering the use of the areas and ensuring they are properly cleaned between uses, French said. The state’s schools are able to continue their gradual reopening because Vermont has maintained the country’s lowest rate of COVID-19 infections.\\nRichmond: Ten inmates at a prison that holds many elderly and otherwise vulnerable inmates have died from COVID-19, officials said. Deerfield Correctional Center – located in Capron, 69 miles south of Richmond – has an assisted living unit and infirmary and holds many of the state prison system’s elderly and medically impaired offenders, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. Many of the inmates at Deerfield sleep in dormitories, making social distancing difficult if not impossible, the newspaper reports. Figures posted Tuesday by the Virginia Department of Corrections also showed that 36 staff members at Deerfield are positive for COVID-19. Lisa Kinney, a department spokeswoman, wrote in an email that “some staff have temporarily been moved to Deerfield from other facilities, both security staff and nursing staff.”\\nBremerton: Kitsap County has received more than $4.1 million in federal and state funding to help renters and homeowners affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the most money that’s been available for such help in years. Now, local officials are working to make sure that money goes to those who need it, especially among people of color, immigrants and other communities that have been underserved by social services. “My goal is to have every single penny of all of those funding sources spent to help as many households as possible,” said Kirsten Jewell, Kitsap County’s housing and homeless manager. The funds need to be used by the end of the year. The various pools of rental assistance, each with its own eligibility requirements, will be largely distributed through nonprofit Kitsap Community Resources, which manages the county’s coordinated entry system for housing and homelessness services.\\nCharleston: The state’s former public health director and the majority leader of the state Senate say they’ve tested positive for COVID-19. Dr. Cathy Slemp, whom the governor forced out of her role as state health officer in June, said she was quarantined after contracting the virus. The Republican majority leader of the state Senate, Dr. Tom Takubo, also said Tuesday that he had tested positive. The Legislature has been out of session. Gov. Jim Justice on Monday said he wants to ramp up testing to catch more asymptomatic cases as more counties on the state’s color-coded map turn red, the most severe category for virus spread. Slemp resigned June 24 amid a rise in outbreaks. In an op-ed in the Charleston Gazette-Mail, Slemp wrote Monday that residents need to take the virus spread more seriously, instead of the governor repeatedly tweaking the state’s map, as he has done multiple times this month.\\nMadison: State health officials are recommending against trick-or-treating as usual this Halloween because of the coronavirus pandemic. Going house-to-house and having in-person contact is not a good idea, according to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. If individual communities decide to go ahead with traditional trick-or-treating, health officials recommend leaving individual treat bags on the porch for children to pick up. “Even though being outside decreases the risk, being in close contact with people you don’t live with increases the risk of spreading and contracting COVID-19,” the department’s guidance says. Some Wisconsin communities have scheduled trick-or-treat times as usual, with suggestions for taking precautions. Other communities are conferring with their local health departments before making a decision. At least one community in Wisconsin, Antigo, has already canceled trick-or-treating.\\nCheyenne: News reporters on urgent deadlines will need to file a time-consuming public records request in order for the Wyoming Department of Corrections to answer any of their questions after the agency lays off its public information officer, a state corrections official said Tuesday. The policy change set to take effect with the spokesman’s Oct. 8 departure has raised questions about how the department plans to quickly inform the public about urgent safety matters such as escaped inmates or the spread of COVID-19 at correctional institutions. Public records requests in Wyoming usually take several weeks to months for state agencies to fulfill, assuming they aren’t denied for some reason. Wyoming has been struggling to adapt to a one-third drop in state revenue due to weak markets for coal, oil and natural gas – three of the state’s key resources and pillars of its economy – and because of the coronavirus.\\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports\\n'},\n",

Newsom said that roughly 726,000 electric vehicles are on California roads.\\nHow soon is Autopilot coming?Tesla\\'s Elon Musk says it\\'s soon and it\\'s \\'clearly going to work\\'\\nHe added that there are 34 manufacturers of electric vehicles in California, the most of any state in the country, with a combined market capitalization of nearly $500 billion. He said the state\\'s second-largest export is electric vehicles, and the green economy \"broadly defined\" accounts for five times as many jobs in the state as the oil and gas industry.\\n\"This is the next big global industry,\" Newsom said, \"and California wants to dominate it.” He noted that California-based Tesla, for example, had\\xa0said just this week that it expects to produce a $25,000 electric car within three years\\xa0because of advances in battery technology.\\nNewsom said California\\'s move would push U.S. auto manufacturers to \"enhance and advance\" their competitiveness globally and noted that other countries including China, Japan and Israel have also set benchmarks for adopting electric vehicles. He praised Ford as one automaker that \"gets it\" but said others have yet to. \"They are on the wrong side of history,\" Newsom said.\\nThe \\xa0California Air Resources Board will be tasked with developing the regulations mandating that all cars sold in-state beginning in 2035 are\\xa0\"zero emission\" vehicles. The state predicts that the move will result in a more than 35% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and an 80% reduction in certain toxic fumes present in vehicle exhaust.\\nThe board will be responsible for creating additional regulations mandating zero-emission medium- and heavy-duty trucks by 2045 \"where feasible,\" the governor said. Newsom\\'s order also instructs the state to greatly expand charging infrastructure to support the expected surge in electric vehicles.\\nSales of plug-in electric vehicles have grown quickly over the past decade,\\xa0according to the U.S. Department of Energy,\\xa0although the number sold across the country dropped slightly between 2018 and 2019.\\nThe five hottest years on years in recorded human history have been the past five years, and atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions have spiraled well above what scientists labeled as safe levels.

       "  'body': 'WASHINGTON\\xa0– If the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\'s seat on the Supreme Court remains vacant for some time, it won\\'t be anything her colleagues are not accustomed to.\\nWhen Associate Justice Antonin Scalia died suddenly in February 2016, Senate Republicans blocked President Barack Obama from filling the seat, which would have given liberals a majority for the first time in decades. The court muddled through with only eight justices for 14 months.\\nWhen previous justices died in office or retired before their successors could be confirmed, the court similarly moved\\xa0forward with eight members, often for months as Senate confirmation hearings dragged\\xa0on or a nominee was rejected. Most recently, the battle over Brett Kavanaugh\\'s nomination stretched into October 2018, leaving the court shorthanded at the start of its term.\\nMore:Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dies, setting up nomination fight\\nThe high court also is stuck at eight whenever one justice chooses to recuse from considering a case, often because he or she was involved with\\xa0it as a judge or lawyer before joining the court. Justices also step aside on occasion because of a financial, family or personal conflict.\\nCases that are decided unanimously or by lopsided votes aren\\'t affected. But if the justices are deadlocked, at least initially, it can lead them to find a narrow solution that doesn\\'t advance the law very far in any direction.\\xa0\\nIf they do emerge 4-4, they can reschedule the case for the following term, hoping for a ninth justice. That happened in July 2020, when Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch cast the deciding vote that put the eastern half of Oklahoma under Native American criminal jurisdiction. A case raising the same issue could not be decided the previous term because of Gorsuch\\'s recusal.\\nAnd sometimes, the court simply ties up, rendering its ruling almost\\xa0meaningless. The tie vote\\xa0leaves the most recent decision by a lower court intact. There is no new, national precedent created by the nation\\'s highest court.\\nThat happened four times in the months after Scalia\\'s death in 2016, most notably when the court considered President Barack Obama\\'s effort to protect several million undocumented immigrants from deportation.

       "  'body': 'WORCESTER, Mass. – Most people would consider themselves fortunate to survive after contracting the deadly virus from one pandemic. Mildred Geraldine “Gerri” Schappals has survived two of them, more than a century apart.\\nThe 102-year-old Schappals was infected with the Spanish flu in 1918 in Worcester and she tested positive last May for COVID-19 at her assisted living facility in Nashua, New Hampshire, but she overcame both illnesses and is feeling fine.\\nShe has an interesting way of looking at her longevity. She told her daughter Julia Schappals on Friday that she believes she was destined to do something great and she’s still trying to find out what it is and do it.\\n“She’s often said that she thinks Mother Nature believes that she died in 1918 and has forgotten about her,” said Julia from her home in Bedford, N.H.\\nGerri Schappals is hard of hearing so telephone conversations are difficult and visitors to her facility are limited so her daughter asked her a few questions and she relayed the answers for this article.\\nMayor Joseph M. Petty was so touched by her story, he planned to drive to Nashua on Saturday morning to deliver a key to the city of Worcester to her at a garden outside her facility.\\n“This is the city where she lived, grew up,” Petty said. “So it’s a nice thing to do.”\\nPetty has awarded several keys to the city, but as far as he knows this is the first time a Worcester mayor left the state to deliver one.\\n“She has a good wit and she seems tough,” Petty said. “That’s why she’s a survivor and lived a long life.”\\n“I think it’s very thrilling,” Julia said. “She’s certainly a child of Worcester, Massachusetts. She’s a product of their public schools in the 1920s and 1930s. She has very fond memories of growing up there.”\\nShe said her mother told her Friday that she was very honored and delighted, but she couldn’t understand why Petty would drive an hour to see her.\\nShe has most of her marbles at age 102, she said, but “every now and then a few fall out of the bag,” so she isn’t sure if her mother completely comprehends the significance of the honor of receiving the key to the city, but she does appreciate it.\\nNashua Mayor Jim Donchess had also planned to visit her on Saturday, but had to cancel because he recently tested positive for COVID-19.\\nGerri Schappals was born in Worcester as Mildred Lyons on Jan. 18, 1918. The family lived at 12 Bancroft St., off Chandler Street near Park Avenue, in a home that has since been torn down.\\nIn November of 1918, when World War I came to a close, she came down with the flu. So did her mother, Nora, and her teenage brother, Joseph, although his case was far less severe. Gerri was so sick she couldn’t move so her caretakers didn’t bother to pin her diaper after they changed it.\\n“Her mother and she were basically given up for dead,” Julia said, “and the doctor said, ‘They’re not going to live.’”\\nThe flu killed 675,000 Americans, but all three of the stricken Lyons family members somehow survived.\\n“When the doctor came back,” Julia said, “he actually started crying and said, ‘We licked it, we licked it.’ Those were his exact words.”\\nLast May, Gerri ran a low fever for a few days, but the fever spiked and she was taken to the hospital where she was tested for COVID-19. By the time the COVID-19 test came back positive, she felt better.\\n“The story goes,” Julia said, “that she came back into the (assisted living) facility and said, ‘I feel great. When’s lunch?’ And she’s felt fine ever since then.”\\nGerri Schappals fought off breast cancer in the late 1980s and colon cancer in the mid-1990s, but her daughter doesn’t remember her ever having a cold or the flu. Julia Schappals said her mother believes surviving her bout with the Spanish flu fortified her immune system.\\n“Maybe she’s right,” Julia said. “Maybe whoever this master of death is has forgot about her.”\\nGerri credits her love of wine in part for her long life. She’s often said, “Jesus did not change water into wine at Cana so we could look at it.”\\nWhen her mother was young, Julia said, she took piano and dance lessons in Worcester. She had to stop playing piano only a few years ago because of arthritis in her hands.\\nGerri remembers as a child seeing quarantine signs posted on the front doors of Worcester homes with people suffering from scarlet fever inside. She enjoyed going to school in Worcester with children of immigrants who learned to speak English within a few months. She learned some Armenian herself.\\n“She learned several words, probably swear words,” her daughter said with a laugh.\\nGerri Schappals attended Winslow Street Grammar School and graduated from Commerce High School in Worcester and Fitchburg State University, then known as State Teachers College at Fitchburg.\\nShe and her sister Helen taught at Abbott Street School near Foley Stadium in Worcester for a while before she and a few of her college friends moved to Washington, D.C., in the early 1940s to teach. There she met her future husband, Everett “Gus” Schappals. He was a naval officer so they lived in places around the globe, including Guam where she started the island’s first nursery school for children of U.S. servicemen.\\nIn the early 1960s, Gus Schappals left the Navy and the family moved to Nashua. Gerri became an elementary school principal and supervisor of elementary instruction and curriculum for Nashua public schools.\\nGus Schappals believed in health food and vitamins, but he died at age 67 in 1983. On the other hand, his wife had no interest in either, but has lived past 100.\\nJulia Schappals said her mother “would probably run for her life from a carrot so she could get to a cookie. I think she lived on crackers and cheese and hamburgers.”\\nBecause of stenosis, Gerri walks with a cane, but doesn’t use a wheelchair.\\nGerri Schappals told her daughter on Friday that she hopes Worcester stays as unique as it was when she was a child. The mayor driving an hour to give her the key to the city, that’s certainly unique.\\nFollow\\xa0Bill Doyle on Twitter: @BillDoyle15\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'What. A. Week.\\xa0\\nIt\\'s Megan Diskin with the Ventura County Star, welcoming you to October with another round of news.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn California brings you top Golden State stories and commentary from across the USA TODAY Network and beyond. Get it free,\\xa0straight to your inbox.\\nWednesday was the last day for Gov. Gavin Newsom to sign or veto bills that passed in the Legislature this session. CalMatters has been tracking Newsom\\'s decisions with each new pen stroke.\\nAmong the bills signed into law during the last-minute blitz \\xa0were Assembly Bill 1506 and AB 1196. This legislation was introduced in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. The bills ban the use of choke holds and neck restraints by law enforcement and require\\xa0the state attorney general to investigate fatal police shootings of unarmed civilians.\\xa0\\n“None of these bills are easy,” Newsom said as he signed both bills during a Sept. 30 Zoom ceremony with lawmakers and advocates. “But I think under the circumstances, the fact that we were able to get this far is a big deal.”\\nOne of the bills that didn\\'t make the cut\\xa0was AB 1845. It would have created a \"homelessness czar\" or secretary of homelessness to administer the dozens of state homelessness programs. The secretary would have been appointed by the governor.\\xa0\\nA recent poll showed voters were not satisfied with the work Newsom has done to address homelessness and housing in the state.\\xa0\\nCalMatters reports:\\xa0\\nIn his veto message, Newsom wrote that while he sincerely appreciates the “intent of this bill, I do not support this particular vision of organizational restructuring at this time.” The veto marks a near complete reversal of his rather innocuous sounding campaign pledge. Newsom argued in his veto message that a multitude of senior administration\\xa0officials negated the need for a centralized position.\\nState officials unveiled the latest metric for counties to reopen their economies amid the coronavirus pandemic. The equity metric applies to counties with more than 106,000 residents to reduce infections in areas where certain minority groups and poor people live.\\xa0\\nThe requirement also means counties must invest in testing, contact tracing, outreach and services that provide isolation for those in these communities. The new requirement takes effect Oct. 6 and the Los Angeles Times reports it could keep these counties from opening quickly.\\xa0\\nAnother COVID-related mandate was announced this week. The Desert Sun reports that Newsom signed a bill into law requiring additional staffing and reporting requirements in nursing homes.\\nNursing home residents and staff have been vulnerable due to close-quarters environment. The new law also means skilled nursing facilities cannot prevent a long-term care ombudsman from entering a facility.\\xa0\\nMany Americans are reeling from the first presidential debate. One of the standout moments everyone is talking about is President Donald Trump\\'s call for his supporters to head to the polls and keep an eye on things.\\xa0\\nIt\\'s reminiscent of the general election in 1988 in Orange County, according to a CalMatters story. A Republican assemblyman and the county GOP hired uniformed guards to go to polling places in the\\xa0Latino neighborhoods of Santa Ana to monitor illegal voting. They held signs in English and Spanish reminding people that only citizens could vote.\\xa0\\nThe chair of the county\\'s Republican party said after the election that this effort was \\xa0undertaken because there were rumors Democrats were going to bus in undocumented immigrants to flip the assembly.\\xa0\\nThe next day, 12 governors, including Newsom,\\xa0signed a joint statement \\xa0assuring citizens that every valid vote would be counted.\\xa0\\n“Any efforts to throw out ballots or refuse a peaceful transfer of power are nothing less than an assault on democracy,” the governors\\xa0wrote. “There is absolutely no excuse for promoting the intimidation or harassment of voters. These are all blatant attempts to deny our constituents the right to have their voices heard, as guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution, and to know the will of the people will be carried out.”\\nYeah, you read that right. The incident commander of the recently ignited Zogg Fire near Redding said\\xa0the blaze\\xa0could merge with the August Complex Fire, which is the biggest inferno in state history in terms of acres.\\xa0\\nIf the fires team up, the blaze\\xa0 could set a whopping record of more than 1 million acres in size. (This seems fitting for a year like 2020.)\\nThe Redding Record Searchlight reports the south end of the Zogg Fire already\\xa0stretches\\xa0from Shasta County into Tehama County but hadn\\'t gone past crucial Highway 36. The fire\\xa0was about 9 miles away from the August Complex as of Wednesday morning, the incident commander\\xa0said.\\nIn California is a roundup of news from across USA Today network newsrooms.

The\\xa0office includes literature for local Republican candidates and signature\\xa0teal-and-red signs with the group\\'s name.\\nPam Kirby, a former Scottsdale school board member who is on the advisory board for Latinos for Trump, said the centers serve as a public statement from the president that he cares about Latino voters.\\xa0\\n\"He\\'s walking the talk. He doesn\\'t just sit in DC and say, yes, I value the Latino vote. He\\'s actually making financial investments,\" Kirby said.\\nOn its website, Latinos for Trump shares key issues in Trump\\'s platform that the group says align well with Latino voters: freedom, faith, family, economy,\\xa0jobs and opportunity.\\xa0\\n\"Latinos for Trump are mobilizing to re-elect President Donald. J. Trump by sharing the historic gains made in Latino communities as a result of the Trump administration,\" the group\\'s website said.\\xa0\"Re-electing President Trump will ensure economic opportunity, safer communities and religious liberty for generations to come.\"\\nJoe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, has not yet visited Arizona this cycle. His running mate,\\xa0Sen. Kamala Harris, appeared at a virtual event in Arizona on Saturday. Jill Biden, the candidate\\'s wife, also held a virtual event last week in Arizona.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis isn\\'t the first coalition associated with the Trump campaign that\\'s working to make inroads with specific subsets of voters.\\nAnother group that called itself Latter-day Saints for Trump was on hand for\\xa0a visit from Vice President Mike Pence last month as part of efforts by the Trump campaign to reach out to religious voters. The use of the church\\'s name for a group that is not affiliated with the church angered some LDS voters in Arizona, who said the group\\'s name was \"out of bounds.\"\\nAnother group called Women for Trump works to engage female voters.\\nTrump\\'s actions and words, especially on immigration policies involving the border wall\\xa0and the future of Dreamers — young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children —\\xa0have frequently drawn fire from Latinos.\\nWhile he was running for president in 2015, he commented that Mexico wasn\\'t sending its \"best\" to the U.S.\\n\"When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.

Some have criticized the Biden campaign for being slow to reach out to Latino voters, although efforts to engage Latino voters have ramped up in recent weeks.\\xa0\\nFor instance, a\\xa0new ad from the Biden/Harris campaign features Phoenix chef\\xa0Silvana Salcido Esparza, owner of Barrio Cafe, who speaks in both English and Spanish about struggling to keep her restaurant open through the pandemic.\\nHistorically, Latinos have overwhelmingly voted for Democrats.\\xa0In the 2018 midterm elections, 69% of Latinos voted for Democratic candidates in congressional races, compared with\\xa029% of Latinos who voted for Republican candidates,\\xa0according to Pew Research Center.\\xa0\\nBut in Arizona, where the presidential race is seen as increasingly tight, especially for a historically red state, peeling off some voters who traditionally have supported Democrats could pay off.\\nKirby said Latinos for Trump has signed up new voters and met Latinos who typically vote for Democrats who have switched their parties.\\xa0\\n\"They see Latinos standing up as conservatives, and they realize we share the same values. They are switching from Democrat to Republican,\" she said.\\nIn August, the Biden campaign launched the Arizona Latino Leaders Council, a group of more than 30 Latino leaders tasked with engaging Latinos across the state. The group includes\\xa0Rep. Ruben Gallego,\\xa0Rep. Raúl Grijalva, state House Minority Leader Charlene Fernandez and Tucson Mayor Regina Romero, all of whom are co-chairs of the council.\\xa0\\nThe campaign also released an \"agenda for the Latino community,\" which includes priorities that the Biden administration would undertake if they win the office.\\nThese priorities include economic mobility plans, investments in improving health disparities, expanding access to quality education and overhauling the immigration system.\\nHarris held a virtual roundtable event on Saturday with Latino small business owners.\\xa0\\nElection 2020:Kamala Harris tells AZ biz group \\'immigrants have too much at stake\\' to sit out election\\nRomero told The Arizona Republic that the Biden campaign has made strong efforts to reach out to Latino leaders and involve them in engaging Arizona Latino voters instead of parachuting in like candidates sometimes do.\\nShe believes\\xa0the campaign sought input from Latinos and came up with a well-defined policy agenda that will meaningfully benefit Latinos. She pointed to ads running in both English and Spanish. The campaign is dropping off literature at voters\\' homes and finding ways to boost turnout and engagement, she said.\\nThe Arizona advisory council, which she co-chairs, meets every week, she said.\\n\"We\\'re listening to leaders, not just elected leaders, but community leaders throughout Arizona to hear what their interests are and how we can get better to get to the population,\" Romero said.\\nShe sees Trump\\'s visit and attempts to engage Latino voters as hypocritical. She described actions she said have\\xa0hurt Latinos, such as\\xa0Trump\\'s efforts to build a more robust\\xa0border wall, attempts to end protections for Dreamers, pardoning former Sheriff Joe Arpaio on a criminal contempt conviction\\xa0and a failed response to COVID-19.\\n\"The effects of his words should carry strong with Latinos, especially here in Arizona. I think it is maximum hypocrisy of Trump doing outreach to Latinos\\xa0here in Arizona,\" Romero said.\\nSeveral speakers at the Saturday gathering shared how their loved ones or friends often were shocked to hear they voted Republican.\\xa0\\nKirby thanked the crowd for showing that it is \"OK to be a Latino Republican.\"\\nArt del Cueto, the president of the\\xa0National Border Patrol Council, said he talks to family members and asks why they\\'re voting a certain way, and it sometimes sounds like they haven\\'t thought much about the reasons they\\'re voting for a candidate.\\n\"I think a movement like this is important because it gives the individual the right to think for themselves, not just think what somebody in their family had told them, or not just to think what some headlines in the news media told them,\" he said.\\nDel Cueto implored volunteers to make sure they and their loved ones weren\\'t complacent this election. Sitting at home is not an option. Promise yourself to bring 10 voters each to the polls, he told them.\\nSergio Arellano, a veteran and business owner who is on the Latinos for Trump advisory board, said that it used to be rare to find Latino Republicans. But he\\'s seen involvement grow over the past few years as efforts to reach out to Latinos have increased, he said.\\nPocketbook issues like jobs, unemployment and business opportunities come up with voters more than immigration, Arellano said.\\nHe told the group gathered on Saturday that he\\'s had liberals on social media dismissively say that Trump doesn\\'t care about him or other Latino voters.\\nTrump wouldn\\'t be coming to Phoenix to talk to Latino voters\\xa0if he didn\\'t care, Arellano said.\\nTatiana Peña, who is running as a Republican for the Arizona House in Legislative District 27, echoed the idea.\\n\"If he hates Latinos, why is he here?

       "  'body': 'There are few members of Congress as critical about\\xa0Washington politics as Rep. Justin Amash, the Libertarian from Michigan.\\nIn fact, he\\xa0thinks both sides of Congress place more emphasis on theatrical “performance” than the quality of their legislation.\\nIn the last year, he left the Republican Party, considered a run for president as the Libertarian candidate and on July 16\\xa0announced\\xa0he would not\\xa0seek\\xa0reelection.\\nWhile the 40-year-old has not publicly announced his plans for 2021 and beyond, he hinted in an interview\\xa0his professional future may involve trying to educate voters and defend the Constitution from outside Washington.\\n“I want to do what I can to work from the outside to change things because I’ve tried the inside and right now I can’t get much traction,” Amash said. “I want to engage in opportunities that will teach people about Congress, politics and our constitutional system.”\\nAmash entered the political arena in 2008 when he was elected to Michigan’s state House of Representatives. As the child of Palestinian\\xa0and Syrian immigrants, he said he was running to preserve the idea of the American dream.\\nRuth Bader Ginsburg:Ginsburg makes history as the first woman to lie in state at Capitol ceremony\\n“When I first ran for the state House, I wanted to show people that someone can go into the legislature and be independent, successful and have the support of the people,” Amash said. “I saw two parties that were working together to hurt Americans and working against each other to hurt Americans. I wanted to go in and make an impact.”\\nAmash has built his career around stressing small government, independent thought and a love for America. But after 10 years of serving in the House of Representatives, he’s frustrated by what he sees as the theatrics of Congress and partisanship of the national media.\\n“The machinery of Congress is a lot more complicated [than the state legislature] because there is so much entertainment value,” Amash said, noting members of Congress typically “perform”\\xa0 for specific media outlets. “Most members of Congress are pretty kind to each other in private, but in public, they’re performative. It’s very much theater.”\\nAmash cited similar concerns when he announced he was leaving the Republican Party in a 2019 Washington Post op-ed. His message came after months of conflict between Amash, the GOP and the president, a consequence of the congressman’s call for President Donald Trump’s impeachment.\\nMembers of the GOP spoke out against Amash’s accusations — most notably, House Minority\\xa0Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\\n“What he wants is attention in this process,\" said McCarthy in an interview with Fox News. “He’s not a criminal attorney. He’s never met Mueller. He’s never met Barr. Now he’s coming forward with this because this is what he wants.”\\nTrump\\'s SCOTUS nominee:Trump is expected to name Amy Coney Barrett as his nominee to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Supreme Court, GOP sources say\\nTrump also retaliated against Amash on Twitter, calling Amash “a loser who sadly plays right into our opponents hands.”\\n“If he actually read the biased Mueller Report… he would see that it was nevertheless strong on NO COLLUSION and, ultimately, NO OBSTRUCTION,” the president said on Twitter following Amash’s determination that, based on the report, the president had obstructed justice.\\nLater, Trump also cited speculation that Amash was falling behind in his district.\\xa0Amash would have faced a strong field of GOP candidates in the solidly Republican district\\xa0had he chosen to run.\\nBut despite the backlash, the congressman remains outspoken about his opposition to America’s two-party political system. He said many of the federal government’s problems are symptoms of a greater issue. Politicians in the national spotlight used to focus on legislation, he said,\\xa0but now prioritize the media’s perception of their party.\\n“The actual process of legislating is all but forgotten,” Amash said. “The most important part of the process is not that the law is passed, but that everyone was brought into the process. If [a bill] had technical problems, we could go back to the drawing board to amend it.”\\nAmy Coney Barrett:5 things you need to know about Amy Coney Barrett, Trump\\'s likely Supreme Court nominee\\nHe also said the two presidential candidates haven’t emphasized the role of Congress and adhering to the laws it has passed.\\n“If (Joe) Biden wants to win people over, he should be saying he won’t abuse his authority or write laws on his own,” Amash said.\\nAmash said Biden should say \"he will follow the laws Congress has written, but he’s not focused on that, and Donald Trump is certainly not focused on that. These are the symptoms of the underlying problem: the two-party system’s dysfunction and that the process is not followed.”\\nJames Wallner is a political expert from R Street, a conservative and libertarian think tank. He said because the quality of legislation is determined by the voters, trying to increase voter engagement – and supporting political candidates who want change – is a viable strategy to change\\xa0Congress.\\n“If\\xa0the process isn’t working, and the current members won’t fix it, the only solution is to get the current membership of Congress to change its behavior or to [elect] new members who will act differently,” Wallner said in an email.\\nAmash wants to take his message about the need for new approaches in Washington and teach young people how they can change\\xa0politics.\\n“You have to convince young people to value open-mindedness, independence and critical thinking to change culture over time,” Amash said. “I want young people to focus on the process and think about who’s going to address the structure of government.\"\\n2020 election:Many suburban women in Michigan have message for Trump: We want security, not chaos\\nChristian Fong, assistant professor of political science at the University of Michigan, admires Amash’s approach to appealing to young voters on social media and through his ideology. While Amash has not publicly shared what’s next in his political career, Fong predicts he could be successful at a think tank, in a classroom or on talk shows.\\n“I could imagine him teaching, he’d make a fantastic university lecturer as he has a lot of interesting perspectives to share,” Fong said. “He could do that at a university level or teach at a high school, which is where you can really get people while they’re still at a very formative age and figuring out their political identities.”\\nBecause Amash is younger than most members of Congress, Fong said he could have a career for 10 to 15 years and still return to politics — depending on how the parties evolve over time.\\nAmash\\xa0said being a child of immigrants is what continues to drive his career in public service. He still thinks America is a “welcoming and beautiful place” and wants to preserve that sentiment for future generations.\\n“My dad, having come here at 16 as a refugee, was given the opportunity to start a new life,” Amash said. “I’m confident there’s basically no other place in the world where he could have gone and had the kind of success he’s had.”\\nContributing: Todd Spangler\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': '\"Fargo\" is heading out of the snow.\\nFX\\'s acclaimed limited series returns for a fourth season Sunday (9 EDT/PDT; Mondays on Hulu), its first since 2017. The latest chapter in the anthology series shifts the action back in time (to 1950) and to points below its Northern Plains roots (Kansas City, Missouri) for a timely look at the role of immigrants and warring crime bosses.\\xa0\\xa0\\nChris Rock stars as Loy Cannon, a mob boss battling the Italians – led by Josto Fadda (Jason Schwartzman) –\\xa0who, over three decades\\xa0(as seen in an extended prologue), muscled out the Irish and Jews. To maintain peace, the groups trade young children, and their rivals raise them as their own.\\nThe new season lacks a sensational murder in the opening scenes\\xa0but features a narrator,\\xa0Ethelrida Smutny (E’myri Crutchfield), the biracial daughter of funeral\\xa0home operators, who acts as the \"moral center\" of the season, says creator Noah Hawley.\\xa0\\nThe series, based on Joel and Ethan Coen\\'s Oscar-winning 1996 film, shifted production to Chicago from Calgary, Canada, but was sidelined by the coronavirus pandemic, and only shot\\xa0its final episodes last month.\\xa0\\nOur critic\\'s take:Review: Chris Rock leads a slow-but-steady \\'Fargo\\' Season 4\\nRock, 55, and Hawley, 53,\\xa0sat down with USA TODAY earlier this year to talk about the new season, how Rock effectively came to play a version of his real-life murderous\\xa0grandfather, and the identity of this season\\'s hero.\\nWhat did you want to explore going into the new season?\\xa0\\nNoah Hawley: \"Fargo\" is always a story about America, on some level, and I like the idea of going back in time to look at a very seminal period in American history. I had this idea\\xa0about these two families, these two criminal organizations, where they trade their youngest sons in order to keep the peace as an insurance policy. And I thought that was a really interesting dynamic. It created a lot of conflict, but it also was a way to look at assimilation and immigration and this collision that took place in northern cities.\\xa0\\nSince the Irish family is named Milligan, was the seed of it planted with Bokeem Woodbine\\'s Mike Milligan\\xa0in Season 2, or was that just a reference point?\\nHawley: It was a reference point. Bokeem had one of the great performances in the last 10 years. And I just started to think ‘Where did that guy come from?’ So some of the story is a reaction to that. Ben Whishaw\\xa0plays an Irish guy who was first traded to the Hebrews\\xa0and then traded to the Italians, so you have this Irish-Jewish-Italian guy who’s raising this African American kid. So it feels like that’s America at it’s best.\\nAnd Chris, you’ve been a longtime fan of the show?\\nChris Rock: I was a long, long, longtime fan of the show.\\xa0It was just the best show on television. \"Game of Thrones,\" \"Atlanta,\" \"Fargo,\" in any particular order you want them. \"Fargo\" is the hardest one because it starts over;\\xa0it’s a new show every freakin’ year.\\nSo how did this come about?\\nRock: He called up, he wanted a meeting, and, honestly, I didn’t even think he was calling me for \"Fargo.\" Half of my calls, people offer me acting roles, but the other half are like,\\xa0‘Hey, can you do my kid’s bar mitzvah,’ you know? But my agent had to make me go to the meeting.\\nHawley: I came up with the story;\\xa0there wasn’t a script, I was making (2019 film) \"Lucy in the Sky,\" and Chris came to the set, and I just pitched him.\\xa0When I thought of this guy, I thought of Chris.\\xa0Rock: I think the day I went in – show-business problems\\xa0–\\xa0I wasn’t nominated for an Emmy that day (for a Netflix stand-up special),\\xa0and then he offers me and I’m like ‘Oh I’d much rather have this than an Emmy nom.\\'\\nYou’ve done dramatic roles before, but not a lot of them,\\xa0so how was that experience for you?\\nRock:\\xa0I mean, I like comedy that’s rooted anyway. I love Steve Martin, but I’ve never been the wild and crazy, wacky guy. I kinda like to have a real bottom to any comedy I do, anyway. The character works for me because I’m basically playing my grandfather. I was born in South Carolina, my parents were born in South Carolina, my grandparents. So this guy is kinda the same age as my grandfather. My grandfather wasn’t a mob boss, but he was a preacher, he was a public figure. My father had nine brothers, five sisters. Probably 70% (of them were) in jail, so I’ve been around that stuff a lot. I sent my mother a picture of my character with the hair and everything and she’s ready to cry. She said:\\xa0‘You look like your grandfather.’\\nNoah, you always come up with the best character names. Josto\\xa0Fadda, Jason’s character,\\xa0is obviously subject to discrimination himself\\xa0but is racist.\\xa0What\\'s this\\xa0season trying to say about\\xa0immigration, and how relevant is it to\\xa0what’s going on today?\\nHawley: There’s a moment in the script where our narrator, 16-year-old Ethelrida, says ‘If America is a nation of immigrants, how does one become American?’ I think it’s just important to remember that my grandmother escaped from Russia with her family when she was 5. They had 10 kids running through the woods and made it to the boat with nine of them. They came over, moved into Brooklyn, and\\xa0my grandmother slept on two kitchen chairs pulled together. Two weeks after they got there, one of the remaining nine kids was shot by a neighbor. You know, this was the American experience, and somehow they figured out a way to put a roof over their head and money in their pockets.\\nAnd the next generation was better off, and the next generation was better off after that, and we shouldn’t forget that that’s what our country is. What was exciting to me about this idea of these families that trade sons\\xa0is\\xa0how do you assimilate into that family? It’s not just some abstract thing;\\xa0it’s a very different experience because (Cannon\\'s) family accepts this kid into their mitts, he eats with them at the table, but in (Fadda\\'s)\\xa0family, this kid’s up in the attic;\\xa0it’s very different.\\nHow deeply does the Ethelrida\\xa0storyline intersect with the mobsters\\'?\\nHawley: It’s a really critical part of it, she’s the moral center of the show. Everyone else is kind of a criminal. And if you look at the moral spectrum of \"Fargo,\" the movie, where you’ve got Marge and she’s all good on the one end and Peter Stormare on the other who’s evil and Bill Macy in the middle, like ‘Which way is he gonna go?’ Ethelrida is definitely\\xa0the moral center. We invest in Loy, obviously, and he feels like our hero, but as Chris said, he’s a criminal and he did agree to give up his son. There’s still part of him that’s calculating in a way that isn’t moral all the time. Part of it is for the audience to have that discovery of ‘I’m rooting for this guy, but maybe I shouldn’t be rooting for this guy.’\\nRock: My grandfather’s a preacher, but he also killed a man. My real grandfather. Preachers aren’t the most faithful of husbands. People that aren’t faithful, people that cheat,\\xa0get really jealous. He thought my grandmother was sleeping with a guy next door and he threatened the guy – \"if you take one more step in my yard, I\\'ll blow you away\" –and the guy took one more step. I was a kid,\\xa0so I’m gonna say this was in the early ‘70s. I don’t know exactly what happened, but I think it was manslaughter. (He served time.)\\xa0\\nDo you have an idea for a fifth season?\\nHawley: I don’t. I didn’t have an idea for a fourth season that was three years later. What’s nice about FX is that if I say this is it, it’s it. If I call in a couple years and go ‘Well, we could do this,’ they’ll be excited to get that call.\\nRock: Noah’s the Larry David of FX.\\nHawley: There’s more and more programming every day.\\xa0If I don’t have the delusion that this can be the best thing on TV, I don’t want to make it.\\nSo you’re not planning anything, but you haven’t closed the door?\\nHawley: Yeah, of course. I love making them. There’s nothing else that I write or make that feels like this, where you’re exploring drama and comedy and philosophy and crime. It’s so rich in so many ways. Sometimes there’s a UFO, sometimes there’s a magic bowling alley. There’s nothing else I can get away with where I can ground it but do all of that, so I love it.\\nWhat do you most like about doing the show?\\nRock: Doing this\\xa0show is\\xa0hard, man. A lot of intricate dialogue. It’s 11\\xa0episodes, so it’s like shooting three movies at one time. It’s a real job. This is the hardest show-business job I’ve had.\\nDoes this mean you won’t easily be convinced to do something like this again?\\nRock: I mean, if somebody writes me a part like this.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'No one is coming to save us, except ourselves.\\xa0\\nThe death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg feels like the death of everything we have fought for over so many years.\\xa0We are women of a certain age and privilege.\\xa0We are the women who pored over \"Our Bodies, Ourselves\" in discovery of our own physical selves. We are the women who formed consciousness-raising groups and urged each other on to be ambitious and powerful. We are the women who devoured Ms. Magazine, hoping to feel less crazy and more affirmed. We are the women who met and marched, organized and mobilized to protect our rights and to determine our own future. We are the women who broke glass ceilings but remain just on the verge of breaking the last one.\\nGinsburg’s mother told her to be a lady, but an independent one; that she might find Prince Charming but she should always be able to fend for herself.\\xa0Femininity became feminism, the ability to enjoy dressing up, but to choose what to wear. To claim the right to be your authentic self and to be able to choose your destiny. Of course, her choices were challenged. Our choices were challenged.\\xa0\\nMen, who held power, worried they would somehow be emasculated by the rise of women.\\xa0They worried we would take their jobs, diminish their clout, rewrite the rules and claim our place in the world.\\nBut men with more confidence wanted their daughters to be educated, to be able to rise, to be all that they could be. We were lucky to have fathers who urged us on even while our mothers struggled with their own identities, urging us to find what they hoped for themselves. We could establish credit in our own names.\\xa0And, indeed many of us didn’t change our last names when we were married, even knowing that we retained our father’s, not our mother’s name.\\nRethink life tenure:Supreme Court term limits do not require a constitutional amendment\\nWe found the doctor who would provide us birth control before it became commonplace and the clinics where we would make decisions about bearing children after the landmark Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade, putting a end to illicit backroom deaths. Progress seemed to know fewer limits — Harvard Law School, where\\xa0Ginsburg attended as one of only nine women, boasted more women students than men in its 2019 class.\\nFor all of us who fought so hard decades ago, 2016 had us confronting our fears — again.\\xa0The electoral college election of Donald Trump, and the dystopian words of his inaugural speech did not bode well for equality for women — or for men, for that matter, and certainly not for people of color, for immigrants or for marginalized people.\\nBut my lawyer daughter came to Washington with friends to march yet again, joining millions across the globe.\\xa0The young women urged me to make my exasperation my sign — \"I Can’t Believe I Am Protesting This BS Again.\" And off we went to fight again filling the streets of Washington and towns everywhere.\\nI teach graduate students now at the Harvard Kennedy School, this semester running a course in policy design and delivery.\\xa0I tell my students that policy is almost by necessity iterative, that change in the world is not linear, and rare is the occasion that a policy decision achieves permanent or final success.\\nOne death throws the country into chaos:Ginsburg flap shows Supreme Court, justices are too important\\nTo wit, World War I was to be the war that ended all wars, and yet 21\\xa0short historical years later, we had World War II. So\\xa0it is true in the fight for the\\xa0rights of women, the rights of all people to live equitably with their human and civil rights intact and respected.\\xa0Indeed, the disparities of race seemingly re-acknowledged in this time of coronavirus and justice reform, have been thus since the beginning of what became the United States of America.\\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death came on Rosh Hashana, one of the High Holy days of the Jewish calendar.\\xa0As others have noted, it is thought to be a mark of the righteous to die at this time and Ginsburg was indeed righteous.\\nIt made me think as well of the story of Ruth in the Bible, of those haunting words to her mother-in-law Naomi, “Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay.” Justice Ginsburg brought so many of us justice. Devastatingly hard as it is, we must go where she did and stay with the fight, winning for however long it takes.\\nWendy R.

       "  'body': 'The news today is distressing. People are inundated with endless updates about the COVID-19 pandemic, violence associated with protests, the ongoing conversation about policing in American society and strong political divisions during an election year.\\nIt\\'s not surprising then that American adults surveyed this summer reported increased stress, depression and substance abuse.\\nIn this sea of negativity, it is easy to forget the power of people to make the world a better place. Right now, ordinary people around the country are working together to help others. These efforts are crucial not only to\\xa0help\\xa0those in need but to\\xa0maintain\\xa0a free society.\\nThe centrality of civil society — private people coming together to effectively solve problems — is a defining feature of American life. In the 1830s, Alexis de Tocqueville, a French diplomat and political scientist, traveled throughout America and published his observations in his book, \"Democracy in America.\"\\nHe noted that America was highly decentralized and that diverse people joined together to solve a variety of problems. As Tocqueville wrote, “Americans of all ages, conditions and all dispositions constantly unite together” to solve community problems. These collective efforts played two important roles that\\xa0remain relevant today.\\nThe first was resolving immediate problems facing communities. The specifics of these challenges are context dependent and require localized solutions. People have the power to come together to effectively help their fellow community members by leveraging their local knowledge of the best way to provide value-added assistance.\\nToday, such efforts can be found throughout America.\\nPeople’s Grab-N-Go, a food distribution program in Washington Park, Chicago, emerged in the wake of the suspension of the city’s public school food distribution program at the end of May. In response, members of the community came together to create a network to distribute food and toiletries to those in need.\\nA key part of the initiative’s success was reliance on members of the community who had a sense of local needs. Similar groups exist throughout the country.\\nIn the Washington, D.C. area, local groups have emerged to assist members of the community who are high-risk or quarantined. The type of assistance provided varies greatly and includes running errands, delivering groceries, assisting with child and pet care, and connecting with those isolated, over technology, to provide human interaction.\\nIn addition to immediate problem solving, Tocqueville emphasized a second benefit of collective efforts — they allow people to interact with one another and learn to live with others who hold diverse views. Working together requires respecting different perspectives and understanding where others are coming from.\\nThese interactions generate the direct effects of providing immediate assistance, but also the indirect effect of learning about others. As Tocqueville put it, “Sentiments and ideas renew themselves, the heart is enlarged, and the human mind is developed only by the reciprocal action of men upon one another.”\\nHe emphasized that there was nothing inherent in self-governing democracies to facilitate this understanding of others. It required effort and commitment on the part of citizens through participation in associations.\\nAs the daily news make clear, Americans face real challenges. Many are frustrated by the ineffectiveness of the federal government to address these issues. Perhaps the answers are not to be found in Washington, D.C. As Tocqueville emphasized, the most effective solutions to the challenges we face are often found in our own communities. The good news is that the Tocquevillian spirit of association is alive and well in America.\\nWhile small-scale local efforts to help our fellow human beings will rarely make national headlines, they are crucial for helping those in need and for preventing political differences from devolving into democratic decay.\\nDuring election season it is important to remember that being a participant in a self-governing democratic system involves much more than voting. It involves embracing the Tocquevillian challenge of helping those in need while fostering an environment of mutual respect and learning that appreciates a diversity of views and interests.\\nThe future of a free and liberal society depends on meeting this challenge head on.\\nChristopher Coyne is professor of economics at George Mason University and a senior fellow at the Institute for Humane Studies.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'The Rev. Robert Graetz,\\xa0whose support of the 1955-56 Montgomery Bus Boycott made him a target of segregationists and sparked a career dedicated to social justice, died Sunday,\\xa0his daughter Meta Ellis said. He was 92.\\nGraetz had been in hospice care.\\xa0\\nGraetz, who ministered to the majority-Black Trinity Lutheran Evangelical Church in Montgomery, Alabama, helped organize the early stages of the boycott and helped drive people to and from work.\\nGraetz was the only\\xa0white clergyman\\xa0to support the boycott, and like other participants in the boycott, the reverend and his family\\xa0persisted in the face of harassment, terrorism, and death threats that extended to their preschool children. Vandals poured sugar in their gas tank; slashed their tires and sprayed acid over their cars. White students on segregated school buses shouted \"n---r lover\" at Graetz and his wife, Jeannie, as they walked the street.\\xa0\\nThe family home was bombed twice, and while arrests were made, no one was ever convicted.\\xa0Graetz\\xa0often became emotional remembering the bombings in later years.\\n“People often said we had courage,” he said in 2001. “There were times when I was scared to death.”\\nRobert Graetz was born on May 16, 1928, in Charleston, West\\xa0Virginia. His father worked as an engineer for the Libbey-Owens-Ford Co., a glass manufacturer. In the mid-1940s, Graetz entered Capital University\\xa0in Bexley, Ohio, where he helped organize a “campus race relations club.” Walter White, the longtime leader of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), once spoke to the club and said race relations were improving because of the growing presence of whites in civil rights battles.\\n“Naturally I just beamed,” Graetz told the Advertiser in 1956, “because that depiction really fit me.”\\nThe Lutheran Church faced a shortage of Black clergy in the 1950s, and Graetz was asked to minister at majority-Black churches. He started as a student pastor at Community Lutheran Church in Los Angeles in 1952. After earning a divinity degree from what is now Trinity Lutheran Seminary in Columbus, Ohio, Graetz went to the 210-member Trinity Lutheran Church in Montgomery in June\\xa01955.\\nThe church also sponsored meetings of the NAACP Youth Council, through which Graetz met Rosa Parks.\\n“When we met Rosa, we just fell in love with her,” Graetz said in 2015. “She was such a great lady, and so brave. She could really lead those kids and they responded to her.”\\nGraetz had spent barely six months as the pastor of Trinity Lutheran Evangelical Church in 1955 when Black leaders in the city organized the boycott following Parks\\' arrest on Dec. 1. The Sunday after the arrest and first organizational meetings, Graetz encouraged his congregation to unite behind the protest.\\n“Let’s try to make this boycott as effective as possible\\xa0because it won’t be any boycott if half of us ride the buses and half don’t ride,” Graetz told the congregation. “So if we’re going to do it, let’s make a good job of it.”\\nFrom 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. each day, he drove a Chevrolet in support of the boycott, shuttling as many as 50 people a day between home and work.\\nAs a member of the Montgomery Improvement Association, Graetz organized car pools and raised money to pay for gas and automotive expenses.\\xa0\\nWhile the Graetzes were not the only white people involved in the boycott —\\xa0Clifford and Virginia Durr provided legal and financial support — the young couple were the only white members of the clergy to publicly support it. Graetz\\xa0 wrote letters to fellow clergymen on stationery with a quote from Acts 8:26 (“And the Angel of the Lord spake unto Phillip saying: ‘Arise, go toward the South’”), asking\\xa0them to consider this matter “prayerfully and carefully, with Christian love. Our Lord said, ‘Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.’”\\nHe was not successful. The association representing white ministers in Montgomery refused Graetz’s invitation to a talk from the Rev. Martin Luther King about the boycott.\\nMontgomery\\'s larger\\xa0white community also shunned the Graetzes. As they endured vandalism and verbal harassment, Robert and Jeannie\\xa0received\\xa0notes suggesting that their young children could be shot while playing outside. Family members suggested sending the children out of state; they refused.\\nLaw enforcement also targeted the minister.\\xa0On Dec. 19, 1955,\\xa0 while picking up five passengers, Graetz was stopped by Montgomery County Sheriff Mac Sim Butler and accused of picking up passengers in a taxi zone. The sheriff ordered him to follow him to the county jail, where Graetz was placed in a deputy sheriff’s office.\\nA person who Graetz assumed was a deputy sheriff told him, \"We like things the way they are here. We don’t want anybody trying to change them.”\\n“Arriving here, I realized I had no idea what it would be like to be Black and live life in daily repression,” Graetz said in 1999. “I had no idea what it would be like to be told day after day and year after year that you are a nobody, that you have no value.”\\nThe terror escalated in August 1956, a few days after the white ministers rejected Graetz\\'s invitation to meet with King.\\xa0Graetz was on a trip with his family and Rosa Parks at the Highlander Folk School, a training ground for civil rights activists\\xa0in northeastern Tennessee, when he got a call from a reporter asking for a comment about his home being bombed.\\nIt was the first news Graetz had about the attack, which tore the door off and shattered a window.\\xa0\\nFar from providing support, city leaders went on the offensive. Mayor W.A. Gayle accused the Montgomery Improvement Association of setting off the bomb to boost interest in the boycott.\\n“We are inclined to wonder if out-of-state contributions to the boycott have been dropping off,” he said. “Perhaps this is just a publicity stunt to build up interest of the Negroes in the campaign.”\\nGraetz called the mayor’s comments “foolishness,” and King rejected all of Gayle’s premises.\\nThe boycott ended in December after Montgomery’s bus system was ordered desegregated. The attacks did not. On Jan. 10, the Graetzes; their children, including their 9-day-old son and the Rev. Graetz’s mother\\xa0were at home when a bomb exploded on their front lawn. Shortly afterward, a much larger bomb, consisting of 11 sticks of dynamite, was found,\\xa0which could have killed the entire family\\xa0had it gone off.\\xa0\\nThe Graetzes were one of several individuals targeted that evening. The Rev. Ralph Abernathy was also bombed, and several African-American churches were also targeted. Arrests took place, but no one was ever convicted.\\nIn 1958, the family moved to minister at a Black church in Columbus, Ohio.\\xa0Graetz worked in Ohio, Kentucky, California and Washington, D.C., where Graetz worked as a lobbyist for marginalized individuals for 13 years.\\nRobert and Jeannie Graetz returned to Montgomery in 2005 for the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, then moved\\xa0to the city permanently in 2007. They worked for Alabama State University and held regular symposiums on civil rights issues. Graetz also wrote semi-regular columns for The Advertiser, part of the USA TODAY Network.\\n“What shall be done about the pockets of abject poverty scattered throughout our nation, disproportionately African-American?” he wrote in 2008. “Until progress has been made in ensuring more satisfying and productive lives to those who are the most vulnerable in our society, we cannot fully resolve the problems that divide our various groups.”\\nThe couple remained politically active and outspoken, even as the Rev. Graetz entered hospice care. In\\xa02011, they opposed Alabama’s House Bill 56, which criminalized undocumented immigrants’ lives in the state. Graetz also condemned white nationalist violence at Charlottesville in 2017\\xa0and sharply condemned President Donald Trump’s reaction to it.\\nGraetz is survived by his wife,\\xa0seven\\xa0children, 27\\xa0grandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren, and one great-great-grandchild.\\n“Some time ago I read that the first requisite of a successful missionary was that he become color blind,” Graetz told the Advertiser in 1956, near the start of the Bus Boycott. “I figured that the same was true of my work here. I know that I shall be criticized for my stand. I may even suffer violence. But I cannot minister to souls alone. My people also have bodies.”\\n'},\n",

The move was among a number of actions announced to lower the state’s greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution.\\nOwning, operating and selling previously owned gasoline-powered cars will still be allowed past 2035.\\n\"Of all the simultaneous crises that we face as a state and I’d argue as a nation — for that matter from a global perspective — none is more important, none is more forceful than the issue of the climate crisis,\" Newsom said.\\nMandating that all cars sold in-state beginning in 2035 are \"zero-emission\" vehicles\\xa0will result in more than a 35% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and an 80% reduction in certain toxic fumes present in vehicle exhaust, according to state predictions. Newsom\\'s order says that the state will need to greatly expand its charging infrastructure to support the surge in electric vehicles.\\nGot questions about all this? Here\\'s a handy Q&A.\\nAlso on the environmental chopping block are new hydraulic fracking permits, which Newsom hopes to phase out by 2024.\\nHydraulic fracking is a technique in which water, sand or chemicals are injected into the earth to fracture formations and loosen up oil, which Newsom said accounts for about 2% of the state\\'s oil production. Newsom said while he lacks the power to end fracking, he plans to work with the legislature to legally phase out new fracking permits.\\nWhat the governor didn\\'t directly address was what the state planned to do about the process of steam fracking or high-pressure cyclic steaming, in which scalding steam, without chemicals, is injected below ground to fracture formations. This more widely used technique for extracting oil has been linked to worker and wildlife injuries and deaths and hundreds of oil spills.\\nOver the past two decades, Chevron and other oil companies have earned millions harvesting oil from spills linked to high-pressure cyclic steaming, according to a recent investigation by The Desert Sun and ProPublica.\\nNewsom and California Natural Resources Secretary Wade Crowfoot said a moratorium had been placed on steam fracking while studies are completed about whether it can be done safely. However, the moratorium only covers new permits for high-pressure cyclic steaming and does not affect oil companies with existing permits. The governor said a draft of the study on steam fracking would be complete soon.\\nJoseph I. Castro was named by the California State University trustees as the new chancellor of the CSU system on Wednesday, making him the first Mexican American and native Californian to lead the nation’s largest four-year public university system.\\nA grandson of Mexican immigrants who was raised by a single mother, Castro, 53, is a seasoned university administrator, having been president of CSU Fresno since 2013. Prior to that, he served as a professor of family medicine and vice chancellor of student academic affairs at the University of California, San Francisco.\\n“I’m excited and honored to be the first California native and first Mexican American to serve as a chancellor of the California State University,” Castro said. His voice quivered with emotion as he thanked his mother and his relatives, some of whom he said were watching a livestream of the CSU trustees\\' meeting. To his family he said, “I love you all.”\\nWithin the 23-campus CSU system, Latino students are the largest ethnic group at 43%, followed by white students at 22%, Asian students at 16% Asian and Black students at\\xa04%.\\nCastro\\'s new job begins in January.\\nSouthern California Edison announced on Wednesday a $1.16 billion settlement with insurance companies over the 2017 Thomas Fire and 2018 Montecito mudslide disasters in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. As part of the agreement, Edison made no admission of wrongdoing or liability.\\nMore than 100 plaintiffs, among them insurance carrier families and financial institutions, sued the utility company, alleging that its negligence caused the devastating fire and resulting mudslides.\\nThe Thomas Fire burned for nearly 40 days, destroying 1,063 structures and claiming the lives of two people. Approximately a month after the fire started, heavy rains triggered mud, trees and rocks to slide off the hills above Montecito, destroying more than 100 homes and killing about two dozen people. The mudslide lawsuits alleged the disaster would not have happened if the Thomas Fire hadn\\'t stripped the vegetation from the hillside.\\nInvestigators determined that power lines owned by Edison arced and made contact with one another in high winds, which caused “molten aluminum particles” to fall to the ground, where dry vegetation caught fire.\\nWednesday\\'s announcement was the second settlement stemming from the Thomas Fire and mudslide litigation. In November, Edison agreed to pay $150 million to public entities in both counties over the incidents.\\xa0\\n“We are making significant progress toward resolving wildfire-related litigation,” said Pedro J. Pizarro, president and CEO of Edison\\'s parent company, Edison International.\\nThe Guardian reports that investigators are looking into the possibility that the Bobcat Fire, one of the largest in Los Angeles County history, was sparked by Southern California Edison utility equipment.\\nAccording to the article, Edison has surrendered a section of an overhead conductor from a transmission facility that was located near the origin of the fire. And last week, Edison told California\\'s Public Utilities Commission that this particular equipment had experienced an issue five minutes before the initial report of the fire on Sept. 6.\\nHowever, Edison spokesman\\xa0David Song\\xa0said cameras captured a more distinct timeline, showing smoke developing in the area before the Edison issue.\\nCNBC reports that California-based electric car maker Tesla is suing the United States government and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer for imposing \"arbitrary\" tariffs on parts imported from China.\\nAnd while we\\'re on the subject of cars, the Los Angeles Times reported\\xa0that a\\xa0new poll shows Californians are not sold on the idea of letting\\xa0Uber, Lyft and other app-based driving companies override AB 5 and employ their drivers\\xa0as independent contractors.\\nSpeaking of polls, according to a recent one of Californians, as reported by ktla.com, only 37% of voters said\\xa0they supported Proposition 21, which aims to give cities and counties more power to implement rent control in their communities.\\nIn California is a roundup of news from across USA Today network newsrooms.

       "  'body': 'As we careen toward the 2020 election, I cannot help imagining how this moment, and the five years leading up to it, will be conveyed in history textbooks. I want to believe the political venom will dissipate and the truth will prevail. But that’s probably naïve — especially considering that history and how we teach it are\\xa0embedded in our political cultural wars.\\nJust last week, President Donald Trump threatened to cut federal education funding to the state of California if schools there are found to include in the teaching of U.S.\\xa0history the New York Times’ 1619 Project, its much debated exploration of chattel slavery and its deep and lasting effects.\\nThat the teaching of this national disgrace is controversial is itself disgraceful; it is also unsurprising. Sen.\\xa0Tom Cotton of Arkansas has proposed the “Saving American History Act of 2020,” which could more appropriately be called the “Saving America’s Cover-up and Delusions of Purity Act.”\\nI do not know if President Trump or Sen.\\xa0Cotton are merely staging political stunts in an election year. Or whether either believes it acceptable to teach our children anything at all about the grotesque institution of slavery or the enslaved Africans who perished by the thousands or those who somehow survived for generations of misery and agony until, after nearly 250 years, their descendants were given legal freedom and then denied civil or human rights for the next century and beyond. I don’t know precisely what the objections are to ensuring that our children understand this about their country’s history.\\nIs it embarrassment? Are they afraid that our children won’t adopt the unquestioning patriotism they seem to think is the only way to express a love for this country? Or do they think our children can’t bear to know the crimes and hypocrisies? Or is it fear of losing the delusion of white supremacy that includes the bizarre belief in moral superiority?\\nIt is not unreasonable to argue that we ought to be reasonable burdening our children with the torrent of blood and tears that darken the timeline of our country. How much is too much and at what age should children know how much of the ugliness? These are fair questions for parents and educators and the lawmakers who ultimately oversee the public education system.\\nAbout 20\\xa0years ago I was recruited to teach the American Social History Project curriculum which introduced high school students to social history — studying\\xa0the past from the perspective of\\xa0workers, soldiers, immigrants, indigenous people, enslaved people\\xa0and other disenfranchised Americans. Using the works of Herbert Gutman, Stephen Brier, Howard Zinn\\xa0and other social historians, we\\xa0helped students understand that inhumanity and injustice are often many-faceted and understanding the complexities can be liberating.\\nCenturies of stunted advancement:I used to oppose reparations for slavery, but now I understand why they make sense\\nNo one in Washington or anywhere else raised a fuss about any of it and most of the students found this approach engaging and empowering. They\\xa0came to see themselves and their lives as more meaningful once they stopped perceiving history as the actions of powerful white men. But not all the kids were enthusiastic.\\nI remember one young man who complained that it was all too depressing. Why couldn’t we learn more of the great things about our country? He’d had squalor and misery enough growing up in perils and poverty. He wanted to be uplifted at school. He wanted to learn about all the great accomplishments of our country. Something on which to hang his own personal hopes.\\xa0\\nI found his plea compelling and became a better teacher for it — committed to providing something positive and aspirational amid all the ugly realities we were studying.\\nEver since then I’ve embraced that impulse as much as I’ve tried to embrace the truth. Our children can feel proud of our country even as they discover the worst of our past. The teaching of slavery or any other American atrocity should never be an attack on children of any ethnicity or gender.\\nThe best thing about children is that they will one day grow up and take our place. That is humanity’s greatest hope — and I cannot imagine a moment in history that better illustrated that.\\nEllis Cose:We\\'re trapped in an obscene distortion of democracy. But we don\\'t have to be.\\nBut we have to arm them with truth and the courage to always confront it.\\nKids know when they are being deceived. They sense the cowardice of adults who won’t themselves confront difficult truths. When we lie to and conceal from children we lose their respect and we cease to be relevant. That’s when kids sleep through U.S. History and cheat to pass a class unworthy of their attention.\\nThe winners (of wars and elections) may — as the now tired hypothesis goes — get to write the history books. But “saving history” by covering up the uncomfortable parts is the desperate act of losers.\\nLarry Strauss has been\\xa0a high school English teacher in South Los Angeles since 1992.

       "  'body': 'Amy Coney Barrett of South Bend, Indiana, may soon become a household name.\\xa0\\nThe appeals court judge and University of Notre Dame law professor is likely to be\\xa0President Donald Trump’s pick\\xa0to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\\nBarrett was on the shortlist to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy\\xa0when he retired in 2018. Trump instead\\xa0chose conservative judge Brett Kavanaugh.\\nHere\\'s what you need to know about Barrett:\\nBarrett, 48, was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. Her mother was a French teacher and her father was a lawyer. After graduating from the University of Notre Dame\\'s law school at the top of her class, she worked as a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and other federal court justices before returning to her alma mater as a law teacher.\\xa0\\nBarrett has been described by colleagues and friends as a dedicated mom of seven children, two of whom were adopted from Haiti. Her youngest child has Down Syndrome.\\nIn October 2017, with just an hour to go until she was voted into the 7th District Court of Appeals by the U.S. Senate, Barrett was outside trick-or-treating\\xa0with her kids.\\xa0\\nBarrett’s\\xa0strong Catholic faith has placed\\xa0her firmly in the eye of\\xa0the national debate\\xa0over who will replace Ginsburg, and what ideology the new judge will bring.\\nHer confirmation hearing in 2017 became a lightning rod for conservative outcry after California Sen. Dianne Feinstein questioned whether or not Barrett could separate her religious faith from her duty as a judge. \"The dogma lives loudly within you,\" Feinstein said during the hearing. Barrett insisted that her professional beliefs and her religious beliefs would be kept separate.\\nAmy Coney Barrett: What she said about politics in courts\\nThree years later, Barrett\\'s rulings have invited similar questions. But those who know her say it\\'s unfair to narrowly define her.\\xa0“It’s been disorienting to see the smartest person I know reduced to how she might vote on [abortion], when she is so much more than that,”\\xa0Alex Blair, an attorney and one of Barrett\\'s former University of Notre Dame students, told the South Bend Tribune.\\nAt her home in South Bend, Barrett is far from a polemic figure. She is an active community member\\xa0who is\\xa0highly regarded by students and staff at\\xa0Notre Dame.\\xa0\\nBarrett was named \"Distinguished Professor of the Year\" three separate years, a title decided by students. She is also active in the community, having held a board position at South Bend\\'s Trinity School, and a spot on the St. Joseph Catholic Church Parish Pastoral Council.\\nNotre Dame President Rev. John Jenkins issued a statement on Saturday praising Barrett as a potential pick for the Supreme Court. \"The same impressive intellect, character and temperament that made Professor Barrett a successful nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals would serve her equally well as a nominee for the nation\\'s highest court,\" said Jenkins.\\nBarrett\\xa0is part of a\\xa0Christian\\xa0religious group\\xa0called People of Praise that\\xa0started in South Bend\\xa0and\\xa0now has a presence\\xa0across the U.S.\\xa0and in Canada and Jamaica.\\xa0The group\\xa0itself is not a church, but its members follow a movement called “charismatic renewal” and believe\\xa0in speaking in tongues and\\xa0miracle healings.\\nThey have\\xa0been\\xa0scrutinized in the media\\xa0for using the title “handmaiden”\\xa0to describe their women leaders, and for exerting control over the personal lives of their members. Leaders of the group say they mostly function as a support network for their members and\\xa0deny having any influence over the decisions of members in positions of power, like Barrett.\\nIn her three years as a judge on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals,\\xa0Barrett has authored more than\\xa0100 opinions\\xa0on\\xa0cases that have come to her desk from across the Midwest.\\nIn a case from June 2020 she was the sole voice on a three-judge panel that supported allowing\\xa0federal enforcement of Trump’s public charge immigration law in Illinois, which prevents immigrants from getting legal residency in the United States if they rely on public benefits like food stamps or housing vouchers.\\nShe also called for the re-hearing of a case that struck down former Indiana Gov. Mike Pence\\'s 2016 abortion law, which prohibited abortions if the fetus was disabled.\\nContact IndyStar courts reporter Johnny Magdaleno at\\xa0jmagdaleno@gannett.com or 317-273-3188.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'This story was published in partnership with The 19th, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom reporting on gender, politics and policy.\\nLGBTQ voters are becoming an increasingly key constituency for presidential candidates. On Super Tuesday, 10% of voters identified as queer,\\xa0a marked jump from the 6% recorded in the\\xa02018\\xa0midterms. But it isn’t just queer voters that LGBTQ rights groups want to activate in November.\\xa0\\nAdvocates are targeting “equality voters,” or people who will likely back candidates that are supportive of LGBTQ rights and vote against candidates who aren’t. Those voters — 57 million people, according to the Human Rights Campaign — could make or break the presidential election, activists say.\\xa0\\n“It’s somebody who, front of mind, is considering not only how their vote will impact themselves or their own community, but also LGBTQ people, people of color, immigrants, women and other people who have been marginalized and under attack for the last three and a half years,” said Geoff Wetrosky, campaign director for the Human Rights Campaign.\\nRegister to Vote in 2020 Elections | USA TODAY\\nTo get a sense of how powerful this voting bloc is, consider this: White Evangelical voters made up\\xa026%\\xa0of the electorate in the 2018 midterms. Equality voters accounted for 29% of the electorate, according to Human Rights Campaign data. In swing states, the organization says it’s aiming to connect with 2.9 million suburban women, a constituency that polling shows is\\xa0turning on President Donald Trump.\\xa0\\nThe organization says equality voters trend young (30%\\xa0are younger than 35) and are often people of color (48%). Most significantly, 60% of them are women.\\xa0\\nThe Human Rights Campaign and progressive voter database company Catalist developed the equality voter model in 2016. For decades, LGBTQ field organizers had been phone banking and knocking on doors across the nation in support of policies like marriage equality, anti-discrimination protections and conversion therapy bans. That left the Human Rights Campaign with a substantial amount of voter intel.\\xa0\\n“We were at a point in time, really for the first time in history, where we could organize, not just self-identified LGBTQ people, but our allies as well,” said Wetrosky. “That’s important because LGBTQ people, by and large, vote in much higher numbers than the general public.”\\nCatalist combined decades of data stored from campaigns with public voter files and ranked voters on a score of 0-100, giving voters who backed candidates with pro-equality records higher scores. Those with a score of 70 and above were labeled equality voters. The label also includes LGBTQ people themselves — 11 million queer voters out of the 57 million total.\\nLucas Acosta, national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, describes equality voters as “me, but also my mom.”\\xa0\\nWestrosky said many equality voters will be people who have gay or transgender friends or family members. But in 2020, many are simply people who see LGBTQ rights as human rights.\\xa0\\nMarsha Sheppard of Madison, Wisconsin, said she votes for pro-equality candidates as a rebuke to the hypocrisy of her childhood church in Minnesota, which taught love and acceptance but shunned gay people. She’s voting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, in part, because they have much stronger records on LGBTQ rights than Trump, she said.\\xa0\\n“(Trump) said when he was a candidate he was for LGBTQ rights, and yet he’s trying to kick transgender people out of the armed services,” Sheppard said.\\xa0\\nLGBTQ rights:Georgia church is the first in the US to split from United Methodist Church on LGBT issues\\nLike Sheppard, Andy Lucich of Phoenix doesn’t vote for LGBTQ rights in support of family members or close friends.\\xa0\\n“I’m 36, obviously I live in a very diverse place in the center of Phoenix, and I see all types of different people,” Lucich said. “I just cannot get around the idea that you’re a bad person if you’re anti-LGBTQ.”\\xa0\\nLucich and Sheppard live in key states that the Human Rights Campaign plans to target through November. Of the 57 million equality voters identified by Catalist, 10.2 million live in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin.\\xa0\\nThe organization has sent 90 field organizers out to those seven states and another 70 to other states. Additionally, the group has identified 3.4 million voters who don’t consistently vote. Organizers will do everything they can to get those people to the polls, Wetrosky said.\\nThat strategy may have already proven effective. In 2014 midterm elections, 36% of equality voters turned out, the same as the general electorate. In 2018, 50% of the electorate voted, but equality voters jumped to 56%, a 6\\xa0percentage point increase over the general population.\\nAlthough LGBTQ voters may have had more at stake in the election than the general population, and thus more motivated to vote, Wetrosky hopes that some of that bump was because his organization hired organizers in swing states.\\n“Really one of the important parts of having staff on the ground is that we were able to, over the course of many years, build relationships with allied organizations, elected officials, and equality voters,” he said.\\xa0\\n'},\n",

Harris\\xa0\\'nasty,\\' \\'mad\\' and \\'mean.\\' \" That was followed by 7% of the coverage that used\\xa0citizenship or racial identity language, such as reporting on “birtherism” conspiracy theories and Harris’ ancestry. Six percent of coverage used language that oversexualized or underqualified the senator’s merits, the report found.\\nTchen warned that coverage focusing on coded language, like \"ambitious\" or \"phony,\" creates a negative image in the mind of voters.\\n“When they\\'re used against a woman of color running for high office, that could plug into our existing preconceived prejudices and stereotypes about women,” Tchen said. “When attached to a man, the word \\'ambitious\\' is actually a good quality. You’re seen as a leader and strong.

       "  'body': '\"David Byrne\\'s American Utopia\" is the salve we all need right now.\\xa0\\nThe vibrant concert movie, premiering Saturday on HBO and HBO Max (8 EDT/PDT), is directed by Spike Lee, capturing last year\\'s hit Broadway production of the same name. The 105-minute film features a mix of Talking Heads favorites and songs from Byrne\\'s 2018 \"American Utopia\" album, sprightly performed by Byrne and a group of suit-clad, barefooted dancers, most of whom also play handheld instruments.\\nThroughout the show, the former Talking Heads frontman\\xa0delivers disarmingly poignant interludes about the importance of connection, community, immigrants and voting – topics that take on new resonance with the looming presidential election. For Byrne, 68, his experience performing \"Utopia\"\\xa0was as life-affirming as it is to watch.\\xa0\\n\"People would ask, \\'Don\\'t you get bored doing the same show every night?\\' Not that one,\" Byrne says over Zoom.\\xa0\"Everybody feels really great doing the show, it\\'s hard to explain. The songs, the choreography,\\xa0everything we do generates that kind of feeling.\"\\nByrne first met Lee at the premiere of the filmmaker\\'s 1989 race drama \"Do the Right Thing,\" and\\xa0reconnected in 2016 when Byrne appeared in his documentary \"Michael Jackson\\'s Journey from Motown to Off the Wall.\" Lee attended\\xa0an out-of-town tryout of \"Utopia\" in Boston last year and was immediately taken with the show.\\xa0\\n\"It was right in his wheelhouse,\" Byrne says. Like the 1984 Talking Heads concert movie \"Stop Making Sense,\" directed by the late Jonathan Demme, \"Utopia\" is \"an ensemble film. It\\'s about how all these people work together or trade places or each have a moment in the spotlight. And that\\'s part of what Spike does, too.\"\\n\"Utopia\" features slightly reworked but still joyous versions of Talking Heads crowd-pleasers including \"This Must Be the Place,\" \"Burning Down the House\" and \"Road to Nowhere.\" But one of the most powerful moments is actually a cover of Janelle Monae\\'s \"Hell You Talmbout,\" an incendiary protest song in which Byrne and Co. chant the names of Black men and women lost to police violence. Lee intercuts the performance with shots of victims\\' families and adds more recent names such as Breonna Taylor and George Floyd.\\xa0\\n\"Spike said, \\'We\\'re going to bring family members into the theater,\\' \" Byrne says. \"The song itself is very emotional. And seeing those people whose sons and daughters had been murdered, I just thought, \\'What is going through their heads? What a loss these people have had, and how strange it must be to see a white guy of a certain age shouting out their child\\'s name.\\'\\xa0I was very moved by that experience. I thought it could very well have turned into, \\'Oh, this white guy\\'s\\xa0trying to cash in,\\' but it never seemed like it fell into that trap.\"\\xa0\\nByrne attended a number of bike protests for Black Lives Matter in New York this summer. (Bicycles are his preferred mode of transportation, and he frequently biked to the theater during \"Utopia\\'s\" nearly five-month run.)\\xa0 But the musician landed in hot water last month when a clip resurfaced of him online in blackface. The promotional video was shot for \"Stop Making Sense\" in 1984, as Byrne \"interviewed\" himself and portrayed a number of Black and brown journalists. He issued an apology on Twitter, calling it \"a major mistake in judgment that showed a lack of real understanding.\"\\xa0\\n\"In retrospect, you look at it and go, \\'What was I thinking? How could I have done that?\\' \" Byrne says. \"But rather than trying to have YouTube take it down or come up with some excuse, I thought, let me just be really transparent and go, \\'I did this. I\\'m ashamed of this.\\' We all do grow and evolve and change, and let\\'s hope that we can all\\xa0be understanding in that way.\"\\xa0\\nByrne says he hasn\\'t written any new music inspired by this tumultuous year. (\"I feel like I\\'m still processing everything that\\'s happening and trying to figure out how I respond to this.\") Nor did he tune in to the first presidential debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. (\"I kind of had an idea of what it might be,\" he says, instead watching \"I\\'m Thinking of Ending Things\" on Netflix.)\\n\"Utopia\" is scheduled to return to\\xa0Broadway next September, after theaters are allowed to reopen next summer. But in the meantime, he\\'s focusing on his Reasons to Be Cheerful project, which started as \"self-therapy\" and promotes positive news. And he\\'s tirelessly working to encourage people to vote, a right the Scotland native\\xa0got in 2012 when he became a U.S. citizen.\\xa0\\n\"Not just this year\\xa0– although this year seems particularly important\\xa0– but always,\" Byrne says. \"The actual voter turnout is kind of shameful. People died to have the right to do this. Black people, women, all kinds of people have worked so hard to get this. And now to cavalierly go, \\'I don\\'t feel like showing up\\' or \\'I\\'m busy that day?\\'\\xa0Your\\xa0duty is to participate in this country or don\\'t complain. Just shut the (expletive) up.

       "  'body': 'SACRAMENTO, Calif. — When he went to the annual Sacramento Archives Crawl in\\xa0October, Diego Leibman didn’t expect to discover the dark heart of local history. But in the serene halls of the California State Archives — surrounded by the dusty smell of paper, soft conversation, short-handled hoes and other artifacts out of time — Leibman was introduced to his hometown’s anti-Chinese past.\\nHe heard\\xa0the story of 10\\xa0Chinese miners who in September, 1877, were arrested on accusations of killing a white woman at a granite mining settlement in Rocklin, Calif., a former mining town 40\\xa0minutes east of Sacramento.\\nDespite a\\xa0lack of evidence, the men were detained, and a mob of angry Rocklin residents outside the jail threatened to lynch them before dawn. The next day, all 400 of Rocklin’s Chinese residents were notified they had until 6 p.m. to leave town, and by that afternoon every Chinese resident had filed out on foot.\\nBy 6 p.m., white residents axed and flattened\\xa0all the houses and buildings in the Chinese quarter, Rocklin historian Gary Day said. A fire was sparked and within minutes Chinatown was burned to the ground.\\n“I was shocked...” Leibman, who is 17, said. “No expression of white supremacy, violent or otherwise, will ever surprise me in U.S. history… The part that aggravated me is that it\\'s not taught.”\\nThe lesson sparked a wave of indignation in Leibman and a desire to unearth even more. He turned to Rocklin historians and Asian American history experts Franklin Odo, founder of the Smithsonian’s Asian Pacific American Center, and Ted Gong, executive director of the 1882 Foundation. Their research and expertise helped him understand where Rocklin fit into the larger picture of racism in America.\\nIt was through this research that Leibman uncovered another history: His high school, Whitney High, was named for a white landowner. According to Day and other Asian American historians, Joel Parker Whitney, known as “The Richest Man in Placer County,” likely built his legacy by exploiting Chinese laborers for ditch-digging, road paving and wall building.\\nLiebman became determined to push for his school district to mandate Chinese Californian history as part of the district’s curriculum and name a school building after a prominent Chinese American, such as Wong Kim Ark, who won the first birthright citizenship case in the U.S. Supreme Court.\\n“(Chinese expulsion) seems inextricably linked to Rocklin\\'s history and worth mentioning,” Leibman said. “If not for bigotry, we\\'d have a Chinatown … If nobody learns about this history, that affects how they understand the present.”\\nFor Leibman, this proposal is the first step in getting his town’s residents to learn about where they come from. But Rocklin’s anti-Chinese story is far from unique in California’s Central Valley.\\nRocklin’s expulsion of its Chinese residents in 1877 was one of nearly 200 violent anti-Chinese pogroms in\\xa0California from\\xa0the 1870s to the 1890s. It’s recent enough for contemporary Americans to be able to trace the effects of this expulsion today in demographic data and Chinese American migration patterns in California.\\n“We’re not generations removed from these histories,” said Jean Pfaelzer, a historian and author of “Driven Out,” a history of Chinese expulsions in California.\\nAs migration to California was propelled by the Gold Rush in 1848, many Chinese residents settled in Northern California and the Central Valley, where their labor was often exploited.\\nPerhaps the most infamous example\\xa0is construction of the Transcontinental Railroad between 1863 and 1869. About\\xa020,000 Chinese workers made up 90% of the railroad’s workforce.\\nIt was painful and brutal work, with Chinese workers being paid almost 50% less. They were forced to provide their own food and, in some cases, their own housing.\\nAfter railroad construction ended, Chinese people found work primarily in manual labor, including\\xa0fruit cultivation, ditch-digging and manufacturing as well as in laundries and restaurants.\\xa0\\nAnd while it’s important to acknowledge how Chinese laborers were marginalized and exploited, Cecilia Tsu, a historian at the University of California, Davis, said it’s even more important to recognize their rebellion.\\n“That part of the story needs to be told,\" Tsu said. \"They’re not just these powerless victims of the system.\"\\nPfaelzer cited the first lawsuit ever filed for reparations in the U.S., in the Northern California port city of Eureka, where 300 Chinese residents were kicked out one weekend in 1885. Instead of shuffling out obediently, 52 exiled Chinese residents\\xa0filed a lawsuit for $152,000, although the suit was ultimately unsuccessful.\\nAnd Tsu recalled the history of laborers leveraging landowners’ dependency on their work to get better contracts, though they still worked for lower wages than white workers.\\nShe pointed to the case of Wong Kim Ark, who in 1898 challenged the U.S. government’s refusal to recognize his citizenship despite his birthplace of San Francisco. He eventually won his case at the Supreme Court, paving the legal road to birthright citizenship.\\nTo change\\xa0the Rocklin school district\\'s\\xa0curriculum, the proposal first needs to be on the school board\\'s meeting agenda. After Leibman rallied 58 people to advocate for him during the Aug. 5 meeting, the board agreed to form a committee to review the\\xa0proposed changes and decide on whether to add them to the curriculum.\\nCalifornia\\xa0and American history have\\xa0historically scrubbed Chinese American contributions, such as in the famous photograph taken upon the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad, which doesn’t include a single one of the Chinese laborers whose backbreaking work was essential to connect the West Coast with the rest of the country.\\xa0\\nThe legacy of Asian American history, its struggle and resistance, is a powerful reminder that Asians have carved\\xa0out space in America for a long time.\\n“If you are interested in having an accurate view of the past, then you can’t ignore this history,” Tsu said. “Do we want a history that’s just about myth and celebrating American identity, or do we want to know the truth? Who really built this country? If we want to know the truth, then we have to include this … We need to include this history because this is our history.”\\nAshley Wong covers the Asian American and Pacific Islander community for The Sacramento Bee.

       "  'body': 'The lid is going to blow off the boiling pot at some point. \\xa0\\nMaybe the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg won’t be the triggering event.\\xa0But the fact of minority rule\\xa0—\\xa0and the fiction of one person, one vote\\xa0—\\xa0can’t last forever. \\xa0\\nConservatives already\\xa0have a Supreme Court majority, and now it looks like they could have one for generations. But\\xa0they lost the country long ago.\\xa0\\nAnd liberals helped give it away.\\xa0\\nWhere was the Democratic money, where was the Democratic president, where was MSNBC and “Merrick Garland Held Hostage, Night 237” when Mitch McConnell’s Senate refused to consider his nomination throughout the final 10 months of President Barack Obama’s term? Where were the Democratic strategists who could and would play hardball at\\xa0the same level as\\xa0McConnell?\\xa0\\nWhere were the senior Democratic women who might have persuaded Ginsburg to seal her legacy by stepping down while a Democrat was president? To not wait, not take this chance, not tempt fate? We know she understood the stakes.\\xa0\"My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed,\"\\xa0Ginsburg told her granddaughter in her final days, according to NPR.\\nMcConnell dashed that hope the same day she died.\\xa0“President Trump’s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate,”\\xa0he said, making a political argument about the will of the people that rests on the distortions of an outdated\\xa01787 Constitution\\xa0that allots the same number of senators — two —\\xa0to each state, from California (population 39.5 million) to Wyoming (population 580,000).\\xa0\\xa0\\nVoters in the right places in the right numbers may finally decide they don’t like what’s being done to them, enough for Democrats to win the presidency and control of the Senate. That’s what former Sen. Claire McCaskill,\\xa0D-Mo.,\\xa0said in a Twitter post urging that “everyone take a deep breath.” Forcing a vote on a Supreme Court nominee before the Nov. 3 election “guarantees” that McConnell and Republicans lose\\xa0the Senate, she said, and forcing it in a lame-duck session after the election “probably loses them more seats in 2022.”\\xa0\\nPerhaps.\\xa0McConnell’s statement about a vote, while vague on timing, suggests he\\'s willing to take those risks. And why not?\\xa0Beyond the 2018 midterms, what price have Republicans paid\\xa0for their endless double standards\\xa0and Trump-enabling? The House Democratic wave that year shows what could happen with true representative government. But presidents and senators aren’t chosen that way.\\xa0\\nI wish I were as optimistic as McCaskill and others\\xa0about Republicans having qualms and Democrats having\\xa0backbones. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham said in 2018 that he would “wait to the next election” in a situation like this. But this year he has said that\\xa0he’d take up a nomination if a vacancy occurred, including after\\xa0Donald\\xa0Trump tweeted Saturday that the Senate should vote on a Ginsburg successor \"without delay.\"\\xa0It’s hard for me to imagine four Republican senators sinking a Trump justice\\xa0by joining Democrats in voting against his nominee\\xa0on the Senate floor, or Democratic voters caring about the Supreme Court in a way they never have before,\\xa0even after the Garland outrage in 2016. \\xa0\\nPlay GOP-style hardball:Republicans are eating our lunch. I want a 2020 Democrat tough enough to eat theirs.\\nMassive fundraising since the announcement of Ginsburg\\'s death suggests it might be the wake-up call Democrats need\\xa0— yet it comes\\xa0too late. Trump, who received 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton and won the 2016 election anyway, may have\\xa0named a third of the Supreme Court by Election Day. And those justices don’t have to retire, as we were so tragically reminded Friday. They can stick around as long as they live.\\xa0Some, like Ginsburg, make the world a better place for women and many others. Others thwart the will of the people.\\nIt’s enough to make liberals like me want to add a couple of new states to the country, a few new justices to the court and an 18-year limit on Supreme Court service.\\nIf Democrats\\xa0win control of the White House and the Senate, there is a way to temper, though likely not neutralize,\\xa0the impact of a 6-3 conservative court. It would be for a Democratic Congress and president to enact constitutionally bullet-proof laws that preempt legislating from the bench.\\nThis must start with decisive victories on Nov. 3,\\xa0 not in two years or four years. It must continue with explicit, rapid-fire action to\\xa0protect everything and everyone in danger\\xa0— immigrants, refugees, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the Affordable Care Act, the rules on money (including foreign money) in politics,\\xa0all the anti-corruption laws we need to codify the norms Trump has shown are optional and therefore useless. It must entail getting rid of all obstacles, including the filibuster, to make these things happen in the first two years Democrats hold the levers of power, because they can’t count on more than that.\\xa0\\nWill\\xa0Democrats recognize the depth of the threat facing them and the country? Would\\xa0a President Joe Biden see his former colleagues across the aisle as they truly are? Would he realize, as Obama never seemed to, that this asymmetry is not healthy? That it’s destructive to the American political system to have one party that’s passive and rule abiding, and another that’s cold blooded, power hungry and fine with ghastly hypocrisy?\\nCose:We\\'re trapped in an obscene distortion of democracy. We don\\'t have to be.\\xa0\\nIn the end,\\xa0that lid will blow off. The majority won’t stand for a ruling political class that does nothing to reduce racism, gun violence, opportunity gaps and climate change, that doesn’t mind if people can’t get or afford health care, that stands by while an incompetent, corrupt president lets 200,000 people die and millions lose jobs and sink into poverty in a pandemic that other nations have managed to control.\\xa0\\nRepublicans can force themselves and their fetishes — tax breaks for the rich, deficit spending through the roof, thumbs\\xa0on the scale for corporations — on America, but it won’t last forever. The reckoning may be a long time coming. I may not be around for it. But\\xa0at some point\\xa0the boiling water will shoot up like a geyser, and the jury-rigged compromises that birthed this country will give way at last to modernity, to sanity, to a better way forward.\\xa0\\nJill Lawrence is the commentary editor of USA TODAY and author of\\xa0\"The Art of the Political Deal:\\xa0How Congress Beat the Odds and Broke Through Gridlock.\"\\xa0Follow her on Twitter:\\xa0@JillDLawrence\\n'},\n",

Wade “reflects public rejection” of the idea that legal precedent “can declare a permanent victor in a divisive constitutional struggle.”\\nA former member of the University of Notre Dame’s “Faculty for Life,” Barrett signed a\\xa02015 letter\\xa0to Catholic bishops that affirmed the “teachings of the Church as truth.” Among those teachings: the “value of human life from conception to natural death” and marriage-family values\\xa0“founded on the indissoluble commitment of a man and a woman.”\\nBarrett\\xa0wrote in 2017\\xa0that Chief Justice John Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning in order to save it.

       "  'body': 'At some point during the debates, perhaps more than once, Donald Trump will say yet again that he has accomplished more\\xa0in his first term than any prior president. Despite his penchant for lying, it is hard to deny that among all our presidents, his record does stand out — just not in the way he wants you to think it does.\\nTrump has presided over the worst U.S. public health catastrophe in more than a century.\\xa0His leadership failures during that crisis — from lying to suppressing data to promoting quack cures to endangering his own supporters in mass gatherings\\xa0without masks or social distancing — have led to nearly 205,000 COVID deaths. That\\'s many more per capita than other developed nations, in some cases more than double their toll.\\xa0\\xa0\\nTrump\\'s mishandling of the COVID pandemic\\xa0helped produce the biggest economic collapse since the Great Depression\\xa0—\\xa0including an unemployment rate of\\xa0 nearly 15% in April. Some estimates suggest that over 40 million Americans lost their jobs as a result of the crisis.\\xa0Only a fraction of those jobs have returned.\\xa0Some will never return.\\xa0\\nEconomists predict that the unemployment rate through the end of the year, even with recent improvement, could\\xa0average about\\xa010%, roughly the same as during the worst of the Great Recession\\xa0a decade ago.\\xa0In fact, as a recent advertisement for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has made clear, Trump has the worst job creation record of any president in our modern history.\\xa0\\nThe gross domestic product contraction of 31.7% in the second quarter of this year, on an annualized basis,\\xa0is by far the largest recorded\\xa0in U.S. history.\\xa0According to economists tracked by Bloomberg, the annualized growth rate under Trump’s first four years under a reasonable projection for the remainder of his term is likely to be 0.6%.\\xa0That’s the worst since Herbert Hoover,\\xa0about a quarter of the growth level under Barack Obama, and just about a\\xa0seventh the average growth rate during Bill Clinton’s eight years in office.\\xa0\\nAs a result of the crisis, today 1 in 5 mothers of children under 12 reported that their children were not getting enough to eat.\\nAmerica’s international standing has also been hammered under Trump.\\xa0Under Obama, 74%\\xa0in a Pew Research Center poll of\\xa032 countries had confidence in him to “do the right thing” in international affairs.\\xa0Only 29%\\xa0felt Trump would and that was in January, before the COVID-19 catastrophe.\\xa0Even Russian President Vladimir Putin ranked higher.\\nThis is the toll of Trump attacking our\\xa0allies, tearing up international agreements and undermining international institutions.\\xa0Then came the crisis. In a new Pew poll, the U.S.\\xa0image plunged around the world, in some countries to record lows.\\nOn environmental policy, nine major green organizations rated Trump the “worst president for our environment in history.” Last year, nearly two-thirds of\\xa0of Americans called\\xa0the president’s record on the environment \"poor” or “fair.”\\xa0A new study from the Rhodium Group says Trump regulatory gifts to polluters will put an additional 1.8 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 2035 — according to The New York Times\\xa0that\\'s “more than the combined energy emissions of Germany, Britain and Canada in one year.”\\xa0\\nSome of the areas in which Trump claims a great record are downright offensive — like his assertion that he has done more for Black people than “any president since Abraham\\xa0Lincoln.”\\xa0This is belied by his defense of white supremacist groups with his “very fine\\xa0people on both sides\" rhetoric,\\xa0his abuse of Latin immigrants at our border\\xa0and his constant use of racist dog whistles.\\xa0\\nHe is one of only two U.S. presidents to be impeached by the House during their first term\\xa0in office, one of only three ever to be impeached and the only president to have ever been impeached on national security grounds.\\xa0\\nPandemic:Mr. President, people with COVID-19 are somebody to me, not \\'nobody\\'\\nHe is the first ever to have been credibly accused of betraying his country to a foreign power.\\xa0In 2016, and again this year, he has sought the support of foreign enemies to win the election and has taken other active measures, like undermining the U.S. Postal Service, to gain an unfair advantage.\\xa0He is the only president to be accused of\\xa0serial sex abuse, tax fraud\\xa0and violation of emoluments clauses in the Constitution.\\xa0\\nHe denigrated our troops and refused to rise to their defense when credible reports suggested Russia had put a bounty on the heads of Americans serving in Afghanistan.\\xa0He even refused to guarantee a peaceful transfer of power should he lose the upcoming election.\\xa0\\nNo president has been associated with so many people\\xa0charged with criminal conduct, and\\xa0no administration has been\\xa0home to such sweeping corruption.\\xa0And that’s despite having a Justice Department that has sought to lift the president beyond the reach of the law and a record of packing the courts with unqualified and extremist judges.\\nThe result of all this is that historians and political scientists have concluded\\xa0there is a key metric by which Trump stands apart from all other presidents.\\xa0He is the worst.\\xa0\\nThe president repeatedly says he wants to run on his record. Of course, what he says about that record is not true.\\xa0(That’s another area he leads all presidents — by a mile.\\xa0According to fact-checkers at The Washington Post, by July he had\\xa0made more than 20,000 false or misleading claims.) But when you look at the truth of the damage Trump has done in his four years in office, if you care about America’s future, you can only hope that like Trump,\\xa0all Americans want to make the 2020\\xa0election a referendum on his record.\\n200,000 dead: COVID-19 is creating\\xa0economic damage that will take years to repair\\nLet it be a vote on failing to rise to the greatest challenge he faced, the pandemic, and a vote on economic performance and the staggering costs of bad policies.\\xa0Let it be a vote on corruption.\\xa0Let it be a vote on his attacks and those of his attorney general on the rule of law, a vote on sending armed federal forces\\xa0to intimidate peaceful protesters.\\xa0Let it be a vote on undermining our allies, supporting our enemies and pulling out of international agreements that made us safer.

       "  'body': 'WASHINGTON\\xa0– The Supreme Court tries\\xa0to stay out of politics, but it begins its 2020 term Monday as both a divisive issue in the presidential election and the potential arbiter of it.\\nShorthanded and still mourning the death last month of Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the eight remaining justices will carry on\\xa0their work amid a partisan firestorm over her likely successor.\\xa0\\nAt the same time, they will face a flurry of emergency petitions from Democrats and Republicans over the way mail-in ballots are distributed, delivered and counted in an election President Donald Trump claims – without proof\\xa0– has been\\xa0rigged against him.\\xa0\\nNot since 1991 has the court\\xa0faced an\\xa0ideological shift as dramatic\\xa0as the one federal appeals court Judge Amy Coney Barrettrepresents. Not since 2000 has it faced the prospect of interceding so deeply in a presidential election.\\xa0\\nAmy Coney Barrett:\\xa0Talented judge, popular professor brings solid conservative credentials\\nAnd the Senate confirmation fight, which will drown out the more mundane docket\\xa0of cases the justices will consider by phone because of the COVID-19 pandemic, comes with its own rancorous\\xa0history. Republicans are determined to confirm Trump\\'s nominee days before the election after blocking President Barack Obama\\'s similar effort in 2016.\\nMore:Trump and 2 senators\\' positive COVID-19 tests spark worries over Amy Coney Barrett confirmation, but GOP moving forward anyway\\nThe ideological, political and procedural firestorms will make it difficult for the court to do what Chief Justice John Roberts strives to do: call balls and strikes, and steer clear of politics.\\n“The last thing they want is for the court to be seen as even more partisan,\" says David Strauss, who heads the Supreme Court and appellate clinic at the University of Chicago Law School.\\xa0\"That’s the worst possible outcome.”\\nThe political controversies at\\xa0the high court\\'s doorstep threaten\\xa0its standing as the most trusted branch of government. The executive and legislative branches, battling over the pandemic, a\\xa0foundering economy, racial inequities, immigration and health care, fare much worse.\\nThe high court\\'s year began with Roberts presiding over the president\\'s\\xa0impeachment trial in the Senate and included landmark rulings denying Trump the immunity he sought to protect his tax returns and financial records from investigation. It could end with the justices\\xa0playing a crucial role in the presidential and congressional elections.\\nBut\\xa0when it comes to the federal judiciary, Trump\\xa0may have the last laugh. Having named two Supreme Court justices and more than 200 lower federal court judges in his first term already, he is on the verge of adding a third justice:\\xa0a deeply conservative, 48-year-old\\xa0judge and Notre Dame law\\xa0professor from Indiana who could reshape the court for decades to come.\\nMore:Six conservative justices? 10 ways the Supreme Court could change\\n“On the whole, we’re going to see a considerable and perhaps quite rapid shift to the right,\" said Orin Kerr, a University of California-Berkeley School of Law professor, during a recent\\xa0panel discussion sponsored by the conservative Federalist Society. With Barrett replacing Ginsburg, he said, \"That\\'s a very conservative court.\"\\nTo be sure, the high court has been conservative for decades. But the tilt has been somewhat tenuous, moderated by justices in the middle such as Sandra Day O\\'Connor, Anthony Kennedy and, most recently, Roberts himself.\\nGinsburg\\'s death occurred just in time for Republicans to change that. For much of the past year, her battle with cancer privately riveted liberals as well as conservatives,\\xa0her every medical relapse and recovery hitting the headlines.\\nFormer U.S. solicitor general Paul Clement has argued more than 100 Supreme Court cases, but he always will remember the most recent one, held by telephone while Ginsburg was in the hospital.\\n\"What an image that somebody was so dedicated to her craft and her role that she literally was asking questions from her hospital bed,\" Clement recalled at a Supreme Court conference sponsored by William & Mary Law School.\\nRemembering RBG:Justice Ginsburg returns to Supreme Court for final time\\nTrump wasted no time with procedural formalities. The White House contacted Barrett the day after Ginsburg\\'s death, and two days later the federal judge\\xa0and mother of seven was interviewed and offered the nomination.\\xa0\\nAll but two Senate Republicans quickly endorsed moving ahead with confirmation, all but assuring she wil\\xa0join the court in time for oral arguments in November. If so, one of her first cases will determine whether religious groups can be exempt from anti-discrimination laws, followed closely by a third major threat to the Affordable Care Act.\\nIn that case, Ginsburg\\'s death makes what had appeared to be the health care law\\'s likely survival a bit more precarious. Republicans who have tried for a decade to kill the law could have Barrett on their side. Democrats and their liberal interest group allies, meanwhile, are trying to use the threat to their advantage in the confirmation battle.\\nMore:Health care law faces another Supreme Court showdown, this time without Justice Ginsburg\\'s vote\\nFor her part, Barrett insists she\\xa0would not impose\\xa0her personal convictions on the law.\\xa0\\n\"The president has nominated me to serve on the United States Supreme Court, and that institution belongs to all of us,\" she said in a Rose Garden ceremony Sept. 26. \"If confirmed, I would not assume that role for the sake of those in my own circle, and certainly not for my own sake.\"\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat\\'s of little solace to abortion rights advocates who fear that Barrett, who is on record opposing abortion personally, would help the court uphold new state restrictions. Longer term, they fear the court could overrule its 1973 Roe v. Wade precedent legalizing abortion nationwide.\\nFact check:In early 1970s, RBG represented woman discharged from military because she wouldn\\'t get an abortion\\n“I’ve never been more afraid for the prospects ahead,\" says\\xa0Louise Melling, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union.\\nAbortion rights survived the recently concluded Supreme Court term intact, along with other liberal causes such as LGBTQ rights and \\xa0protecting undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children from deportation. In each case, Roberts joined the liberal wing.\\nThis term, a similar coalition\\xa0is considered likely to save most of the Affordable Care Act, even without Ginsburg. States governed by Republicans want the entire law struck down\\xa0because Congress in 2017 eliminated the tax used to enforce its mandate that most people purchase insurance. But Roberts and Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote separate opinions last term that allowed statutes to stand after severing problematic provisions.\\nIt\\'s far more likely that the court\\'s 2020 term will be known for the many voting rights cases headed its\\xa0way. The court has been involved in the election since April when it\\xa0ruled 5-4\\xa0along ideological lines that absentee voting in Wisconsin could not be extended past the primary election date.\\xa0\\nMore:Supreme Court is shorthanded but could play role in election\\nMore than 300 lawsuits have been filed, in nearly every state, thanks largely to\\xa0problems associated with COVID-19\\xa0and the expansion of\\xa0voting by mail.\\xa0Republicans, including Trump\\'s reelection campaign, want to limit mail-in voting while Democrats push for greater opportunities.\\xa0\\nAny day now, the justices are expected to decide if Pennsylvania can count mail-in ballots for three days after Election Day. A similar lawsuit in Wisconsin is headed toward the high court. Both states are crucial battlegrounds in Trump\\'s battle against former Democratic vice president Joe Biden.\\nBefore, during and after Election Day, \"It\\'s easy\\xa0to imagine the campaigns fighting over every absentee ballot,\" says Richard Pildes, a leading election law expert at New York University School of Law.\\nTrump has raised that prospect as a\\xa0reason for the Senate to confirm Barrett by Election Day. After privately offering her the nomination but before announcing it, Trump said, \"I think this will end up in the Supreme Court, and I think it\\'s very important we have nine justices.\"\\nThat has led some liberal interest groups to argue that if she is confirmed, Barrett should recuse herself from considering election-related cases. Judges and justices generally remove themselves from a case only for more personal reasons, such as family interests or financial investments.\\n“Trump has put Barrett in a very difficult position,\" says Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California-Irvine School of Law. \"Now her objectivity in any Trump v. Biden\\xa0case could reasonably be called into question.”\\nOnce the election and subsequent lawsuits are history, the justices will hope to sink back into relative obscurity. But that\\'s unlikely to happen.\\nWhether Trump and Senate Republicans succeed in creating a 6-3 majority on the court or not, Democrats and allied groups appear intent on considering retaliatory changes to the court\\'s structure.\\nMore:Liberal groups seek to make Supreme Court an issue in 2020 presidential race, and conservatives exult\\nIf they emerge from the election with Biden in the White House and majorities in both houses of Congress, Democrats could try something last attempted by President Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s: adding seats to the nation\\'s highest\\xa0bench. That would allow them to install liberal justices as a counterweight to the court\\'s conservative majority.\\nGinsburg\\'s death \"makes court-packing by the Democrats more likely than it\\'s ever been,\" Strauss says. And that could lead Republicans, if they later regain power, to fight court-packing with more packing.\\nUnder that scenario, \"the Supreme Court\\xa0starts to look ridiculous,\" Clement said at the William & Mary conference. \"They\\'ve got to\\xa0get a new bench.”\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'This story was published in partnership with The 19th, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom reporting on gender, politics and policy.\\nSarah McBride made it a point to vote in person during \\xa0Delaware\\'s primary earlier this month. This particular trip to the polls was special: The 30-year-old voted for herself.\\n“I’ve never voted for someone like me before,” McBride said.\\nMcBride\\xa0overwhelmingly won a two-person Democratic primary\\xa0for a state Senate seat. And the makeup of her district, with its large base of registered Democratic voters, all but assures that McBride will win the seat in November, making her the nation’s first openly transgender state senator.\\xa0\\nMcBride ran a campaign focused on issues like health care, infrastructure and schools.\\xa0But she recognizes the historic nature of her primary win.\\n“One thing that I do think about is that in Delaware or North Carolina, or in Texas or Montana, there will be a trans kid who wakes up on Wednesday and … sees that the sky’s the limit for them,” she said. “That their dreams and their identities are not mutually exclusive.”\\nMcBride is part of a surge of transgender candidates this election cycle. At least 16 trans candidates are running for statehouse seats in 2020, according to a tally by the LGBTQ Victory Fund, an organization that works to increase the number of openly LGBTQ+ candidates in office.\\nAnnise Parker, president and CEO of Victory Fund, called the number of candidates “eye-popping.”\\n“Every time we elect someone, it sets a new milestone,” she said. “It’s a big deal.”\\nJust a few years ago, there were no openly transgender people serving in statehouses. Althea Garrison, a Black woman, was elected to the Massachusetts statehouse as a Republican in 1992,\\xa0but was outed by the media against her will. In 2012, Stacie Laughton became the first openly trans person to be elected to a statehouse, but\\xa0the Democrat resigned her New Hampshire House seat before she was sworn into office.\\nDanica Roem won a delegate seat in 2017 in the Virginia General Assembly, becoming the first openly trans candidate to both be elected and seated to a state legislature. There are now four trans people serving in state legislatures:\\xa0Lisa Bunker and Gerri Cannon\\xa0won seats in 2018 to the New Hampshire House of Representatives, and\\xa0Brianna Titone\\xa0won a seat in the Colorado House of Representatives the same year.\\nSoon, those numbers might further increase. Some candidates may have a greater chance at success in November, depending on their respective districts. Ultimately, advocates hope to at least double the number of trans legislators in statehouses, from four to eight.\\xa0\\nTaylor Small, a 26-year-old in Vermont, advanced in her Democratic primary on Aug.\\xa011 for a state representative seat. If she wins in November, as she’s expected, she would become the first openly transgender state legislator in Vermont. Small, who is\\xa0one of three trans candidates who ran for the Vermont statehouse this year, credits Roem and other trans candidates (in Vermont in 2018, Christine Hallquist\\xa0became the first openly transgender candidate to win a major party’s nominee for governor) for paving the way.\\n“We have seen openly trans legislators make it into positions of power. So a reality that we have not seen for ourselves before is actually achievable,” Small said. “We have seen history already been made and so therefore, I think of it as a mirror: Reflecting that this is an opportunity that can be presented for trans folks, or folks just generally in the LGBTQ community, that hasn’t been there.”\\nTransgender candidates are also running for Congress, city council and other local \\xa0seats. A handful of candidates who identify openly as gender non-conforming, nonbinary or\\xa0two-spirit\\xa0are also seeking elected office. There are\\xa028 openly trans people serving at any level of government in the United States. The bulk serve in local government seats.\\nVictory Fund estimates there are 864 LGBTQ+ people in elected offices nationwide. The organization counted at least 540 LGBTQ+ people who will be on the ballot in November, the most ever (they tallied over 430 candidates in 2018).\\nVictory Fund is among the organizations that have stepped up training in recent years to support LGBTQ+ candidates. Parker said although the data is limited, transgender candidates win at a rate proportional to their presence on the ballot.\\n“If you’re a good candidate and you do a good job and you’re a right fit for your district, you have just as good a chance as anybody else of winning. And the trans candidates who are running absolutely know that. They see Danica, they see Brianna, they see Gerri and Lisa … they see themselves. And they know they can do it. It creates a virtuous cycle.”\\nThe election of President Donald Trump in 2016 has spurred trans people to consider elected office instead of just local community organizing and advocacy, according to\\xa0Helen Boyd Kramer, an author and instructor of gender studies at Lawrence University in Wisconsin. She said trans people understand the unnecessary politicization of bodies, choice, and medical care “in deep ways.”\\n“The threat at this point for trans people is pretty direct,” she said, adding: “I think a lot of trans people who find themselves otherwise able to are running in big and small offices all over the place. So having that representation right now seems especially important.”\\nSeveral trans candidates have expressed outrage at the administration’s\\xa0policies\\xa0toward the LGBTQ+ community. Small, in Vermont, said it’s important to recognize the rhetoric coming from the White House “that is constantly denigrating trans people.”\\n“There is this piece of, no, we are not all of these horrible things that you’re saying, but instead we are leaders,” she said. “We are change makers. We are here to uplift.”\\nTransgender rights:Supreme Court win propels lower court victories\\xa0\\nKramer also noted that though the increase in candidates can seem sudden, trans people have been\\xa0politically active for decades. The first trans delegation came to the Democratic National Convention\\xa0in the early 2000s. In 2016,\\xa0McBride became the first openly transgender person to speak at a major party’s national convention\\xa0when she spoke during the DNC.\\nThe jump in candidates is the culmination of what happens when a group of people fight for their civil rights: They seek elected office. And victories like Roem’s make clear what is possible.\\n“The specific attack on trans people has motivated people,” she said. “And I think that that’s common in a lot of communities, like when you’ve got people basically saying, ‘Hey, we’re gonna take away your rights,’ then people are motivated to actually get themselves into some kind of position where they can have some kind of change.”\\nMcBride said a lot of candidates have seen their rights and dignity undermined by the Trump administration.\\n“I think that the attacks … against LGBTQ people, against women, people of color, immigrants, Muslims, I think it has reinforced the need to have more diversity at the table, to have more voices at the table and to have all of our communities reflected and represented in our legislative bodies and in our government,” she said.\\nThe bulk of openly transgender candidates are Democrats, according to Victory Fund. For Jennifer Williams, that highlights the need for more Republican trans candidates. In 2019, Williams, a Republican,\\xa0mounted an unsuccessful bid for the New Jersey State Assembly, becoming the first openly transgender person to run for a legislative seat there.\\nBut Williams, who is considering another run in 2021, recognizes that there is a tension in being a transgender Republican with the Trump administration in office.\\nWilliams emphasized that she and other Republican trans people do not support those policy decisions —\\xa0and that’s all the more reason for them to run.\\n“We need to have more transgender people in this party to step forward and run,” she said. “Because that’s the only way the leaders of the party are going to listen to us.”\\nOut of the hundreds of LGBTQ+ candidates who are elected officials, only 28 are Republicans, according to Victory Fund. Elliot Imse, Victory Fund’s senior communications director, said the nonpartisan organization endorses candidates who support equality and are viable candidates. That often precludes the limited number of Republican LGBTQ+ candidates from securing a Victory Fund endorsement. Imse added that many of the Trump administration’s policies are homophobic and transphobic.\\n“The goal is certainly to ensure more LGBTQ people and more trans people run for the Republican Party, because I am a big believer in change from the inside,” he said. “But unfortunately the party’s really moved in the wrong direction over the last four years.”\\nWith the number of transgender candidates expected to increase in subsequent election cycles, many of the current candidates have talked about the balancing act of running for office while talking about their identity.\\nMadeline Eden, who won a Democratic primary in March for a seat in the Texas House of Representatives, has tried to focus her campaign on issues like election accessibility and rural broadband. If elected, Eden would become the first openly transgender legislator in the state. She said her identity is not something she’s running on.\\n\"There’s so many more reasons for running for office here in Texas right now than that. I think it’s important, I think we need equitable trans representation in our state legislature, especially here,” she said. “But, I think that’s not as important as things like health care, or broadband, or the pandemic response, or local control, or just the hundreds of other things that our state has screwed up over the past 20 years.”\\nMcBride has also tried to focus on issues. She has particularly prioritized accessible and affordable health care after helping her husband, Andrew, as he battled a terminal cancer diagnosis. He died in 2014. McBride thinks about one of their last conversations a lot.\\n“I can hear him saying, ‘I love you, and I’m proud of you,’ ” she said.\\nVictory Fund has endorsed a handful statehouse candidates this election, including McBride, Eden, Small and Stephanie Byers,\\xa0a transgender woman who won her Democratic primary on Aug.\\xa04. Because of the set-up of her district, Byers is on track to become the first out trans person ever elected to public office in Kansas.\\xa0\\nJessica Katzenmeyer\\xa0has also secured an endorsement from Victory Fund. She won her April 7 Democratic primary in Wisconsin and would be the first openly trans state legislator in her state. Katzenmeyer, a first-time candidate, is a ride-share driver who wakes up around 5 a.m. each day to get in a shift before focusing on her mostly virtual campaign. A long-time community organizer, she has tried to focus on health care issues following a medical emergency in 2019.\\nKatzenmeyer said that trans people, who have been continually marginalized, can provide another level of empathy in the statehouse.\\n“Representation, it truly matters,” she said. “We need to have a more diverse legislature.”\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'WASHINGTON\\xa0— Like thousands of other teenagers,\\xa0Abhinand Keshamouni\\'s introduction to working the polls came from watching \"The Daily Show.\"\\nHost Trevor Noah ends each episode with a pitch for\\xa0Power the Polls, a\\xa0national recruitment network working to ensure there are enough poll workers on Election Day. The message resonated with Keshamouni, a 17-year-old senior from Canton, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit.\\nHe signed up first for the Michigan state primary in August. And he will be back at a polling site\\xa0Nov. 3, when he will take off a day from his high school that\\'s conducting classes online. Keshamouni\\xa0will\\xa0be\\xa0among more 1 million poll workers braving a pandemic to ensure people can vote – and he got four of his buddies to do the same.\\n\"I thought it was a really good way to help our democracy, especially because I can\\'t vote right now,\" Keshamouni said, adding that he also\\xa0got a\\xa0little pressure\\xa0from his parents,\\xa0Indian immigrants who will be voting in their first presidential election.\\xa0\"My entire family can\\xa0vote except for me, so they were like, \\'Go work the polls!\\' \"\\nFacing a drastic shortage of\\xa0poll workers in November because of the coronavirus pandemic, an army of\\xa0voting rights groups and other organizations this summer waged the most robust poll-worker recruitment campaign in modern election history. It has included high-profile allies, from Noah to NBA star LeBron James, whose recently formed More Than a Vote organization has worked to increase poll workers in predominantly Black districts. Companies like\\xa0Old Navy, Warby Parker\\xa0and Target are paying their employees who take a day off to work the polls.\\nAre you registered to vote?:Check your status or register online now\\nSenior citizens historically make up the bulk of the workforce at polling sites but thousands\\xa0opted out this year because they\\'re the most vulnerable to coronavirus. For months,\\xa0voting rights advocates feared\\xa0cities\\xa0might not have the manpower to keep all in-person polling sites open\\xa0– particularly in\\xa0battleground states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan that could decide the presidential election.\\nBut now election officials in cities such as Milwaukee, Detroit, Philadelphia,\\xa0Atlanta and Houston\\xa0aren\\'t just confident they will be able to keep an expanded number of polling sites open. Fueled in part\\xa0by a willingness of people in their 20s and 30s to step up, some cities said they have thousands more applications than they need.\\xa0\\n\"We have way more than we can even use right now,\" said Richard Barron, Fulton County\\xa0director of registration and\\xa0elections in Atlanta, which has added\\xa091 new polling locations since the state\\'s June primary. Fulton County has nearly 7,000 applications for 2,900 poll-worker positions. \"We\\'re in very good shape. A lot of people saw what happened in June and they decided they needed to get involved.\"\\nBarron said that includes many poll workers in their late teens and early 20s, pointing to\\xa0one\\xa0early voting site during the state\\'s\\xa0August\\'s primary runoff that was staffed\\xa0by six people under 25 years old.\\xa0\\n\"We\\'ve never had that before,\" he said.\\nIn some states, poll workers can be as young as 16 years old.\\xa0Election officials hope the young recruits return for future elections, making it their new civic tradition and creating a “new generation of poll workers.”\\nPrompting\\xa0much of the activism:\\xa0the scenes of\\xa0hours-long lines of voters during state primaries early on in the pandemic. Among the longest lines\\xa0were\\xa0in Milwaukee, where only five of 180 polling locations opened for Wisconsin’s April primary, and Atlanta, where voters – some who did not receive absentee ballots in the mail\\xa0– packed the limited number of polling sites open during its June primary.\\n\"We were really the poster-child across the country\\xa0for what it looks like not to have enough poll workers,\" said\\xa0Claire Woodall-Vogg, executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission. \"The\\xa0only good thing to come out of that is that our voters really had a visual of what a poll-worker shortage looks like. Ever since April 7, we\\'ve had hundreds and hundreds of people applying to be an election worker.\"\\nAlthough an unprecedented number of Americans are expected to vote by mail in November, voting rights advocates have pushed for all in-person voting sites to remain open to avoid voter suppression, particularly in communities of color that are often the most likely to see polling locations closed and consolidated.\\xa0\\nTo recruit\\xa0younger poll workers, Milwaukee partnered with the local Service Employees International Union, which represents restaurant workers and others in the service industry who tend to be young.\\xa0\\nThe Metro Atlanta Chamber launched an initiative to recruit\\xa0\"young, tech-savvy Georgians\" in the region while the state of Georgia teamed with the ACLU. Drawing more attention, Atlanta\\'s State Farm Arena, home to the NBA\\'s Atlanta Hawks and the WNBA\\'s Atlanta Dream, is one of several arenas and NFL stadiums nationally that will be used as voting sites.\\nIn Houston, the Harris County Clerk\\'s Office has a young clerks program in which more than 4,500 high school students in the Houston area will work polls in November. Texas law allows two excused absences a year for election work. The students are among the 25,000 poll-worker applications received this year in Houston\\xa0– far more than is needed to fill a record 11,000 positions. The city anticipates having 808 voting sites this year,\\xa0around 60 more than 2016.\\n\"There\\'s still more work to do, but we are in really good shape,\" Harris County Clerk Chris Hollins said.\\xa0\"We\\'re\\xa0going to have more election workers than ever before\\xa0– as many as 11,000\\xa0– but so far there\\'s been an outpouring of enthusiasm of folks wanting to be election workers.\\xa0Certainly, there are many more young people and middle-aged folks who have applied than ever before.\"\\nHollins said fewer senior poll workers backed out in Houston\\xa0than expected, which combined with the thousands of more applicants, led to the\\xa0large surplus.\\nElection officials are optimistic in\\xa0Detroit, where widespread problems from the state\\'s August primary led\\xa0Michigan Secretary of State\\xa0Joceyln Benson, a Democrat, to help oversee the November\\xa0election.\\xa0Her office\\xa0recruited 20,000 poll workers for the state, and with efforts ongoing, they believe there will be plenty\\xa0to cover Detroit\\'s\\xa06,000 election workers – one-third of whom are needed to count absentee ballots.\\n“It’s looking very, very promising,\" Detroit City Clerk Janice Winfrey said.\\nIn Philadelphia, another city that will closely watched in the race between President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, election officials said they\\'ve filled 5,660\\xa0of the city\\'s 8,515 poll worker positions\\xa0– far ahead of the typical pace after receiving\\xa0\"thousands\" of applications. The response has been so great they\\'ve been unable to contact everyone who has inquired.\\xa0\\n\"Our poll-working endeavors have been largely focused on the millennials, trying to get them involved in the democratic process,\" said Nakea Hurdle, chief deputy for Philadelphia City Commissioner Omar Sabir, who is overseeing the recruitment\\xa0efforts. \"We\\'ve seen an overwhelmingly large response.\"\\nPart of attracting more poll workers in some cities during a pandemic\\xa0is increasing pay. Houston is paying poll workers, including the 4,500 high school students, $17 an hour. Milwaukee, thanks to a grant from the\\xa0Center for Tech and Civic Life, added an additional $100 daily stipend on top of its normal $130 daily pay. Fulton County, Georgia has $150 in \"hazard pay\" on top of flat rates that range between $175 and $275 based on responsibilities.\\xa0 Philadelphia pays at least\\xa0$200.\\xa0\\nThe Center for Tech and Civic Life received a $250 million donation from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg to provide grants to cities to support the staffing and training of poll workers.\\nThe flood of applicants doesn\\'t mean the work is done\\xa0– recruitment efforts will continue up to the election\\xa0–\\xa0nor does it mean that Election Day will take place without problems,\\xa0long lines or fewer in-person polling sites.\\nSome cities and states have\\xa0already cut voting sites.\\xa0Maryland, for example, will have 80% fewer polling locations\\xa0in November, opting to instead adopt a limited number of \"voting centers,\" because of a sharp a decrease\\xa0in people willing to be poll workers.\\nMore:Maryland plans to open fewer polling places. What does that mean for rural voters?\\nComplicating the outlook, some cities have prepared for a higher-than-usual\\xa020% drop-off rate when it comes to showing up for work assignments because of the pandemic.\\xa0\\nAn analysis from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Democracy Works in August found more than 1.1\\xa0million poll workers are needed for the Nov. 3 election. Typically, more than half are over the age of 60 years old. Researchers projected a shortage of more than 465,000 poll workers. Although\\xa0that figure has been cut dramatically, a gap\\xa0still\\xa0remains.\\nPower the Polls, which formed in June\\xa0to help recruit low-risk and diverse poll workers,\\xa0surpassed its goal of signing up 250,000 people and is now nearing 500,000. But not all\\xa0applicants will find available positions, making it complicated to say how many poll workers are still needed nationally.\\nMore than 100,000 people alone signed up during the first three days of September, coinciding with National Poll Worker Recruitment Day. The nonprofit connects the applicants with\\xa0local jurisdictions.\\xa0The goal is to create a \"bench” of prospective poll workers who can fill in as needs arise and avoid any voting sites shutting down.\\n\"We\\'re really trying to emphasize young folks as sort of the next generation of poll workers,\" said Scott Duncombe, co-director of Power the Polls.\\xa0\"Not only are they less at risk for the disease, they\\'re a little more tech-savvy. A lot of times, we\\'ve seen election technology causing lines and issues. Additionally, young folks tend to be a little more representative.\"\\nHe called the threat of a shortage a real \"crisis\"\\xa0– but “not\\xa0one that we can’t solve together.”\\nPower the Poll’s partners include Alpha Phi Alpha, the country\\'s oldest historically African American fraternity that has recruited members to work polls. The group has also tapped into the Million Mask Challenge to help provide\\xa0protective equipment at polling sites.\\n\"It\\'s certainly been a huge challenge. We\\'ve never had to vote in a pandemic,” Duncombe said. “What really makes me hopeful is that it seems that a lot of folks really are stepping up. It seems like people are recognizing in many ways the need to serve. Young folks in particularly are stepping up and recognizing that you gotta do something.\"\\nNathaniel Persily, a law professor from Stanford University, helped launch the Healthy Elections Project with MIT in April to help local election officials ensure a smooth election during the pandemic. The project is working with two groups, Campus Compact and the Students Learn Students Vote Coalition, to recruit college undergraduate and graduate students to work polls.\\n“While at the beginning of the summer, I was concerned about their ability to recruit poll workers, I think they’re in much better position now than they were then,” he said, referring to cities like Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Detroit. He said the “baptism by fire” from the primary elections sounded the alarm early enough.\\nBut before the election, the Healthy Elections Project is urging states to adopt an online poll-worker dashboard like Ohio has that shows needs on a county-by-county basis. Persily said one of the problems with national efforts to recruit poll workers is not knowing where exactly help is needed.\\n“Naturally the poll-worker recruitment efforts are focusing on the battleground states and the biggest cities within them, but we don’t really know who’s doing well and who’s not.\"\\nDespite the strong recruitment, voting-rights advocates said\\xa0they are continuing to monitor communities with large Black and Latino populations, which have historically experienced a disproportionate share of poll closures. A 2019 report from the Leadership Conference Education Fund found 868 polling place closures from 2012 and 2018 in areas previously identified as Section 5 jurisdictions under the Voting Rights Act.\\nDig deeper on race and identity:Subscribe to This Is America, USA TODAY\\'s newsletter\\n“The closing of polling places has been a problem long before COVID,” said Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, “and now COVID and the impact on poll workers have made that an even dire situation.\\n\"What\\'s interesting right now is that there\\'s so much energy right now to engage and show up for our democracy at a time when it is getting battered by the president and the administration,” she said.\\xa0“I think there are a lot of folks who want to be ‘democracy workers.’”\\nMegan Lewis, co-founder and executive director of the\\xa0Voting Rights Lab, which is working to ensure voter accessibility, noted that African Americans vote by mail at lower rates than other voters. She said that makes it more important to ensure in-person polling sites remain open in\\xa0neighborhoods with large Black populations.\\xa0\\n“We\\'ve seen in study after study, even in prior elections, that if you close polling places you will have a disproportionate impact on voters of color,” Lewis said.\\n\"Vigilance is key,” she said, but added she’s optimistic “the combination of efforts” will allow the November election to run smoother than the primaries.\\nThat optimism is thanks to people like Valerie Ogamba, a 31-year-old sales worker, avid volunteer and budding law school student from Dublin, California, in the Bay Area.\\nAs Ogamba was checking on the status of mail-voting for herself, she saw an online link to volunteer as a poll worker. She signed up to work four days of early voting in Alameda County. It will be the first time she’s worked as a poll worker.\\n“As an African American woman, I just really wanted to put an emphasis on my volunteering and making sure I was all hands-on deck,” Ogamba said. “I’m really thrilled. With how important this election, I just can’t wait to be at the voting polls.”\\nDetroit Free Press staff writer Dave Boucher contributed to this report.

       "  'body': 'When COVID-19 came to New Orleans, Nicole Alston felt the impact immediately.\\nAlston, 45, is a home care worker who helped clients – often older people or those with disabilities\\xa0– eat, bathe and get dressed.\\xa0\\nAs her family’s breadwinner, Alston earns $8.50 per hour. The money’s barely enough. She and her husband are both diabetic. Her 19-year-old daughter, also diabetic, and 16-year-old nephew live at home with her. On weekdays, she takes care of three of her grandchildren.\\nBefore the pandemic, Alston, who works through a home care company, saw five clients regularly and worked 40 hours a week. Now, the only client she cares for is her husband, who is vision-impaired. He has coverage through Medicaid, so the company she works for charges his plan,\\xa0then pays her.\\xa0\\nHer employer\\xa0asked her to take on another client. Though she could use the money, she declined. Because of her family’s medical history – one of her grandchildren also has a heart condition – Alston is terrified of contracting the virus.\\xa0\\n“I don’t feel safe going into somebody’s house. We’re so sick already, so I don’t feel good about it at all,” Alston said.\\nAlston pockets wages for 10 hours of work each week. That’s $85 per week, or $340 per month.\\xa0\\n“What do you do? You’ve got to risk your life working\\xa0or risk your life not working and having the lack of your basic needs, which is food, water, what have you,” she said. “It’s basically damned if you do, damned if you don’t.”\\nCOVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on home care workers. It’s a\\xa0workforce that is 87% women,\\xa0and a majority are Black or Latina. About\\xa0a quarter\\xa0are immigrants. Some work for small companies, and some work on the less regulated “gray market,” where employers pay them directly out of pocket\\xa0and don’t necessarily require the same level of licensing. Even before the pandemic, home care workers received fewer protections and had higher rates of poverty, even though experts predict the need for home care workers will skyrocket in the coming decade.\\xa0\\nThe rapidly aging population –\\xa0by 2030,\\xa0the U.S. Census projects, older Americans will outnumber kids for the first time – has made home care one of the nation’s fastest-growing employment sectors, with about 4.5 million jobs.\\xa0On average, workers earn about\\xa0$12 an hour\\xa0and are more likely to rely on public assistance programs to make ends meet. Researchers say those inequities stem back to the\\xa0Jim Crow\\xa0era, citing interwoven, entrenched sexism and racism that have kept wages lower and exempted workers from many protections such as guaranteed overtime pay.\\nDuring the pandemic, home care providers are required to do “essential” work with little support or protection. Either they\\xa0provide care to vulnerable patients, often with limited personal protective equipment, or they forgo work and income in an effort to avoid the virus.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“It’s a story of a vulnerable workforce caring for a vulnerable population, and what happens in COVID,” said Dr. Madeline Sterling, an assistant professor at Weill Cornell Medical College, and one of the few researchers to study how COVID-19 has affected home care workers. “There needs to be policy changes that better serve them.”\\nThere’s no official data tracking how often home care workers have been diagnosed with the virus or how many have lost work because of COVID-19. The little\\xa0qualitative research\\xa0that exists suggests a high risk of infection and little institutional support or protection for vulnerable workers.\\xa0\\nBetween the economic strain and risk of infection, home care workers could also face a mental health burden. Women are at greater risk of anxiety and depression, a trend exacerbated\\xa0by the pandemic, hitting Black and Latina women especially hard. There’s also no data tracking incidence of either psychological condition among home care workers.\\n“There’s a crisis going on in home care. We just don’t see it,” said Kezia Scales, director of policy research at PHI, a New York-based advocacy group that studies home care workers.\\xa0\\nThe home care workforce hasn’t emerged as a major talking point for either presidential campaign, though former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, outlined a strategy for enhancing home care\\xa0worker protections.\\xa0 This includes higher pay and paid sick leave, as well as endorsing the\\xa0“Domestic Worker Bill of Rights,” legislation put forth by his running mate, California Sen.\\xa0Kamala Harris, which would guarantee overtime pay and protection from workplace harassment. President Donald Trump – whose administration has\\xa0sparred\\xa0with home care workers’ unions – has been silent on the issue, and the Department of Health and Human Services didn’t respond to inquiries about whether it plans any policies or initiatives to address home care workers’ needs.\\xa0\\nFor workers, the crisis is emerging in two forms. There are women such as Alston, who are afraid to work because of the risk of exposure and don’t have substantial savings to fall back on.\\xa0\\nOthers work because they must. They need the money, or their clients – who, because of American aging demographics, are more often women\\xa0–\\xa0are medically compromised. If they don’t take care of them, it’s unclear who will.\\xa0\\xa0\\nPolicies and benefits to protect home care workers “would by association help older women,” said Melinda Abrams, a senior vice president at the New York-based Commonwealth Fund, a health care foundation and research organization. Many don’t have family nearby to care for them, or they require full-time care that relatives aren’t able to give.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“I realized, if I didn’t do it, nobody was going to be there to help them day to day. They depend on us,” said Adara Benjamin, 26, a home care worker in Chicago who cares for three clients. “If I wasn’t here, who would cook? How is she going to\\xa0eat?”\\xa0\\nLow-income and younger workers bear brunt of coronavirus-related layoffs, study finds\\nEven before COVID-19 hit, home care workers had limited on-the-job protections. Paid sick leave isn’t guaranteed, and health care employers – a category that includes home care companies –\\xa0were exempted\\xa0from the federal Families First Act’s mandate to provide employees with paid time off if they fell ill. About a quarter of home care workers don’t\\xa0have health insurance,\\xa0according to data from 2016, the most recent year for which figures are available. More than a third rely on Medicaid or Medicare for their coverage.\\nHome care workers fall lower on the federal priority list for high-end PPE, such as the N95 masks that lower the risk of contracting COVID-19. Some receive gloves and masks from their employers\\xa0or from the state or county, but there’s no uniform policy or standard. Among those who get PPE, many say it’s nowhere near enough.\\xa0Employers, who have thin profit margins, aren’t reimbursed for PPE they purchase for employees.\\xa0\\nThe Daily Money\\nBenjamin makes about $14 an hour, and most of that, she said, goes toward buying protective gear. It’s expensive, but she said she has no choice. Her employers give her only one mask per client every two weeks\\xa0and a pair of gloves every two weeks, she said. Sometimes, she needs multiple pairs of gloves in one day.\\xa0\\nBenjamin lives with her 49-year-old mother, who works from home and has diabetes and high cholesterol.\\xa0\\n“I’m beyond terrified. Petrified. I have no idea – what would I do if at any point in time I contract it?” she said.\\xa0\\nBenjamin is better off than many of her peers:\\xa0She has health insurance through her union. Workers who are nonunionized,\\xa0or who work though the less regulated home care “gray market,” often don’t even have that.\\xa0\\nLydia Nakiberu, 41, a worker in Massachusetts, is undocumented. She works in home care, though the pandemic means her work has dipped – from 40 hours a week to 12. Her husband, applying for asylum,\\xa0works in a nursing home. Some of her clients pay her minimum wage, which is $12 per hour in Massachusetts; others pay less.\\xa0Neither Nakiberu nor her husband has health insurance.\\xa0\\nWhen he contracted COVID-19 this year, she cared for him with “home remedies” such as Vitamin C and hot water, she said. She knows doing what little work she has – she takes the bus to care for one client on weekends – exposes her, too. She puts whatever money she can toward buying extra protective gear.\\xa0\\n“I can’t afford getting sick, because I don’t have health insurance,” Nakiberu said. “I can afford the masks more than I can afford going to the hospital.”\\nBeyond protective gear, health insurance and sick leave, other inequities further heighten the risk for home care workers, Sterling said. In general, they are much more likely to rely on public transportation, which increases the risk of infection. The pandemic means older clients are more likely to need to stay home. Workers run errands that take them out of the house and into crowded, indoor spaces – pharmacies and grocery stores, for instance – adding another layer of risk.\\xa0\\nMany home care workers don’t get formal training on COVID-19, meaning they’re on their own in deciphering what risk they face and how to navigate it.\\nAll of those problems remain unaddressed, Sterling said,\\xa0and if the pandemic worsens this fall, as expected, they’ll take on heightened significance – even if the absence of federal or state data makes it impossible to track how bad things get.\\n“These are folks who provide personal care, medical care, emotional support,” Sterling said. “Despite being integral, they are often left out of the conversation. A lot of what they do is unrecognized.”\\nThis story was published in partnership with The 19th, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom reporting on gender, politics and policy.\\xa0\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'MIAMI, Fla. – Annette Collazo, a Florida Democrat who is\\xa0running for a seat in the state legislature, was campaigning at a constituent’s home when she heard a\\xa0TV ad that caught her attention.\\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\\xa0and other Democrats\\xa0were shown side-by-side with Latin American leaders such as former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. The ad\\xa0was paid for by President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign and played on Spanish-language television.\\xa0\\n“It is a concern because it\\'s such a very offensive accusation,” said Collazo, who is Cuban American. “It\\'s preying on people\\'s vulnerabilities, their sensitivities, their family trauma of having to leave everything in their home country to come here.\"\\nMore:\\'Anxious, fearful, angry.\\' At 50 days out to Election Day, many voters are wary of both Trump and Biden\\n“I think it’s deceptive,” Collazo said of comparing Democrats to communist dictators.\\nThe ad is one of many that have dominated TV and radio in the state, and its message appears to be resonating with an influential group of Latino voters in Florida: Cuban Americans.\\nBiden is underperforming with Cuban Americans in Miami-Dade,\\xa0the largest county in the state, as well as with Latino voters\\xa0across Florida,\\xa0according to recent polling.\\xa0The lack of support from Latino voters could cost Biden a win in Florida, which has backed the national winner in every election except one since 1964.\\nTrump narrowly won the state four years ago by a little more than 1%, a margin of fewer than 113,000 votes out of more than 9.5 million cast.\\nWeeks of anxious prodding from Florida Democrats that Biden has taken\\xa0the state for granted could finally be paying off.\\nOn Tuesday, Biden will make\\xa0his first visit to the Sunshine State since he secured the Democratic nomination. The former vice president also is doing more to take on the round-the-clock attacks that he\\'s a socialist, a potent message when delivered to Latinos who fled repressive regimes. And key allies, notably former New York City Mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg, are pledging to expand their efforts to help Biden win the state.\\xa0\\nWith early voting just weeks away, the question now: Is it too little too late?\\nBiden\\'s visit\\xa0Tuesday comes a few days after his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, campaigned in Miami, meeting with Black leaders at\\xa0Florida Memorial University, a historically Black college. She also stopped for arepas at Amaize, a Venezuelan restaurant in Doral\\xa0– also known as\\xa0\"Doralzuela\" to locals due to the large Venezuelan population.\\nThe president and Biden are virtually tied in the Sunshine State, according to an NBC News/Marist poll, after several\\xa0polls over the summer had showed the former vice president with a lead over Trump.\\nThe poll also shows Biden trailing Trump\\xa0among Latino voters in the state, 46%-50%, a group Hillary Clinton won by nearly 30 points\\xa0four years ago.\\nHispanic people in Florida make up about a quarter of the state\\'s roughly 21.5 million population and 17% of its registered voters. As the single biggest Hispanic ethnicity in the nation\\'s biggest swing state, Cuban Americans in South Florida wield big influence on the political stage.\\xa0They have generally leaned Republican, but younger generations are more liberal.\\nMore:\\'Outrageous\\': Sen. Kamala Harris, Democratic nominee for vice president, tells Black leaders in Florida Trump must be removed\\nA poll of Miami-Dade County voters by Bendixen & Amandi International and the Miami Herald, also showed Trump with a slight lead over Biden among all Latino voters. But the survey also found that among Cuban American voters, Trump led Biden by a whopping 38 percentage points.\\xa0\\nMiami-Dade alone represents about 10% of the state’s votes. In 2016, Clinton won the county over Trump by more than 290,000 votes; President Barack Obama won the county\\xa0by about 200,000 in 2012. While Clinton in 2016 also beat Trump statewide among Latino voters, 62% to 35%, she trailed him in support among Cuban American voters, 41% to 54%.\\nBiden doesn\\'t\\xa0need Florida to win the presidency, but\\xa0capturing the Sunshine State would likely portend an overwhelming victory nationally and be an embarrassing setback for the president who made the state his primary residence after complaining\\xa0about being treated \"very badly\" by political leaders in New York. No Republican since Calvin Coolidge in 1924 has captured the White House without winning Florida.\\nBiden has cut into Trump\\'s support with older votersin Florida and nationally\\xa0but some of his strength with that demographic has been offset by his weakness with Latino voters, including Cuban Americans.\\nBiden could get a boost from outside his campaign. A top aide to former presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg\\xa0confirmed media reports that the former New York City mayor plans to spend at least $100 million to help Biden in Florida.\\nNuestro\\xa0PAC, a group focused on Latino voter outreach created by former Bernie Sanders advisor,\\xa0Chuck Rocha, also is investing millions into bilingual mail outreach to newly registered Latino voters in Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\\nSome Democrats also want to see Biden\\xa0hit back more strongly\\xa0against Trump\\'s characterization of the party\\xa0as \"radical socialists.\" The message has\\xa0struck a nerve with many\\xa0Latinos who are Cubans, Venezuelans\\xa0and Nicaraguans, some of whom have fled communist regimes or have family members who did.\\nAl Cardenas, a Cuban American activist who once chaired Florida\\'s Republican Party, said the Trump campaign has successfully wooed South Florida Latinos largely because the president\\'s frequent broadsides against the Castro regime in Cuba and the Maduro regime in Venezuela have gone\\xa0unanswered.\\n\"Democrats have gone silent on the subject, so he filled up that silence to satisfy significant portion of the exile communities,\" said Cardenas, who opposes\\xa0Trump\\'s reelection but has not endorsed Biden.\\nLatino activists in the state have been pressing the Biden campaign to do more outreach with Hispanic voters.\\nIn July, a seven-page letter\\xa0from Florida Democratic Party field organizers accused the Biden campaign of lacking a “fully actionable field plan” as moves into working with the Florida party on voter outreach, according to the Miami Herald. Last month,\\xa0Voto Latino CEO Maria Teresa Kumar said the Biden campaign nationally has not done enough outreach to the Latino community.\\nSusan MacManus, political science professor emeritus at South Florida University, said the letter “was no surprise to us because it happens every four years.\"\\nMore:Trump campaign courts Latino voters in Arizona, historically Democrats. Here\\'s what that looks like\\n\"People from outside of Florida think the Latino vote in Florida is cohesive and it’s very diverse,” MacManus said.\\nDario Moreno, a political professor at Florida International University who specializes in Cuba politics, said Democrats sensed momentum in Miami-Dade after they flipped two congressional seats there\\xa0from Republican to Democrat in 2018 with the\\xa0victories of\\xa0Rep. Donna Shalala and Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell.\\n“After 2018, when (Democrats)\\xa0won the two congressional seats, they really took the Latinos for granted and haven’t really worked that community as much as they should have,” Moreno said.\\nThe Trump campaign has invested heavily in Miami-Dade County. Politico reported last week that the campaign has outspent the Biden campaign by nearly $4 million in TV ads for the Miami-Fort Lauderdale media market, with much of that spent on Spanish-language ads.\\nWhile the Trump campaign has an extensive strategy of\\xa0door-to-door campaigning, Democrats are relying far more on social media. Obama’s Cuba policy, which many older Cubans objected to, remains a millstone for Biden, some analysts said.\\nGet ready:Register to vote or check your status here\\nMoreno said the Biden campaign needs to invest more resources into courting\\xa0Latino voters in Florida, especially given the anger among many Cuban Americans at Obama\\'s efforts to restart diplomatic relations with Havana. Biden\\'s\\xa0serious consideration of California Rep. Karen Bass as a running mate also was damaging given her past praise for Fidel Castro, which she later renounced.\\n“Given the margins that Hillary Clinton won Dade County by and given how close Florida is, the Democrats have to put real resources in the Hispanic community,\" Moreno said. \"And they have to stop offending Cuban voters.\"\\nCardenas said the competitive presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who describes himself as a\\xa0Democratic socialist,\\xa0also appears to have turned off older Cuban Americans from the Democratic ticket, he said.\\nThe Biden campaign says it is not taking the Latino vote for granted. During Harris\\' visit in Doral, she spoke briefly with diners in the restaurant and met with\\xa0political strategist Ana Navarro and Democratic state Sen. Annette Taddeo. Navarro, who wore a Biden-Harris T-shirt, has participated in virtual roundtables with the campaign for Latino voters in Florida and Wisconsin.\\nThe campaign this past weekend also launched a series of television and radio ads aimed at appealing to Latino voters in Florida. Two of the ads focus on Trump\\'s handling of the economy and how Latino small business owners contribute to the economy. A third ad is focused on outreach to Puerto Rican voters in Florida that criticizes the president\\'s response to Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island in 2017.\\nAhead of the Florida primary in March, the Biden campaign also created Latino organizing groups in the state, such as\\xa0Cubanos Con Biden – “Cubans With Biden\"\\xa0— and Boricuas Con Biden, or \"Puerto Ricans With Biden.\"\\nThe groups have done digital organizing, phone banking and caravans, called \"Ridin\\' With Biden.\"\\xa0Cubanos Con Biden has called into local radio shows to amplify Biden\\'s campaign message and has held counterprotests to Trump supporters.\\nBiden\\'s Florida press secretary Kevin Munoz said the groups \"ensure that members of their own community are communicating to their friends, their families about Joe Biden and doing this really culturally competent organizing.\"\\n\"It speaks to the fact that we cannot just use a one-size-fits-all approach to reaching Hispanics,\" he said.\\nThe Biden campaign has tried to hit back against Trump\\'s messaging by doing interviews with local stations, including with Spanish-language stations Telemundo and Univision.\\nDuring an interview last week with\\xa0NBC’s local Miami station, Biden said Trump \"has done nothing to advance democracy and human rights; on the contrary, the crackdown on Cubans by the regime has gotten worse under Trump, not better.\"\\nBiden also accused Trump of failing Venezuelans, adding that he would\\xa0extend Temporary Protected Status to undocumented Venezuelans fleeing a humanitarian crisis in their country, which Trump has not done.\\n“Venezuelan people are worse off, living in one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world,\" Biden said, adding that the country is\\xa0\"no closer to a free election.\"\\nVisiting Pittsburgh last week, Biden also pushed back hard against being labeled a socialist.\\n\"Do I look like a radical socialist with a soft spot for rioters. Really?\" Biden said during a campaign event.\\nCollazo said some Democrats are have tried to combat the \"radical socialist\" messaging from Republicans on their own. She said she has a shirt that says \"Anti-Communist\" and wears it proudly.\\xa0\\nBut for Trump’s Cuban American supporters, it still comes down to that one word: socialism.\\nBob Woodward book takeaways:Trump admits \\'playing\\' down COVID threat, secret nuclear program, Kim Jong Un letters\\nRicardo Gomez, a former police officer turned criminal defense attorney in Miami, said his family fought too hard to flee Fidel Castro’s Cuba only to end up with a socialist-leaning administration in the United States. Gomez, whose father fought in the Bay of Pigs invasion and was held captive by Castro’s forces for seven months, doesn’t believe that Biden and Harris are moderates, but have instead adopted the most radical ideals of the Democratic party.\\n“They’ve adopted Bernie Sanders, they’ve adopted the AOC model,” said Gomez, 60, referring to progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “They’re not calling the anarchists in the street burning and looting what they are … street thugs.”\\nGomez supports the idea of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid – limited government programs that provide a last-resort safety net for people facing difficult times. But, he said, a Biden administration would push to vastly expand those programs, allowing people to become dependent on government handouts. And that, he said, strikes fear into the hearts of immigrants from Cuba or Venezuela or Nicaragua.\\n“The way communists and socialists work is they start taking from the top and distributing, but sooner or later they run out of stuff to distribute,” he said. “Do we want this to become another Cuba? Do we want this to become another Venezuela?”\\nMike Rivero understands that fear. The 30-year-old Cuban American has heard the anguish in the voices of his relatives and friends when talking about the upcoming election. But Rivero, who sells cruise packages, accused the Trump campaign of exploiting those fears by exaggerating, and oftentimes lying about, what a Biden presidency would look like.\\nMore:Where do Americans stand on election issues? Let them tell you.\\n“The ads down here, it’s Biden with a red background, he’s there saying he’s going to take your house,” Rivero said. “Yet we know that Joe Biden is a centrist. He’s more in the middle than Hillary (Clinton) was, he’s more in the middle than Obama was, and we know he’s not a socialist, he’s not a communist. But the Trump campaign, hats off to them. They’re basically using that fear to re-traumatize people. It’s triggering people to close up and refuse to have a conversation.”\\nHe likens it to the psychological concept of “ancestral trauma” – when the agonies endured by one generation are passed down to the next.\\nCardenas\\xa0said he doesn\\'t understand why so many fellow Cuban Americans who fled the repressive Castro regime support the president, given his embrace of autocrats such as Russia\\'s Vladimir Putin and North Korea\\'s Kim Jong Un.\\n\"They haven’t learned their lesson from 1958 when Fidel said he was not a communist and he would provide good governance for everybody. And people bought into that, including everybody who came into exile a year later. And now we have Trump who made all these promises, none of which have been fulfilled and people are buying into it again,\" he said. \"Clearly his authoritarian style seems to be a hit among some folks.”\\nBut Rivero said he’s hearing – quietly – from more friends and relatives that they’re leaning toward Biden. He joined Cubanos Con Biden.\\xa0He’s taken part in caravans flying the Biden/Harris flag and been shocked to see so many people honking, giving them the thumbs up and asking for lawn signs.\\nMore:A majority of Americans see Biden as more empathetic to those with COVID-19 than Trump, survey finds\\nIn the predominantly Cuban American neighborhood of Westchester, Trump supporters have held rallies nearly every Saturday outside Tropical Park going back to 2016. But now, Rivero said he and other Biden supporters have set up a competing rally at the same park each Saturday and have been getting similarly sized crowds.\\n“We do that so when people drive by it’s not all Trump,” he said. “They’ve tried to rent every corner of the city and tried to paint it as a Trump town. We’re trying to provide that outlet and say, ‘No\\'.\"\\n'},\n",

I don’t think so too much,” Trump said, referring to\\xa0the group of left-leaning activists who routinely protest against racism and the president.\\xa0\\nMoments later, at the same event, he said:\\xa0“The suburbs are the American dream, and I will tell you, I have protected your suburbs. You know, I got rid of a regulation that played with your zoning and played with other things, where they force projects into the suburbs of our great country. And I got rid of it.”\\nTrump\\'s reference was to an Obama-era\\xa0policy\\xa0canceled in July that required local governments to study and address racist housing patterns in their community.\\nFor some, the fact that the president\\'s\\xa0statements are misleading or racist does not matter. Fear is a powerful motivator.\\xa0There’s a chance Trump\\'s message will resonate with suburban women, a voting bloc where he can\\'t afford to lose any electoral ground. The campaign needs these voters to see him as the “law and order” president and cast a ballot in his favor.\\xa0\\nBut analysts, experts and Trump’s opponents agree many of his comments aimed at suburban voters are racist and out-of-touch. A new poll conducted for the Free Press shows Michigan women have the same top issues as men this election season: both ranked restoring the economy and jobs lost because of\\xa0the pandemic and managing COVID-19 as their top concerns. The death of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will also likely drive voters to the polls, due to concerns about the court\\'s composition and previous rulings on anything from abortion to marriage equality.\\xa0\\nThere\\'s a far greater chance\\xa0that Trump’s outdated message imploring so-called soccer moms to support him will actually motivate\\xa0suburban women —\\xa0already trending toward Democrats — to vote for Biden.\\nAnd while Detroit\\'s suburbs are demographically less diverse than bedroom communities\\xa0in other regions of the country, Bagchi and an\\xa0expert noted many people who identify as Black, Latino, Asian or a different ethnicity\\xa0already call these areas home.\\xa0\\n“When he says ‘suburban housewives’ I think he’s making a call to action ... for white women and not for somebody like me, or the many minority women who live in the suburbs. We have concerns too and certainly we don’t like to feel that our children or our spouses are a threat because they live in the suburbs, or that we’re a threat because of the color of our skin,” Bagchi\\xa0said.\\xa0\\n“So that, to me, was a pretty strong dog whistle. I don’t know if he used the word ‘invade,’ but he seemed to imply that people of color would be invading the suburbs. We already live here.

He goes with his gut instinct more than evidence, clearly,\" said Sue Carroll, a senior scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.\\xa0\\n\"He doesn’t necessarily look at the empirical evidence and formulate a strategy based on that. He works more off the cuff. It’s his notion of what the suburbs look like rather than anything that a demographer would tell you about what the suburbs look like.\"\\nThe strategy propelled Trump to victory in Michigan in 2016, when his message resonated to at least some degree with\\xa0suburbanites. Trump won all but eight of Michigan\\'s 83 counties in 2016, including Macomb County and Kent County, where traditionally strong GOP suburban support\\xa0canceled\\xa0out Democratic votes from Grand Rapids.\\nWhile CNN exit polls from 2016 do not break down voters by county, they do show Trump in Michigan managed to win 51% of all white female voters and 57% of white female voters who did not have a college education.\\nBut recent election trends in the suburbs, both in Michigan and around the country, are not in the president’s favor.\\nA new Free Press poll shows Biden leading Trump among all Michigan women by 20 percentage points.

The party is proud to run on Trump\\'s record, she said, specifically pointing to the economy before the pandemic.\\xa0\\n\"Under President Trump’s leadership, female unemployment hit an all-time low prior to COVID-19, and jobs were being created amongst women at a record pace. Currently, the stock market is back near all-time highs and last month unemployment plummeted nationally,\" Cox said.\\xa0\\nWhile unemployment rates for women were down in early 2020, they were lower in the early 1950s and have been decreasing since 2011, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which tracks national economic data.\\nCox also is not bothered by the president\\'s use of the term \"suburban housewives\" or how it might resonate with suburban women in Michigan.\\xa0\\n\"As a woman, I care far more about President Trump’s commonsense polices and record of results than anything he says on Twitter,\" Cox said.\\xa0\\nThe latest Free Press poll shows only 7% of voters are not sure who they will pick for president, echoing other poll findings that\\xa0show most voters have already made up their minds about the election. But both parties are fighting for the final few undecided voters,\\xa0especially in a state decided by the slimmest of margins last presidential cycle.\\xa0\\nFor years, campaigns have battled over suburban women. They are seen as politically pliable, Carroll said: While they traditionally lean Republican, Democrats could win them over.\\xa0\\nFrom the campaigns of Bill Clinton to George W. Bush, this pursuit resulted in something of a characterization, creating a largely fictional character perpetuating stereotypes about who lives in the suburbs —\\xa0namely, so-called soccer moms.\\xa0\\n“There was an interest in so-called suburban voters, but at that point they were called soccer moms. And so they were basically white, middle class, fairly well-educated mothers who had kids. The characterizations went beyond the data in the sense that they would talk about these women who drove minivans and took their kids to soccer practice,\" Carroll said.\\xa0\\n\"This is very similar to what George W. Bush did with security moms. It was just a different kind of, a different sense of security. It wasn’t law and order, it was \\'we’re going to protect you from terrorism and terrorists.\\' ...The nature of the\\xa0threat is different, that they’re trying to sell.”\\xa0\\nMore:VP pick Kamala Harris, an AKA and HBCU grad, connects with Black community on many levels\\nMore:Critics slam Trump \\'suburban housewife\\' tweet as racist, sexist \\'dog scream\\' play for white voters\\nIn theory, one could reasonably expect\\xa0a presidential candidate who is a woman to fare well with suburban female voters. But that didn\\'t happen with 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, at least not to the degree she needed to win.\\xa0\\nCarroll noted there was \"a significant chunk of women voters who just didn’t like Hillary Clinton.\" And the last presidential election still demonstrates that just because a woman — U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California\\xa0—\\xa0is a member of the Democratic ticket, it doesn\\'t mean suburban women will stampede the polls to vote for her.\\xa0\\nHowever, she could help mobilize volunteers\\xa0in the city and suburbs, Carroll said.

I don’t think it will appeal to most middle-class white women who are less likely to be worried about property values than more financially strained women might be,\" Lacy said.\\xa0\\nShe specifically examined\\xa0Macomb County, a must-win for either presidential candidate.\\nWhile Barack Obama won the county by about four\\xa0percentage points in 2012, Trump\\xa0won it by almost 12\\xa0percentage points in 2016.\\xa0Yet in 2018, Whitmer and Stabenow both won the county. Trump campaigned in the county days before the 2016 election, promising — incorrectly, it would turn out — that if he was elected no automotive manufacturing plants would close. Last week, Biden visited a UAW hall in the county.\\xa0\\n\"Warren, Macomb County’s largest city, is experiencing white population loss, leaving an opening for an influx of Black residents. The Black population increased significantly in the 2000s, from a mere 3,700 people at the beginning of the decade to over 18,000 by the end. The Asian population is growing there too. With a poverty rate of around 19% (in Warren),\\xa0Trump’s message may resonate with white residents of this lower-middle class suburb,\" Lacy said.\\xa0\\n\"But GOP gains in places like Warren will be offset by voters in places like Flint, where Republican leadership created a water crisis with long-term damaging effects for the city’s children.\"\\xa0\\n\\xa0Lacy also refuted assertions she said the president is trying to make regarding Black entry to the suburbs and lowering property values.\\xa0The first Black family in a predominantly white neighborhood typically increases local home values, Lacy said, noting long-standing racist impediments to Black home ownership frequently result in those who are able to buy paying an above market rate.\\xa0\\nStill, Lacy acknowledged the president\\'s message may find receptive ears.\\xa0\\n\"But some people will believe Trump’s misguided logic, and those homeowners will worry about losing their asset, about not having anything to pass down to their kids,\" Lacy said\\nShannon Epps is a suburban woman offended by the president\\'s comments and actions. The 44-year-old middle school teacher said Trump\\'s divisiveness has led her to no longer speak\\xa0with some of her Canton neighbors and former friends.\\nEpps, who identifies as multiracial, said anyone who supports Trump \"is accepting of discrimination and hostility toward minorities.\"\\xa0\\n\"During the last four years, my life has gotten worse, I believe, due to that awful person in office and the racist rhetoric he spews,\" Epps said.\\n\"In my community, my children have to listen to peers repeat his racist remarks and embrace division and support.\\xa0This has led to stress, anger and sadness which has caused my family to stop talking to neighbors and friends due to their support of someone that embraces white supremacy.\"\\xa0\\nMore:A second term for Donald Trump? Michigan is at the center of the political universe\\nMore:Livonia man: Yard sign meant to call out white supremacy — not promote it\\nJoyce Peralta said she has lost friends as well over the president. Peralta is, in theory, another prime target for the GOP — she\\'s 66, white, retired and lives in Beverly Hills in Oakland County.\\xa0\\nBut she said she cannot stand his words or his deeds. She said she can no longer write off her property taxes because of\\xa0the 2017 tax reform bill Trump championed. Peralta wants to see improvements to the Affordable Care Act and stability in funding for Social Security.\\xa0\\nAnd, like many of the women interviewed for this article, she is concerned about the lack of a concerted national strategy to battle the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19.\\xa0\\n\"Trump\\'s denial of the expert\\'s recommendations has prolonged the pandemic and cost more illness and many more deaths than there needed to be,\" said Peralta, a snowbird who typically stays in Florida until April.\\xa0\\n\"This year, we stayed until the end of May, when Michigan COVID (infection rates) improved greatly just as Florida cases were exploding. It was great to return to Michigan where masks and social distancing was practiced by the great majority of residents. Good leadership that follows\\xa0medical science makes a big difference in fighting COVID.\"\\xa0\\xa0\\nTina Oldford and Jennifer Hay\\xa0live in Howell, but made the roughly 90-minute trip recently to see Trump speak in Freeland. Neither joined more than 65,000 of their Livingston County neighbors in voting for the president in 2016.\\xa0\\nBut both plan to cast their ballots this fall, the first either say they\\'ve cast in a presidential election, for Trump.\\xa0\\n“Sure, we had a downfall. Everybody knows that we had a downfall,” said Oldford, 59, referencing the economic collapse that coincided with the coronavirus pandemic. “This could have happened to anybody. But the economy was great.\\n“I just felt more secure than I’ve ever felt in my life with Trump.\"\\nHay agrees. She said Biden cannot become president, and dismissed the idea that the president\\'s at-times vulgar and inappropriate conduct should disqualify him as a candidate.\\xa0\\n“He puts the people first, not himself,” said Hay, 53.\\xa0\\nBut many in Michigan\\'s suburbs and throughout the country blame the president for poorly handling the response to the pandemic.\\xa0\\nMultiple polls show Michigan voters favor Whitmer over Trump. Her approval rating is 56%\\xa0as of the\\xa0new Free Press poll, 13\\xa0percentage points higher than the president\\'s.\\nThat disparity is even greater when just looking at\\xa0women polled. Whitmer received positive marks from 61% of Michigan women polled, compared with 37% for Trump.\\nThe poll was conducted between Sept. 10 and Sept. 15\\xa0by\\xa0EPIC-MRA of Lansing for the Free Press and other media partners. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.\\xa0\\nMany of the women interviewed for this artcle support Whitmer\\'s actions on the pandemic.\\xa0Bagchi, the Northville dentist, said she understands some people are frustrated with some of the governor\\'s decisions.\\xa0\\nBut she thinks Whitmer\\'s hands were tied, largely because of\\xa0a lack of national strategy to fight the pandemic.\\xa0\\n\"I just wish that there had been more of a clear direction from the top for those of us who are just looking to kind of go back to normalcy,\" Bagchi said.\\xa0\\nIt\\'s a simple ask. Yes, Bacghi wants a president who can work toward ensuring her children and everyone\\'s kids have access to a quality education. She also wants to make sure Medicare and Social Security are protected, and that the U.S. Postal Service functions properly.\\xa0\\nBut right now, she\\'s trying to be a teacher and mother for two children while running a small business. At the moment, she\\'d settle for stability and returning to a life that feels normal.\\xa0\\nSomething she, and many other women in Michigan\\'s suburbs, said they do not believe\\xa0Trump is able to deliver.\\xa0\\nContact Dave Boucher: dboucher@freepress.com or 313-938-4591.

       "  'body': 'Democracy did not die in Hungary in 2015 when Prime Minister Viktor Orbán decided he needed an expensive border wall to see off a nonexistent \"invasion\" of asylum seekers.\\nWhen Poland\\'s government that same year started stripping power from the country\\'s courts by filling large swaths of the judiciary with apparatchiks loyal above all else to the incumbent right-wing populist party, the rule of law still applied.\\nTurkey\\'s leader was once seen as a\\xa0potential\\xa0model democrat in the Islamic world. Today, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is\\xa0the world\\'s biggest jailer of\\xa0journalists.\\nExperts agree that democracy is fragile, not preordained\\xa0and that a country\\'s descent into the type of illiberal politics\\xa0that has emerged in recent years in parts of Europe,\\xa0in Brazil, in India and elsewhere, has been nothing if not gradual. It creeps up on you.\\n\\'The country’s lost its mind\\':\\xa0Polls warning of civil war, violence shows deep partisan chasm over election\\n\"Little by little there\\'s a tiny change in regulations in, say, the justice system\\xa0one day. Then, later, appointments to high courts and ministries here and there. It may seem insignificant. You may not even hear about it,\" said Turkish journalist Ece Temelkuran, author of\\xa0\"How to Lose a Country: The 7 Steps from Democracy to Dictatorship.\"\\n\"Fascism does not walk toward political power in goose steps,\" she added,\\xa0referring to the straight-legged, stiff-kneed marching steps of soldiers usually performed during military parades and ceremonies and often associated with Nazi Germany.\\xa0\\nTemelkuran said her anecdotal impression is that many Americans tend to believe authoritarianism and other forms of threats to democratic freedoms\\xa0\"can\\'t happen here,\" because of the strength of U.S. democratic institutions. \"There\\'s also some arrogance in it. They think somewhere like Turkey is\\xa0a crazy country,\" she said.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt may not\\xa0help that there is\\xa0massive divisiveness over a basic\\xa0point: What is the most appropriate\\xa0term to describe President Donald Trump\\'s leadership style?\\nTrump\\'s supporters cheer an unconventional and gladiatorial figure who they claim\\xa0 defends their conception\\xa0of American\\xa0values and interests.\\xa0\\nHis\\xa0critics often use alarming if imprecise words like autocratic (ruler who has absolute power),\\xa0tyrannical (exercises power in a cruel or arbitrary manner),\\xa0despotic (rules by brute force), demagogic (exploits emotions and prejudice) and xenophobic (hatred of the foreign or strange).\\xa0\\n\"This is fascism at the door,\"\\xa0Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said of Trump\\xa0after he chose not to immediately disavow\\xa0white supremacy groups such as Proud Boys. Trump\\xa0was directly asked to do so during the first presidential debate with his Democratic rival Joe Biden. The FBI considers Proud Boys, which only admits men, \"to be an extremist group with ties to white nationalism.\"\\xa0\\xa0\\nWho are the Proud Boys?:Far-right group has concerned experts for years\\nAfter Trump appeared on a White House balcony on Monday night following his release from the hospital where he was being treated for coronavirus and said \"I led\" in regard to COVID-19, historian Anne Applebaum wrote an analysis in The Atlantic magazine in which she drew some parallels to historical scenes involving Italy\\'s fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, who loved photo ops.\\n\"Those staged pictures are what a lot of people want to see, and that false reassurance is what a lot of people want to hear. Don’t underestimate their power,\" wrote Applebaum, the author of \"Twilight of Democracy: The Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism.\"\\nHistory offers advice but not necessarily a guide.\\xa0\\n\"Some were recalcitrant; some tried not to show how much his favor meant to them; some were openly servile. In a short time, he was surrounded by a court of yes-men who frowned when he frowned or guffawed loudly whenever he deigned to tell a joke,\" the Polish-American poet Czeslaw Milosz wrote in 1951 in his book \"The Captive Mind.\"\\nMilosz\\'s words were written shortly after he defected from Stalinist-controlled Poland.\\nThey formed part of Milosz\\'s attempt to explain the rise of\\xa0totalitarianism (where people are completely subservient to the state) under would-be authoritarians (generally evoked as someone who exerts close and precise control over a repressive and centralized state authority). The latter is a phrase that Trump\\'s detractors have deployed to characterize\\xa0a president who has refused to rule out staying beyond his legal term, sent unidentifiable federal forces to quell protests,\\xa0described dissent as foreign interference\\xa0and who routinely disseminates\\xa0false and prejudicial information.\\n(Studies have shown that Trump is the single largest spreader of disinformation related to coronavirus and election topics.)\\xa0\\nIn his choice of\\xa0William Barr as America\\'s top legal officer, Trump appointed an Attorney General who has been prepared to reduce\\xa0the prison sentence\\xa0of the president\\'s close ally\\xa0(Roger Stone) against the objections of U.S. Department of Justice prosecutors,\\xa0while he has also\\xa0sought to\\xa0drop the prosecution of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn.\\nWho\\'s going to derail the U.S. election?:The culprit may be close to home\\nTrump\\xa0has described Kim Jong Un, a bonafide dictator whose regime has for years presided over gruesome state-sponsored killings and a nationwide famine, as a \"friend.\" Tapes from the journalist Bob Woodward\\'s\\xa0book \"Rage\"\\xa0reveal that Trump said he gets along better with foreign autocrats the \"meaner and tougher\"\\xa0they are.\\xa0\\nStill, it\\'s important to note that\\xa0the U.S. does not – yet\\xa0– have a totalitarian system, an\\xa0authoritarian leader or some other highly abusive and domineering form of government.\\xa0\\nThe U.S. has meaningful political participation by citizens. There is freedom of press, speech and religion. A robust political opposition and civil society provide a check on legislation, corruption and government decisions. Power is not so brazenly concentrated that state or federal authorities can demand blind submission. Trump\\'s domestic opponents are not customarily subject to government surveillance or arbitrary detention, notwithstanding protesters in Portland who described being held by federal agents while demonstrating against police violence and racial injustice.\\xa0\\nFederal agencies from the CIA\\xa0to the Environmental Protection Agency\\xa0regularly challenge Trump. There is a growing cottage industry of former White House staffers who have been free to publish\\xa0books and articles arguing that\\xa0Trump\\'s handling of everything from the coronavirus epidemic to his name-calling feuds with allies resembles a curious, chaotic and irrational mix of nihilism and temper tantrums.\\xa0\\nNone of these things are wholly true in places such as China, Russia or the Philippines, where strongman leaders exert tight control over political systems.\\xa0\\nChina\\'s\\xa0President Xi Jinping, for example, has defended detaining millions of Muslim minority Uighurs in what many call concentration camps\\xa0by insisting they are being re-educated with the \"correct\" outlook on China. High-profile critics and rivals of Russian President Vladimir Putin have a tendency to die from poison.\\xa0President Rodrigo Duterte openly admits – brags, even – about\\xa0authorizing\\xa0extrajudicial killings as part of his \"war on drugs\" in the Philippines.\\nMaria Ressa:Why her fight for free speech and\\xa0free press should be U.S.\\'s\\xa0fight, too\\nCritics may describe the Trump administration as dysfunctional and even open to abuse by bad actors. But the overall system\\xa0isn\\'t – as far as we know – maliciously rigged, according to\\xa0Leonard Benardo, vice president of the Open Society Foundations, an organization that promotes democracy and human rights.\\xa0\\nIn the U.S. there are still, Benardo added, \"fundamental democratic institutions that have been able to present those kinds of excesses\\xa0from happening. We don\\'t have people in the U.S. being \\'disappeared\\'\\xa0by the state\" or other unrestrained strong-arm tactics.\\nCase in point: After Trump cast doubt on the transition, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell vowed that there would be an \"orderly\" transfer of U.S. presidential power in January as there has been since 1792.\\n\"The U.S. is not on the brink of authoritarianism,\" said Ian Bremmer, the founder of the global political risk consultancy\\xa0Eurasia Group, in a recent tweet.\\nIn fact, according to Salvatore Babones, an American-born expert on authoritarianism at Australia\\'s University of Sydney, Trump is, if anything, anti-authoritarian.\\n\"It\\'s probably more reasonable to call him dictatorial,\" he said. \"You can\\'t be an authoritarian when you disrespect all major bases of traditional authority,\" Babones\\xa0said, referring to Trump\\'s unconventional and unpredictable leadership approach on issues ranging from\\xa0national security to campaigning.\\xa0\\nHowever, Babones noted\\xa0that Trump is dictatorial only in the sense that he appears to \"simply dictate his policies,\" usually via Twitter, rather than arriving at them through discussion. He does not have absolute power without any constitutional limitations.\\xa0\\n\"I would not say he is a dictator. A dictator does not have to satisfy a Congress.\"\\xa0\\nBabones added that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the only president to serve more than two terms, was also dictatorial in his governance style.\\xa0\\n\"He refused to step down. He threatened to pack the courts. The difference is that the American establishment liked his policies. So for many, he\\'s not viewed that way.\" \\xa0\\nJason Stanley, a Yale University philosophy professor and author of \"How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them,\" published in 2018, goes one step farther.\\xa0\\n\"Trump believes only in himself as an authority. It\\'s called the \\'Führer principle,\\'\" he said, a reference to the machinery of state that oversaw\\xa0Hitler\\'s Third Reich\\xa0–\\xa0commonly understood as an ironclad belief in the infallibility of the leader\\'s words and deeds. It led to the most extreme and calculated extermination campaign against a people in history.\\n\"Fascists target racial minorities and immigrants. They use the police in political ways. We are seeing all this with Trump,\" Stanley said.\\xa0\"We need to focus less on what the right word is to describe him and more on the consequences of his\\xa0actions.\"\\nIn addition to Trump\\'s refusal to commit to providing a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the election, the president has also\\xa0encouraged his supporters to monitor Election Day polling places for instances of fraud\\xa0–\\xa0a federal crime if they are not there in an official capacity\\xa0–\\xa0raising fears of potential voter intimidation, violence and disorder\\xa0more generally.\\xa0\\nThe number of Americans who feel\\xa0they would be justified in using violence to achieve their political goals has increased sharply from 8% in 2017 to 33% today, and three-in-four Americans believe there will be violence following the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to YouGov, an online market research firm.\\nAlthough Trump subsequently\\xa0said his words during the debate with Biden were misinterpreted when he told the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by,\" and he later also said he condemned all white supremacists, the group itself took his original remarks\\xa0to be a tacit endorsement of their violent tactics if the election doesn\\'t go his way, according to messages on the group\\'s messaging channel.\\nInternational evidence that the U.S.\\xa0should not be content to rest on its democratic laurels, that it too could be susceptible to the slow erosion of personal and democratic freedoms, is not difficult to find, according Benardo, of the Open Society Foundations, an organization\\xa0founded by the Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros.\\xa0\\nA decade ago, when Orbán came to power in Hungary the country was still grappling with the aftermath of the economic crisis\\xa0and relatively recent ascension to European Union membership. Since then Orbán has slowly but aggressively consolidated his executive power and critics say the country is now a democracy in name only.\\nDuring this time\\xa0Orbán has gutted the country\\'s civil service, redrawn electoral maps, appointed friendly judges, installed party loyalists to key watchdog posts in the media and promoted a version of Hungarian ethnic identity that is white, Christian and vehemently opposed to taking in refugees who, he claims, threaten \"our way of life.\"\\nThe impact has been widespread but also specific.\\xa0\\n\"I was cornered and cut off from everything,\" said\\xa0Béla Lakatos,\\xa0a former member of Orbán\\'s party and mayor of a small town who specialized in minority issues.\\nLakatos, who is ethnically Roma, a\\xa0minority group long discriminated against in Hungary,\\xa0said\\xa0he quit\\xa0his position in disgust over the Hungarian government\\'s immigration and Roma policies and was instantly\\xa0targeted by online trolls and government-controlled media who accused him of beating up children and other crimes.\\nHe also believes that he was effectively blacklisted from finding work as a school teacher, his profession before he worked for the government.\\xa0\\n\"(Orbán) has been\\xa0peddling the same stories in the countryside since 2015: Brown and Black people will come and steal your chicken and rape your wife,\" he said, noting that the government has created a culture of fear where lying has become routine and where many are afraid to speak out over concerns for their careers and reputations.\\xa0\\nOpen Society Foundations shut its office in Hungary in 2018, leaving behind what it called \"an increasingly repressive political and legal environment.\" Soros, who is Jewish, has become a bogeyman for unfounded conspiracy theories, anti-semitic tropes\\xa0and attacks by U.S. right-wing groups. Trump himself has pushed claims that Soros funds antifa, the radical left-wing political movement. Orbán rejects accusations of Hungary\\'s authoritarianism as \"fake news\" spread by his political opponents, including Soros.\\nTrump isn\\'t the only one who wants to built a wall.\\xa0These\\xa0nations already did\\nIn nearby Poland,\\xa0President Andrzej Duda and the powerful leader of his ruling Law and Justice\\xa0party, Jarosław Kaczyński, have slowly dismantled many democratic\\xa0checks and balances\\xa0by filling the ranks of the nation\\'s courts with loyal judges.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Law and Justice Party has tightened the government\\'s grip on state institutions and companies\\xa0including\\xa0the media, increased its powers to spy on its citizens and\\xa0imposed new taxes on\\xa0those who oppose socially conservative measures such as keeping gay marriage illegal, strict immigration laws and a proposed near-total ban on abortion in a\\xa0country that already has some of Europe\\'s most restrictive reproductive laws.\\n\"Poland has become a place where horrible intolerances, whether anti-semitism or racism, are now articulated freely in the street,\" said Mateusz Klinowski,\\xa0a law professor and former\\xa0mayor of Wadowice, the\\xa0birthplace of Pope John Paul II.\\xa0\\nIn 2019,\\xa0Paweł Adamowicz\\xa0, a friend of\\xa0Klinowski\\'s\\xa0and the\\xa0mayor of the Polish city of Gdansk who\\xa0espoused liberal causes including giving refuge to asylum seekers\\xa0at odds with Poland\\'s conservative nationalist government, was assassinated by a former convict during an annual charity event.\\xa0Klinowski has been stalked.\\xa0\\nTemelkuran, the writer from Turkey, left her country in 2016 after a failed military coup attempt against Erdoğan that led to\\xa0tens of thousands of soldiers, police\\xa0and civil servants being dismissed or suspended from their jobs, and thousands jailed.\\nA little over a decade ago,\\xa0Turkey was in serious talks to join the EU. Today, political opposition in Turkey has been so severely curtailed that it\\xa0is too dangerous for Temelkuran\\xa0and other outspoken journalists to\\xa0return and\\xa0Erdoğan has transformed\\xa0his presidential power into an\\xa0unassailable force that allows\\xa0him\\xa0to make law by decree.\\nTemelkuran noted\\xa0that Trump started questioning the perceived sacrosanctity\\xa0of U.S. institutions\\xa0and norms from the FBI to the courts right after he was elected. She said she was keeping an open mind about what this relatively quickened\\xa0trajectory could eventually mean for American political culture compared to that of Turkey\\'s and others\\', where tangible declines in democracy took several years to materialize.\\nTurkey coup:\\xa0One year later, country bitterly divided as crackdown continues\\nIn Brazil,\\xa0President Jair Bolsonaro was elected\\xa0on a platform to reduce crime and corruption and strengthen the economy. He\\'s spent the last few years trying to roll back the nation\\'s democratic order established after its military dictatorship ended in 1985.\\xa0\\nBolsonaro has tried to appoint military leaders to important civilian posts, undermined Brazil\\'s Supreme Court, accused environmental groups of deliberately starting wildfires in the Amazon and downplayed the gravity of coronavirus infections to deadly effect.

Gary Thomas, the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, has been quarantined since Tuesday along with most of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and several other officers who had been in a meeting last week with Coast Guard\\'s No. 2 officer, Adm. Charles Ray.\\xa0\\nThomas is\\xa0experiencing mild symptoms, but otherwise is feeling well, according to a statement from the Marine Corps.\\nThe military\\'s top two officers, Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Air Force Gen. John Hyten, the vice chairman, are among those senior commanders in quarantine.\\xa0\\n\"We are aware of General Thomas’ positive test for COVID-19,\"\\xa0Jonathan Hoffman, the chief spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement Wednesday night. \"At this time we have no additional senior leader positive test results to report. We will continue to follow CDC guidance for self-quarantining and contact tracing.\"\\n– Tom Vanden Brook\\nPresident Donald Trump released a nearly five-minute video Wednesday evening on Twitter to update supporters on his condition as he continues to battle COVID-19.\\xa0\\nTrump, who was dressed in a suit and not wearing\\xa0a mask, said the \"key\" to his recovery from the virus was the experimental antibody cocktail by drugmaker Regeneron that he was given on Friday before he was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.\\xa0\\n\"Immediately I felt as good three days ago as I do now,\"\\xa0Trump said in a video shot Wednesday outside the White House, according to his chief of staff Mark Meadows.\\xa0.\\xa0\\nThe president also said his administration was working to make the drug free for Americans.\\xa0\\n\"I want everybody to be given the same treatment as your president, because I feel great. I feel like perfect,\" Trump said\\nThe drug remains under development and is not yet approved for use in the United States or anywhere else.\\nTrump was able to get it under a \"compassionate use\" exemption, which the company said it has granted to fewer than 10 people so far, after requests from their doctors and approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a process that typically takes days to weeks.\\nThe president said his administration had asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve emergency use authorization of the Regeneron drug. Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, Regeneron\\'s competitor, has requested emergency use authorization from the FDA for a similar drug.\\n– Courtney Subramanian\\nPresident Donald Trump\\'s positive COVID-19\\xa0test was part of a broader White House outbreak that included his wife first lady Melania Trump, his press secretary and top aids.\\nBut he described catching the virus as a \"blessing from God\" in a video message Wednesday.\\n\"I think this was a blessing from God that I caught it.\" he said, adding that it was a \"blessing in disguise\" so he could understand firsthand the benefits of Regeneron\\'s experimental drug cocktail, which he has taken as part of his treatment.\\n\"I want to get for you what I got and I\\'m going to make it free. You\\'re not going to pay for it,\" he vowed.\\xa0\\nTrump previously reported he earned capital gains from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Gilead Sciences Inc., both\\xa0manufacturers of two medicines he\\'s taken as part of his COVID-19 treatment.\\nTrump\\'s doctors said the president continues to take the steroid dexamethasone and he completed\\xa0a five-day course of the antiviral drug Remdesivir on Tuesday. He\\xa0has also\\xa0taken zinc, vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin and a daily aspirin, doctors said.\\n– Courtney Subramanian\\nFour Democratic senators spoke with President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett on Wednesday.\\nSens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.; Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I.; Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.; and Chris Coons, D-Del., spoke with Barrett over the phone, rather than holding in-person meetings\\xa0like Republican senators did last week.\\xa0\\nAll four Democrats are members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the panel overseeing judicial nominations. Feinstein is the top Democrat on the panel, and Leahy is its former chair.\\nCoons told reporters he told Barrett her confirmation was “divisive” given it is so close to Election Day. He asked her about cases related to the Affordable Care Act because of\\xa0 Democrats’ concerns that the Supreme Court could overturn the law, but she declined to comment on cases that could come before the court, he said. The Delaware Democrat said Barrett had qualifications “appropriate” for that of a Supreme Court justice, but he still had concerns about “her judicial philosophy and her views.”\\nAt least seven Democrats have met with Barrett so far. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., a moderate Democrat, met with her on Thursday. In a statement released later Wednesday, White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said two other senators had also met with Barrett –\\xa0Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.\\xa0Klobuchar spoke with Barrett Wednesday, and Booker spoke with her \"last week.\" Klobuchar and Booker are also on the Judiciary Committee.\\nTwo members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, both tested positive for COVID-19 last week and have gone into quarantine. Hearings are scheduled to start Monday and Republicans aim to confirm Barrett before Election Day.\\n– Nicholas Wu\\nVice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen\\xa0tested negative for COVID-19 Wednesday, according to his spokesman.\\nMike Pence faces off against Sen.

USA TODAY reporters examined hundreds of photos and videos from news coverage and social media posts and scoured attendance logs to identify people who came in contact with those individuals.\\nAt least 6,000 people attended meetings, rallies and other gatherings with them within a week of the Sept. 26 Supreme Court nomination ceremony in the White House Rose Garden, now pegged as a potential “superspreader” event.\\xa0\\n– Josh Salman and Dinah Voyles Pulver\\nWhite House outbreak:White House coronavirus outbreak may have exposed thousands from Atlanta to Minnesota\\nOn Tuesday, Biden was in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the site of the defining Civil War battle in 1863 that ended up saving the Union, to make a point about the need to heal the country\\'s political chasms.\\n\\xa0\"Today again, we are a house divided,\" he said.\\n\"As I look across America today, I\\'m concerned the country is in a dangerous place,\" the former vice president said. \"Our trust in each other is ebbing.

CDC guidelines explicitly state that anyone who has been closer than 6 feet for more than 15 minutes with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 needs to quarantine for 14 days.\\nThe guidelines do not provide an option for “testing out” of this situation, she said. Because of a lack of transparency by the White House, which she condemned, she said it’s not exactly clear what his exposure was, but at the Rose Garden ceremony on September 26, he was within 6 feet of several people later diagnosed with COVID-19.\\n(By the way, want to get in on reporting? Help us ID people in this photo.)\\n“In my mind, I believe he meets the CDC definition for quarantine,” she said. “There are no guidances for how you should behave if you’re not going to quarantine, because you’re not supposed to do that.” But she noted that to go to the debate he would have to come into contact with many people, including drivers, hotel workers and servers. “All those people will be exposed, not just vice presidential candidate Harris through this,” she said. “This is where I really find it very important that we follow CDC guidance.”\\n- Karen Weintraub\\nWhite House officials continue to say different things about President Donald Trump\\'s situation, including whether or not he dropped by the Oval Office on Tuesday.\\nWhile doctors want to confine Trump to the White House residence as he recovers from an attack of COVID-19, one aide claimed he did wander over to the Oval Office on Tuesday – though others said he had only planned to go there.\\n\"The president actually showed up in the Oval Office yesterday with extra precautions,\" economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNBC.\\nWhite House spokesman Ben Williamson, however, said it didn\\'t happen.\\n\"While the President wanted to be in the Oval Office yesterday, he was not there,\" Williamson said. \"He stayed back in the residence working from there. Safety preparations have been underway in the event he moves to working out of the Oval in the coming days.\"\\nChief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters that Trump\\'s schedule is \"fluid.\"\\n“He wanted to go to the Oval yesterday. If he decided to go to the Oval, we’ve got safety protocols there,\" Meadows said.\\nAides are in concert with claims that Trump continues to act as president despite his illness.\\nOne thing for sure: The president is still tweeting. He tweeted or re-tweeted at least 40 items before 10 a.m. \\xa0Wednesday, many of them attacking Democrats and presidential nominee Joe Biden.\\n– David Jackson\\nSince Sept. 1, Trump and key Oval Office figures have violated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance on the coronavirus at least 27\\xa0times, ignoring recommendations on mask\\xa0wearing, social distancing, quarantining and more.\\n- Grace Hauck, Josh Bote\\nSenior White House adviser\\xa0Stephen Miller has tested positive for the coronavirus,\\xa0adding to a growing list of\\xa0White House officials who have tested positive since Trump was diagnosed last week.\\nMiller was one of several involved in Trump\\'s debate preparation who have since tested positive for the virus.\\nMiller is known as one of Trump’s main influences on immigration policies, including restrictions on\\xa0travel from Muslim-majority\\xa0countries and family separation policies at the southern border.\\xa0\\n- Savannah Behrmann\\nDr. William Foege,\\xa0former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, asked the current CDC leader Dr. Robert Redfield to expose the failed U.S. response to COVID-19, calling on him to orchestrate his own firing to protest White House interference.\\nIn a private letter, Foege, who has not previously been a vocal critic of the\\xa0agency\\'s handling of the novel coronavirus, called on Redfield to openly address the\\xa0White House’s meddling in the agency’s efforts\\xa0to manage the COVID-19 crisis and then accept the political sacrifice that would follow. He recommended that Redfield commit to writing the administration\\'s failures — and his own — so there was a record that could not be dismissed.\\n“Don’t shy away from the fact this has been an unacceptable toll on our country. It is a slaughter and not just a political dispute,” he said.\\n'},\n",

If you'd like to get The Backstory in your inbox every week, sign up here.\\xa0\\n“The candidates got two minutes uninterrupted to answer the original question that I posed to them,” said Page, USA TODAY’s Washington bureau chief. “When that time ran out, which they could see on their camera, I counted to three to give them time to finish. And then I began to say, ‘Thank you, Mr. Vice President, or 'Thank you, Senator Harris.’\\xa0\\n“That didn't always prompt them to stop. So sometimes I said it over and over again.\\xa0We didn't have a mic switch. I don't know that that would have been a good idea in any case.”\\nI spoke to Page in her Salt Lake City hotel less than an hour after she wrapped up the debate. The early feedback was it was a serious, substantial debate, but there was still too much talking over allotted time and interruptions. So why not favor a mic switch?\\n“Everything about a debate tells voters something,” Page said, including how the candidates handle themselves onstage. Also, “with both candidates, and especially with Vice President Pence, they didn't address the questions that I asked. That is frustrating to me because I spent a lot of time writing those questions, but that is illuminating in its own way to voters.”\\n'I'm speaking' vs. 'If I may finish': Pence, Harris spar over COVID-19 and other top moments from the VP debate\\nMany times, Page would ask a question, and Pence or Harris would answer a previous question, or move on to a different topic. What goes through her mind when they don’t listen or disregard her question?\\n“I had to hold back.\\xa0I had to restrain my normal reporter instincts, which would have been to interrupt, say 'No, that's not the question I asked,'” Page said.\\n“It’s not an interview, it's not a news conference. It's a debate. The goal of a debate is different and your agenda is different. In a news conference or an interview, I would've followed up and said, ‘You didn't answer my question.’ That was not, I thought, the appropriate thing to do in a debate.”\\nWhere is the line between a healthy debate and disrespect?\\nPage said that after each candidate had an\\xa0initial two minutes for answers, “I wanted them to challenge one another and debate. That's the point of a debate.”\\nAnd for those who think his interruptions were a sign of disrespect to Harris?\\n“When the opposition candidate was a male, which was last time in the 2016 debate against (Virginia Sen.\\xa0Tim) Kaine, Mike Pence, not then vice president, did the same thing. So I do think women have often had to deal with that, but I would be surprised if Pence would have not interrupted a male counterpart.”\\nThere was a point in the debate when both candidates aggressively talked over each other when discussing President Donald Trump’s feelings toward the military. Page had to forcefully interject and remind them their campaigns had agreed to the rules, and they needed to follow them.\\nShe had prepared for that\\xa0moment in a mock debate on her patio\\xa0when stand-ins for the candidates got out of control. She had practiced for it, even putting her hands up as a signal to stop.\\nThe\\xa0coronavirus was always going to be the first topic, she said, but the questions changed with news that Trump and many in his circle had tested positive. The campaigns met and decided who would get that first question. It went to Harris.\\n“More than 200,000 Americans dead in the space of a year in a pandemic that is not yet under control:\\xa0That is the most important topic facing the nation,” Page said. The next two topics were related to COVID-19, the question of presidential disability and the economy. “So in a way, the first half hour of the debate was focused on the coronavirus and its various repercussions.”\\nHere's everyone at the White House Rose Garden SCOTUS event now called a likely 'superspreader.' Help us ID them all.\\nManaging Editor\\xa0Lee Horwich\\xa0partnered with Page to prepare for the debate, along with\\xa0Anika Reed, a Life editor,\\xa0and politics intern\\xa0Sarah Elbeshbishi. The team was walled off from the rest of the newsroom to ensure that debate preparations did not mix with newsgathering activities.\\xa0We couldn’t know the questions she would ask as we\\xa0pursued our debate coverage – and we kept\\xa0the two separate.\\xa0\\n“We wound up preparing 14 topics pretty thoroughly, and then within each topic we knew we needed multiple questions,” Horwich said. The team wrote, and rewrote, questions as news continued to break, eventually winnowing to nine topics.\\nPage made it through eight, skipping immigration. She said they tried to draft narrow queries to try to get an answer.\\xa0“This was perhaps less successful than I'd hoped,”\\xa0Page said.\\nRead the full transcript of vice presidential debate between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris\\nAnd she made it clear she was refereeing on behalf of the Commission on Presidential Debates. She carefully balanced the time between the candidates, what she called “aggressive moderating.” She had clocks on her desk that showed the time used for each question as well as each candidate’s cumulative speaking time.\\n“Sometimes I gave Senator Harris a little extra time to talk to even things up,” she said. “I was prepared to let her go a little long on the two-minute thing, but she would stop at two minutes. And so that strategy did not work, but I was very conscious that they should have equal time to talk. Whether they're going to answer the question or not, they should have roughly equal time.”\\nModerator Susan Page hopes Mike Pence-Kamala Harris vice presidential debate was helpful for voters: 'That was the point'\\nIn the end, each candidate had almost the exact same time to speak. Pence spoke for 33.9 minutes, Harris for 34.5, according to a USA TODAY analysis.\\nAnd in the end, Page was pleased.\\n“Well, I didn't get answers to all the questions I had hoped to get. I think sometimes I got prepared speeches instead of spontaneous responses. That shouldn't be a surprise,” she said. “I hope that voters who watched it thought it helped them decide who has the policies they support, who has the leadership characteristics that they want to see.\\n“I hope it helped voters.”\\nNicole Carroll is the editor-in-chief of USA TODAY.

Something to think about.\\nIn California brings you top Golden State stories and commentary from across the USA TODAY Network and beyond. Get it free, straight to your inbox.\\nCalifornia’s ban on privately operated prisons and federal immigration detention centers is largely Constitutional, said a federal judge Thursday.\\nAccording to the ruling, private prison companies cannot open new prisons or immigration detention facilities in the state. They are also banned from extending or renewing existing contracts. An exception was made for private prisons operated on behalf of the U.S. Marshals Service.\\nLast year, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed AB 32, a first-of-its-kind law ordering that private prisons and immigration detention centers in California be phased out of use.\\nThe ruling is a blow to private prison companies operating in the state, some of whom are already facing intense scrutiny for their handling of coronavirus outbreaks at immigration detention centers. Nearly 20% of those\\xa0detained at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in San Bernardino County have tested positive for COVID-19. The facility is owned and operated by The GEO Group, which\\xa0operates three immigration detention centers and filed a lawsuit against the state that led to Thursday\\'s\\xa0ruling. A separate lawsuit was filed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The suits were later combined.\\xa0\\nState Assemblymember Rob Bonta, a Democrat who represents Alameda, Oakland and San Leandro and authored AB 32, was happy with the ruling. “AB 32 sent a powerful message that California opposes the practice of profiteering off the backs of Californians in custody,” Bonta said in a statement. “Just because the Trump Administration and Wall Street’s for-profit, private prison companies don’t like AB 32 doesn’t change the fact that the law stands on firm legal ground.”\\nMore than 200 elected officials from around the country have publicly announced their support of California in its ongoing battle with the Trump administration over its authority to set state-specific fuel efficiency standards.\\nThe issue at hand is a waiver that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted California in 2009, allowing it to write its own fuel efficiency rules for cars and light trucks sold in the state. Three years later, the EPA created national guidelines, which were not as strict as California\\'s — and they became even less so earlier this year when the Trump administration\\'s EPA rolled them back. It also revoked California\\'s waiver.\\nAs a result, a bipartisan group of elected officials from around the country signed a petition urging the EPA to stop interfering with actions that would reduce the state\\'s greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\"The effects on our climate are not just a concern of a city or a state or even the country. Climate change is the concern of the world,” Tucson Mayor Regina Romero said about why she signed the petition supporting California. \"Climate does not exist in a bubble. Whatever happens in California affects Arizona.”\\nBMW, Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and Volvo have all agreed to continue manufacturing cars using California\\'s standards, while other auto makers — including General Motors, Toyota and Fiat Chrysler — have welcomed the EPA\\'s rollback.\\nVoter fraud is an oft-discussed topic these days. But what about voter intimidation? As Election Day draws near, California is warning local officials to prepare for disruption at polling places and potential cases of voters being intimidated or blocked from casting ballots.\\nA memo sent this week from Jana M. Lean, chief of the state elections division, reminded county election officials that possession of a firearm at a voting location or in the immediate vicinity is a felony. Also a felony under California law is threatening or using \"force, violence or tactic of coercion or intimidation” to discourage someone from voting.\\nAccording to the article, it is also against state law for security guards to be stationed at polling locations.\\nCalifornia Secretary of State Alex Padilla has said that while he expects a safe election, counties need to be prepared for potential trouble.\\nThe nation\\'s most populous state, California has 21.2 million registered voters.\\nAnd while we\\'re on the subject of voting, a man in Santa Monica found dozens of mail-in ballots and other important mail that had been dumped in a trash can in an alley.\\nAccording to abc7.com, Osvaldo Jimenez found \"several dozen ballots, bank statements and bills all addressed to homes in the neighborhood.\" He later found a second trash can with unopened mail, including ballots.\\n\"If it was my ballot in there I would want somebody to recover it,\" Jimenez said. \"Every vote counts, whichever party it is.\"\\nIf that\\'s what you\\'re thinking, think again. A similar thing happened in Joshua Tree and Twentynine Palms: a batch of stolen mail that included voter ballots was found Wednesday morning, though investigators from San Bernardino County do not believe the ballots were the target.\\nThe items were all returned to the local postmaster for redelivery. Officials, meanwhile, are warning people not to leave mail in their mailboxes for an extended period of time, even overnight.\\nEven though the state of California is busy battling wildfires and COVID-19, it still finds time to bust illegal marijuana growers. In fact, its annual campaign against unlawful cultivation,\\xa0has eradicated more than 1.1 million plants and led to 140 arrests and the seizures of 174 weapons. In case you\\'re wondering, this year\\'s biggest bust — 293,000 plants — occurred throughout Riverside County, with\\xa0Tulare County coming in second with 105,723 plants.\\nMeanwhile, the Newport-Mesa Unified School District board voted Thursday not to reopen school doors for in-person learning for middle and high school students, reports abc7.com. The Orange County-based district based their decision on a letter sent to families last week by teachers saying that the preparations for in-person study were inadequate. The decision will be readdressed after the semester.\\nHave a terrific weekend, everybody!\\nIn California is a roundup of news from across USA Today network newsrooms.

The facility, owned and operated by private prison company The GEO Group, is one of the largest immigration detention centers in the country.\\xa0\\nAs of Sunday, 53\\xa0of 394 people had tested positive for COVID-19, Valdez said in court filings.ICE previously designated 20 of those 53 people as being at greater risk of complications from COVID-19 due to their age and preexisting medical conditions.\\nA dark milestone:US reaches 200K coronavirus deaths after Trump praises administration for doing \\'phenomenal job\\' on pandemic\\nNine of the 53 people who tested positive have been hospitalized since Sept. 10, Valdez said. Three have since been released from the hospital and are in medical isolation rooms, he said.\\nAdditionally,\\xa034 people tested negative and 307 were awaiting results, Valdez said. Each test kit is sent to an off-site laboratory, he said, and officials are receiving results in three to five days.\\n\"As testing results come in and the facility learns the full extent of the outbreak, mitigation plans are still taking shape, and will be modified as the extent and the location of the outbreak is defined,\" Valdez said.\\nICE, on its website Tuesday, increased the total number of active cases among Adelanto detainees to 58.\\nAt least two people detained at the facility described the situation as \"out of control.\"\\n\"Everyone is testing positive,\" Jose Tapete, a detainee\\xa0from Mexico who got a positive result on Friday, told The Desert Sun of Palm Springs, part of the USA TODAY Network.\\nA fall \\'twindemic\\':\\xa0Experts fear COVID-19, flu may be a deadly combo\\n\"I\\'m afraid of dying here,\" Jose Ricardo Viveros Rodriguez, 72, said in Spanish. He said Saturday that he was on a hunger strike to raise awareness of the risk he faces at the facility. He has diabetes and high blood pressure, which increase his risk of becoming seriously ill from the virus.\\nICE spokesperson Alexx Pons said Monday that no detainees are on strike at the facility.\\nOne of the dormitories, known as West 5, has been converted to a \"quarantine status,\" Valdez said. People in the dorm must remain in their rooms, which house no more than two people. They cannot visit the dining hall, so facility staff bring meals to them. They are allowed to use showers and telephones one room at a time.\\nPeople in the West dorm who are waiting for test results are treated as \"presumptively positive\" for the virus, Valdez said. They await results in rooms that typically house two detainees, he said.\\nJessica Bansal, a senior staff attorney for the ACLU of Southern California who is representing Adelanto detainees in a class action lawsuit, criticized ICE\\'s practice of holding two people awaiting results in a single cell for multiple days.\\nIf one has the virus, she said, it\\'s possible he will pass it on to the other during that period of time.\\n\"Literally, the results are meaningless,\" she said.\\nReferring to the outbreak, Bansal said, \"It\\'s just heartbreaking, because it was totally preventable.\"\\nSaturation testing of GEO and contract medical staff was expected to be completed by Tuesday, Valdez said.\\nAs of Sunday morning, 238 of\\xa0approximately 600 staff members had been tested for COVID-19, he\\xa0said. Of those,\\xa0eight had tested positive, he said. Those employees\\xa0have been instructed to quarantine at home, and will not be allowed to return to the facility for at least 14 days, he said. They will need to test negative for the virus before returning.\\nExperts agree that the outbreak \"was most likely caused by a staff member who reported to work at Adelanto infected with Covid-19,\" U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter Jr. wrote in an order issued Tuesday morning.\\xa0It originated in the West 5D dorm, with detainees initially being infected between Sept. 5 and Sept. 10, Valdez said.\\nRebecca Plevin reports on immigration for The Desert Sun.

       "  'body': 'THE VILLAGES, Fla.\\xa0— Sara Branscome’s golf cart whizzed down the smooth asphalt path that winds through The Villages, the nation’s largest retirement community, an expanse of beautiful homes, shops and entertainment venues that bills itself as “Florida’s Friendliest Hometown.”\\nBranscome’s cart was festooned with two American flags that flapped in the warm afternoon breeze. A line of oncoming carts bedecked with balloons and patriotic streamers chugged past while honking. Branscome jabbed her left foot on the horn pedal, then gave a thumbs-up.\\n“This gets you rejuvenated and ready for the next month or so, so we can do this and win. It gives you hope,” the 60-year-old retiree said.\\nThen she let out a whoop and two surprising words: “Go Biden!”\\nIt’s not a cry that might be expected to resound in The Villages, and it’s certainly not one that is encouraging to President Donald Trump. Older voters helped propel him to the White House — the Pew Research Center estimates Trump led among voters 65 and older by 9 percentage points in 2016 — and his campaign hoped they would be a bulwark to cement a second term.\\nThey remain a huge chunk of the electorate. Pew estimates that nationwide, nearly 1 in 4 eligible voters will be 65 and older. It’s the highest level on record, going back to 1970.\\nBut there have been warnings that older voters are in play. To be sure, Trump has solid support among older adults, but his campaign has seen a drop-off in its internal research, according to campaign aides, and some public polls suggest Democrat Joe Biden is running ahead or just even with Trump.\\nMostly, it seems, older voters have been put off by Trump’s handling of the coronavirus, which affects these voters more acutely than others. They were particularly alarmed by Trump’s performances at daily task force briefings in the spring because his remarks showed an uneven handling of the crisis and inspired little confidence.\\nThe president has tried to shore up his popularity with older adults. He has emphasized themes of law and order, and has warned that Democrats would preside over a sundering of the suburbs. He has promoted his prescription drug policy. And he has kept up steady visits to Florida — after Maine, the state with the oldest population — and advertised heavily there.\\nBut whatever improvement he saw is now in jeopardy. The president’s own COVID-19 infection has refocused attention on the virus and his handling of it. If the 74-year-old Trump can’t safeguard his own health, some wonder, how can he be trusted to protect other older adults who are far more vulnerable?\\nIn few places could any significant drop-off spell doom more profoundly than Florida, a state Trump almost certainly must win. Older adults historically are the most reliable voters, and Florida is infamous for its tight races. So even a modest drop in support could send Trump back to private life.\\nThe Villages, where the median age is 66, is built on the American dream of a golden retirement. “We’ve created the backdrop of possibilities for you to write the next chapter in your story,” its website says.\\nRetirees can enjoy everything from golf to seminars on Mark Twain to drinking a cold beverage in the town square while listening to a “jamgrass” band (progressive bluegrass in the vein of Phish).\\nPolitically, it long has been considered a conservative redoubt, so entrenched that it’s a must-stop for any national or statewide Republican running for office. One clear measure of its importance: Vice President Mike Pence’s scheduled visit Saturday.\\nThe Morse family, which developed the community northwest of Orlando, has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republican campaigns over the years. During the 2008 presidential race, GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin drew a stadium-sized crowd with 60,000 residents flocking to see her in one of the community’s town squares.\\nLast fall, Trump picked The Villages to promote his support for Medicare and its private insurance option.\\nBut on Wednesday, the scene told a markedly different story. An armada of as many as 500 golf carts gathered at the Sea Breeze Recreation Center to caravan to the nearby elections office, so folks could drop off ballots for Biden.\\nAs each cart rolled into the parking lot and slid a ballot into a locked box under the watchful eye of elections supervisors, dozens lined the sidewalk, cheering and clapping every time a vote was cast.\\n“I think we all came out of the closet for this election,” said Branscome.\\nIt’s not that there weren’t Hillary Clinton supporters in The Villages in 2016, said Chris Stanley, president of the community’s Democratic Club. There were.\\nBut there was also “an overwhelming sense in 2016 of ‘we’ve got this in the bag.’ There was a level of complacency that she’d win,” said Stanley. “Now there’s a heightened sense of urgency, and in many ways, Trump has been our best recruiting tool ever.”\\nIf the slow-moving, four-wheel, golf cart show of force is an indication of growing allegiance to the Democrat among the retiree set, it would represent a substantial shift. In Florida, 29% of registered voters are 65 and older. As of Oct. 1, 43% were Republican, 37% were Democrats and 17% were nonpartisan.\\nSusan MacManus, a University of South Florida distinguished professor of government and international affairs, said The Villages and its powerful voting demographic have become less Republican over the years because of an influx of more liberal people from the Northeast.\\nShe’s seen research that shows a softening in Trump’s older base, both nationally and in Florida — especially with women.\\n“That’s the group that’s leaving Trump,” she said. “And it’s because of his demeanor, more than his policies. For older women, especially. They went through the battles. They frankly do not appreciate the demeaning of women. More than that, they’re thinking of their children and their grandchildren.”\\nIndeed, at The Villages, many of the people riding in golf carts are women like Joan Morrill, a 76-year-old former Republican. The pandemic has weighed heavily on her, especially when she considers her four children and seven grandchildren. “We can’t live like this ...” she said. “I want a better world for them.”\\nJeff Johnson, the state director for the Florida AARP, believes voters over 65 are more “in play” in this year’s presidential race, largely because of Trump’s handling of the pandemic. In recent weeks, Democrats have seized on this softening of support and have rolled out six ads targeting older voters.\\nIn 2018, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of the American electorate conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press, older Republicans thought immigration was the nation’s most important issue, while older Democrats said health care was. But this year, with the pandemic, concern about health care has become a top issue for both.\\nThe Trump campaign seems to be paying attention. On Thursday, the president released a video of himself standing on the White House lawn in which he called older adults “my favorite people.” Noting that they are vulnerable to the virus, he asserted with no basis in fact that a medicine he said he was given in the hospital would be free to older people.\\n“The seniors are going to be taken care of,” he said.\\nThat is not how it has played out so far. Not only has Florida been slammed by the virus, but also no other demographic has been affected more than older people. About 93% of Florida’s 15,100 deaths from the virus have been people 55 and older, and many are scared — and enraged.\\n“The whole virus thing has hit really hard here,” said Branscome, who pointed out that almost everyone in The Villages moved there from somewhere else. “We can’t go see our families because of COVID. I’m not seeing an end to it. There is no plan. Biden has a plan. He wears a mask. It gives us hope.”\\nIn recent weeks, Morrill watched as Trump announced he was infected with COVID-19, left the hospital days later and dramatically removed his mask upon his return to the White House.\\nShe seethed.\\n“I was angry,” she said, her voice shaking. “He’s showing a bad example. He thinks that nothing’s going to affect him. It feels like one lie after another.”\\nFor the golf cart caravan, she wore a T-shirt that said “Team Fauci,” referring to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious-disease expert. “I trust the scientists and the doctors. I don’t trust Trump.”\\nThose sentiments extend well beyond the well-tended streets of The Villages. Ron Hood, 78, a retired college biology professor, lives on the Atlantic coast in Jacksonville. Hood, a Democrat, is voting for Biden. He, too, feels that Trump has left older adults behind.\\n“I do think there has been an attitude: ‘Well, it’s not that important to keep them alive and well. If we can’t, well, that’s too bad. Nice knowing you, bye,’” he said. “I just try not to dwell on things like that, though.”\\nIn rural Alachua County, which Clinton carried easily in 2016, 69-year-old Maxie Hicks is deeply troubled by the country’s direction and Trump’s leadership. Hicks, who is Black, said he’s been thinking a lot about the civil rights movement, when he was a teenager.\\n“I’ve never seen this type of cold-blooded hate, not even back then,” he said. “This is a Donald Trump funk. I’ve never seen this much hostility.”\\nThe retired state transportation department worker often thinks about how he and Trump are similar in age. “I don’t know how he could come through our generation and be so mean. So heartless. So insensitive. So indecent. So ungentlemanly.”\\nThe hostility that Hicks bemoans has played out even in “the friendliest town,” where Villagers who are Trump enthusiasts have held their own golf cart parades.\\nIn June, a fight broke out between Trump and Biden supporters in front of the Panera Bread shop, and one Trump supporter was captured on video yelling, “White power!”\\nPeople still talk about that, and there appear to be some lingering hurt feelings. On Wednesday, during the Biden rally, one woman in her golf cart decked out with Biden signs smiled and said good morning to a man coming from the other direction in a cart with a Trump sign.\\n“Shove it!” he said.\\nJudy Wise, a 75-year-old retiree in Plant City, a town east of Tampa on the Interstate 4 corridor, said her niece hasn’t spoken to her in years, since a fight over Trump. Wise is a stalwart supporter, and her niece is not.\\n“It’s not so much about the man, but the ideology,” Wise explained. She’s convinced that Biden and the Democrats have a “plan to unseat capitalism” and that he will be a “puppet” of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, progressive Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Biden’s running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris.\\nWise believes in small government and lower taxes, and she’s worried about the summer’s recent nationwide protests, a few of which have turned violent. She recognizes that Trump can be abrasive, but it doesn’t bother her, and she questions media reports that Trump had called servicemen and women “losers.” Trump wouldn’t do that, she said.\\nPamela Allen, 72, supported Trump from the time he came down the escalator in Trump Tower in 2015 to announce his candidacy. Every few weeks, she waves Trump flags on the roadside of her Tampa suburb of Holiday with a group of other Republicans.\\n“I love him. I think he’s doing a great job. He’s addressing the situations of everyday people’s normal everyday concerns,” she said. “He’s keeping his promises, with little to no help from the media or the Democrats. There is no positivity on anything he does.”\\nAs for the pandemic, she does think it’s serious for older people, but “it may be blown out of proportion.”\\n“I don’t believe the numbers they’re posting about deaths. I wash my hands. I wear my mask. I avoid getting very close to people I don’t know,” she said.\\nProfessor MacManus cautions that while some older voters have gravitated toward Biden, there are many others like Allen and Wise who are firmly in Trump’s corner. But that might not be enough for Trump.\\n“They’re still probably leaning more towards Trump. But in Florida, you look at margins,” she said. “He won the senior vote in Florida by double digits in 2016. And now we’re showing single digits in polls. ... Any bleeding of any cohort is a red flag for that candidate.”\\nAnd in this week’s golf cart caravan, the Biden flags were blue.\\n___\\nAssociated Press writers Jonathan Lemire, Josh Boak and Michael Schneider contributed to this report.\\n'},\n",

The widely cited reference to Barrett encouraging a “Kingdom of God” is\\xa0taken out of context.\\nFact check:No guarantee Obama would\\'ve replaced Ginsburg with a progressive justice\\nBarrett is a\\xa0conservative and a favorite among the religious right. Trump appointed Barrett to\\xa0be a federal appeals court judge in 2017, and she has since ruled in over 100 cases.\\nShe has previously been criticized by some on the left for her religious\\xa0views, with some liberal critics fearing that her beliefs would override her judicial impartiality.\\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., a fellow Catholic, pressed Barrett on her use of the term \"orthodox Catholic\" in an article she co-wrote as a law student.\\n“I’m a product of 19 years of Catholic education. And every once in a while, Holy Mother the Church has not agreed with a vote of mine. And (she) has let me know,” Durbin told Barrett. “You use a term in that article — or you both use a term in that article — I’d never seen before. You refer to \\'orthodox Catholics.\\'\\xa0What’s an orthodox Catholic?\" Durbin asked.\\nBarrett \\xa0acknowledged it was \"an imperfect term\" after which Durbin asked Barrett if she considered herself an orthodox Catholic.\\n\"If you\\'re asking whether I take my faith seriously and I\\'m a faithful Catholic, I am,\" Barrett responded. \"Although I would stress that my personal church affiliation or my religious belief would not bear in the discharge of my duties as a judge.\"\\nMore:Feinstein says she doesn\\'t \\'have the power\\' to block Trump\\'s Supreme Court nominee\\nSeparately, Barrett also replied to a direct question about judges and faith from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, saying it was \"never appropriate to impose a judge\\'s personal convictions, whether they arise from faith or anywhere else, on the law.\"\\nIn 1998, soon after finishing law school,\\xa0Barrett\\xa0co-authored an article titled “Catholic Judges in Capital Cases,” which ultimately concluded, “that Catholic judges (if they are faithful to the teaching of their church) are morally precluded from enforcing the death penalty.”\\nThat same article determined that for Catholic judges who were morally incapable of enforcing capital punishment, “the proper response is to recuse oneself.”\\nThe article includes a footnote that points to other legal scholarship making a similar argument about\\xa0recusal in abortion cases.\\nThe article also defended the idea that judges should be allowed to have an “ideological bias” on the basis that all judges have some\\xa0inclinations or leanings and that some judges are sometimes even selected for their ideological biases.\\n“Justice (Thurgood) Marshall was chosen by Lyndon Johnson precisely because he was a hero in the fight for racial equality. It would be odd if those principles kept him from sitting in school desegregation cases, even if they made his judgments fairly predictable,” the article reads.\\n“Judges cannot — nor should they try to — align our legal system with the Church\\'s moral teaching whenever the two diverge. They should, however, conform their own behavior to the Church\\'s standard. Perhaps their good example will have some effect,”\\xa0Barrett and her co-author ultimately conclude.\\nBarrett, who was a law clerk to and mentee of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, is also a textualist and originalist. She has written articles expressing criticisms and reservations about the role of precedent and principle of stare decisis,\\xa0suggesting\\xa0only a handful of cases in American history are beyond reconsideration.\\nIn her short time as a judge, Barrett has issued a number of conservative rulings that illustrate\\xa0her views on guns, abortion, sexual assault and immigration.\\nBarrett, a longtime faculty member at Notre Dame Law School, is a member of the university’s Faculty for Life group. She signed a 2015 letter to Catholic bishops affirming the “value of human life from conception to natural death.”\\nBarrett is a member of People of Praise, a majority-Catholic group that adopts many aspects of the Charismatic Catholic Renewal movement common among evangelical Christians.\\nFact check:Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed in 42 days. But it wasn\\'t an election year.\\nBarrett’s comments about building the “Kingdom of God” trace back to a 2006 commencement speech she gave at Notre Dame Law School.\\nShe encouraged the graduating class to “keep in mind that your legal career is but a means to an end, and as Father Jenkins told you this morning, that end is building the kingdom of God.”\\nMore:Supreme Court to hear another conservative challenge to Obamacare in the fall\\nBarrett then encouraged the students to adopt three habits that would help them maintain their Catholic faith after graduation. These included praying to God before deciding whether to take a new job; tithing one’s salary to the church or a charity; and finding Catholic friends and a parish wherever graduates intended to move.\\nThe phrase “Kingdom of God” is a common refrain among Christians throughout history. In the Bible, the phrase is most often used by Jesus to describe the state in which God reigns in heaven or in which his will is\\xa0enacted on Earth.\\nChristian sects and scholarly work\\xa0differ on interpretations of the phrase, with some claiming that it is a perpetual state sought after on Earth while others claim it is something that can only arise after Judgment Day.\\nRegardless, in the context of the speech, Barrett was not arguing for an end to the separation of church and state, but rather\\xa0for their Catholic faith to play a central role in the lives of the graduates she was addressing.\\n“I think you will find, when you enter the legal profession, that most of your colleagues, by default or by design, treat the legal profession as an end in and of itself,” Barrett said.\\n“Don’t let that happen to you; set your sights higher than that. No matter how exciting any career is, what is it really worth if you don’t make it part of a bigger life project to know, love\\xa0and serve the God who made you?” Barrett also emphasized.\\nFact check:In 2016, Trump didn\\'t tweet about replacing Scalia on Supreme Court\\nUnderlying claims about whether Barrett opposes the separation of church and state is the question of whether judges can separate their religious views from their judicial decisions.\\nBarrett, in her 1998 article and elsewhere, has said judges should conform to civil law but also that \\xa0they should be expected to have personal values\\xa0that may influence their rulings.\\n“Whether someone is Catholic, or Jewish, or Evangelical, or Muslim or has no faith at all is irrelevant to the job of a judge and it’s unconstitutional to consider it a qualification for office,” Barrett said in 2019,\\xa0while speaking to the Washington campus of Hillsdale College. “Most people have moral convictions whether or not they come from faith.”\\nBarrett has made clear that her faith guides much of her life, but USA TODAY \\xa0did not find any instance where she explicitly calls for a weakening of the separation of church and state or\\xa0for the constitutional principle\\xa0to be done away with.\\nFact check:False claim suggesting Trump nominated Biden to the Supreme Court started out as satire\\nJudge Amy Coney Barrett is a deeply religious person who holds conservative \\xa0views about the law and the task of adjudicating cases.

During a 2006 speech, she did speak about bringing about the \"Kingdom of God,\" but – in context\\xa0–\\xa0she was not referring to ending the separation of church and state.\\xa0We also found no evidence that Barrett has ever directly advocated for an end to the bedrock principle of separation of church and state.

He said the company has turned to the tools when\\xa0\"the situation on the ground is spiraling\\xa0into a chaotic and violent form of civil strife.\"\\nStoking fears of a contested U.S. election,\\xa0President Donald Trump has warned repeatedly the November election will be the \"greatest election disaster in history.\" The president has\\xa0accused Democrats of seeking to rig the election through mail-in ballots, which he\\'s slammed without evidence as being more fraudulent than voting in person. Trump has complained about the weeks it might take election officialsto count all absentee ballots, and he\\'s\\xa0not been clear whether he would accept election results.\\xa0\\xa0\\nA study from the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group\\xa0found nearly 1 out of 4 voters – 22% of Democrats and 21% of\\xa0Republicans\\xa0–\\xa0said some amount of \"violence\" would be justified if the candidate they oppose wins the White House.\\xa0\\nMore:Experts held \\'war games\\' on the Trump vs. Biden election. Their finding? Brace for a mess\\nSeeking to avoid a\\xa0repeat of the 2016 presidential election,\\xa0Facebook\\xa0this month strengthened measures to prevent interference and misinformation\\xa0from Trump and other political candidates including barring new political ads in the week before Election Day.\\nAfter the election, Facebook says it will crack down on any attempt by candidates to claim false victories or delegitimize the results by directing users to accurate information on the election results.\\n\"We will inform users with a very visible label on top of Donald Trump\\'s post\\xa0– if what he\\'s trying\\xa0to do is claim premature victory\\xa0– saying that the election results are not yet finalized,\" Clegg said\\nMore:Russia \\'very active\\' in 2020 election; antifa not a terror group, FBI director testifies\\nFBI Director Chris Wray\\xa0told lawmakers last week that Russia remains \"very active\" in its effort to disrupt the vote, primarily by denigrating Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Four years ago, Russia waged similar efforts to hurt Democrat Hillary Clinton and help Trump.\\n\"The biggest difference between 2016 and 2020 is that in 2016, Russian actors were caught doing this after the election,\" said\\xa0Nathaniel Gleicher, head of security policy at Facebook. \"This year they\\'ve been caught months and years in advance.\"\\nGleicher said Facebook has identified 100 networks of \"coordinated, inauthenticated behavior\" designed to deceive voters in the past three-plus years\\xa0– information that the company makes publicly available. He said Facebook has identified four separate networks in the past six months linked to Russian actors.\\nHe said actors looking to interfere have gotten more creative but he believes\\xa0they are less effective today than in 2016.\\nRather than creating fake Facebook accounts, he said more Russian-linked actors are targeting\\xa0activists to help them amplify their message or, in a new trend, targeting journalists to push op-eds under fake names.\\n\"There are no guarantees in security,\" Gleicher said.\\xa0\"That\\'s very important to say. But all the patterns that we are seeing, all the evidence we\\'re seeing, is we are catching them much faster and it\\'s much, much harder for them than it used to be.\"\\xa0\\nMore:Facebook election turnout: Company says it has already registered 2.5 million Americans to vote\\nClegg said Facebook\\'s heightened\\xa0efforts against Russian disinformation this election\\xa0are \"unrecognizably\\xa0different\" than the approach before the 2016 election. As a result, he said he believes the bigger challenge is combating internal players trying to spread \"disinformation, hate and polarization.\" The company\\xa0said the majority of takedowns globally tend to be domestic including several recently.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\"It\\'s arguably a bigger challenge this time around than the foreign\\xa0and Russian interference was last time,\" Clegg said.\\xa0\\nFacebook has been less aggressive in policing social media posts from the president than Twitter, which has flagged tweets for being factually inaccurate or glorifying violence. That posture has set off a firestorm of criticism inside and outside the company, but founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has held firm in his statements that Facebook is a free speech zone and that the public needs to see newsworthy posts from political candidates.\\nDefending Facebook\\'s efforts, Clegg said pointed to the company\\'s Voter Information Center, which he billed as \"the most ambitious attempt of its kind anywhere, publicly or privately.\" He said the company has helped registered 2.5 million people voters and recruit thousands to sign up as poll workers.\\n\"There will always be people who will say that Facebook doesn\\'t do enough,\" Clegg said.\\xa0\"That\\'s always the case. And I certainly don\\'t want to suggest that we\\'re in anyway complacent that we\\'re doing enough. We\\'re always striving to do more.\"\\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'WASHINGTON – The coronavirus pandemic is at the top of mind for many\\xa0voters, and it has been one of the main topics at both the first presidential debate and the only vice presidential debate this year.\\nBut a slew of key issues have been left out of the conversation as absentee voting,\\xa0COVID-19, health care and the pending Supreme Court faceoff have dominated the news.\\nHere are some topics that haven’t been brought up or really discussed at the debates thus far:\\nTrump’s hard-line immigration policies have been controversial throughout his presidency.\\nThroughout his tenure, Trump’s administration: used a family separation policy along the U.S.-Mexico border, which has since been halted but continues in isolated cases; faced criticisms over conditions for migrants at the border; enacted a travel ban for mostly Muslim-majority countries; and most recently slashed the number of refugees allowed to resettle in the U.S.\\nDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden also has taken heat from immigration activists who have criticized the\\xa0Obama administration’s deportation policies and history.\\nBoth candidates, and their running mates Mike Pence and Kamala Harris, have yet to discuss any of those issues on the debate stage.\\xa0\\nSusan Page, USA TODAY\\'s Washington Bureau chief and moderator of Wednesday\\'s\\xa0vice presidential debate, said she had to cut a planned segment on immigration due to time constraints.\\nThe lack of discussion on the topic didn\\'t go unnoticed by experts\\xa0online.\\nJacob Soboroff, an NBC News correspondent who covered immigration and border separations and author of \"Separated: Inside an American Tragedy,\" wrote on Twitter: \"The Trump administration systematically took over 5,500 kids from their parents at the border knowing it would traumatize them for life, and there hasn\\'t been a single question about it – nor any question about immigration policy – at either of the first two debates.\"\\nMass shootings have plagued the United States for years, and the country has seen\\xa0several occur in the past few years. That includes Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, in 2018 that left 17 dead\\xa0and the El Paso Walmart shooting in 2019.\\xa0\\nOne of the Democratic primary debates was held just weeks after the El Paso shooting, where a white gunman drove to the border city in Texas with the intent to shoot Latinos. Twenty three people died and another 23 were injured.\\nBut gun control\\xa0has not been discussed in the general election debates. Neither have gun rights issues.\\nLast year, the United States saw more than 400 mass shootings in the U.S., according to data from the group, Gun Violence Archive. This year has also seen a high number of people who have died from\\xa0gun violence, and will likely be the deadliest year for gun related homicides.\\nPence has been criticized by many on the left for his record on issues specific to the LGBTQ\\xa0community.\\nBut the vice president didn’t address any of those issues at Wednesday’s debate.\\nWhile governor of Indiana, Pence signed the into law the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,\\xa0which was modeled after the 1993 federal law. Critics have said it could be used to discriminate against the gay and lesbian communities.\\nPence during his dozen years in Congress\\xa0also advocated for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, opposed measures to protect gay men and lesbians from discrimination in the workplace and opposed expanding the definition of hate crimes to cover offenses based on a victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity.\\nHarris has previously introduced the \"Do No Harm\" legislation to amend the federal religious freedom act, saying it’s been used to discriminate against LGBTQ individuals, women and children in the guise of protecting freedom of religion.\\nHarris has also been previously criticized for legal briefs she wrote as\\xa0California attorney general where she denied gender reassignment surgery for transgender inmates. She has since said she takes \"full responsibility\" for the legal briefs, according to the Washington Blade.\\nSarah Kate Ellis, CEO and president of GLAAD, criticized the vice presidential debate for not bring up issues important to the LGBTQ community.\\n“This is the fourth missed chance in a nationally-televised forum of the general election to address any LGBTQ issues,” Ellis wrote in a tweet. “VP Pence should have been called to account for his role in the administration\\'s 181 attacks against the LGBTQ community. #VPDebate”\\nThe two campaigns have yet to debate their stances on\\xa0education, including their policies related to higher education, school voucher programs\\xa0and student loan debt.\\nThroughout the Democratic primary, education was key policy area that each Democratic contender\\xa0addressed, whether it was touting plans for free college or plans related to lessening the burden of student loan debt.\\nBut voters haven\\'t gotten to see any discussion of those issues on the debate stage with either Trump and Biden or Harris and Pence.\\nInstead, the conversation off the debate stage has shifted to reopening school safely amid the coronavirus pandemic. Ahead of the fall semester, Trump pushed for schools to reopen, while Biden had criticized the president\\'s stance and advocated for science-based decisions.\\nWhile both Trump and Biden have talked about criminal justice reform on the campaign trail, where they stand on drug policy\\xa0hasn\\'t been a large part of the conversation either on the debate stage or off.\\nHundreds of people, particularly people of color and especially Black men, have been convicted and are still in jail for selling marijuana, while a growing number of states\\xa0have legalized the drug at a recreational or medicinal level, or both.\\xa0\\nBiden has previously said he supports decriminalizing marijuana\\xa0but has not supported legalization. Trump hasn\\'t been as clear about where he stands on legalizing marijuana. Last year when asked whether his administration would legalize marijuana federally, Trump said\\xa0right now, his team is letting state\\'s decide.\\nTrump over the past several weeks has said he\\'s saving the suburbs from low-income housing.\\nThe comment, which is part of his campaign message touting himself as the president of \"law and order,\" has largely been seen as a dog-whistle related to race. While suburbs in general are becoming more diverse, they for years have been\\xa0largely white at least in part due to policies that have kept Black Americans out.\\nThe coronavirus pandemic, which has caused a recession, has also created a housing crisis, where home prices are surging and many Americans are facing eviction after losing jobs amid the pandemic.\\xa0\\nBut the topic of affordable housing has not been discussed further on the debate stage.\\nBiden has released a comprehensive housing policy plan. In the plan, Biden said $100 billion would be put into an \"Affordable Housing Fund,\" with $65 billion\\xa0of that funding being put to\\xa0\"new incentives for state housing authorities and the Indian Housing Block Grant program to construct or rehabilitate low-cost, efficient, resilient, and accessible housing in areas where affordable housing is in short supply.\"\\nContributing: Maureen Groppe\\n'},\n",

Dorothy\\'s lesbian friend, Jean (Lois Nettleton), visits in Season 2\\xa0episode “Isn’t It Romantic?” and falls for Rose, who doesn’t reciprocate Jean’s feelings but warmly embraces her as a friend all the same.\\nThe show also tackled the coming out of Blanche’s brother, Clayton (Monte Markham), and her own homophobia, in a pair of episodes: Season 4’s “Scared Straight” and Season 6’s “Sister of the Bride.” The latter is particularly hard-hitting, as Blanche struggles to accept Clayton’s partner Doug (Michael Ayr) and makes herself the victim. “What did you mean when you told me you could accept my being gay?” Clayton asks Blanche. “Did you mean it was OK as long as I was celibate? OK\\xa0as long as I don’t fall in love?”\\n\"Golden Girls\" tackled the AIDS crisis head-on in Season 5’s \"72 Hours,\" which aired in 1990. In the episode, Rose is informed that she may have contracted HIV during a blood transfusion years earlier and is told to get a test. Anxiously awaiting the results, she asks Blanche, \"Why is this happening to me? I mean, this shouldn\\'t happen to people like me.\" To which Blanche replies, \"AIDS is not a bad person\\'s disease, Rose. It is not God punishing people for their sins.\"\\nIn Season 4 episode \"High Anxiety,\" Rose shocks the group when she reveals she\\'s\\xa0been hooked on painkillers for more than 30 years, starting with a back injury. The girls try to get her to kick her habit by staying up with her all night and ensuring she doesn’t use them for 24 hours, but Rose eventually caves. After saying she’s “too embarrassed” and “ashamed,” she reluctantly checks into rehab. “What is there to be ashamed of?” Dorothy tells her. “You have a medical problem.”\\nYears before President Donald Trump enacted his “zero tolerance” immigration policy and kids in cages made headlines, “Golden Girls” tackled the cruelties of deportation in a Season 2 episode, “Dorothy’s Prized Pupil.” Dorothy secretly enters her favorite student, Mario (a young Mario Lopez)\\xa0in a writing contest for his essay on what it means to be American. He wins and earns media attention, but soon gets a visit from U.S. immigration officials, who deport\\xa0him for his illegal status. “I read a story once that said that in America you always feel like you\\'re among friends,” Dorothy tells Mario near the end of the episode, referring to his essay. “That was just a story,” Mario replies.\\nIn Season 5 episode “Not Another Monday,” Sophia’s friend Martha (Geraldine Fitzgerald) reveals that she is planning to end her life and wants Sophia to be there when she does. Afraid of growing older and feeling she has nothing to live for, Martha nearly goes through with the suicide plan, until Sophia talks her out of it, saying, “You\\'re not as ready to die as you think you are. You still wanna live, kid.” They promise to be there to comfort and talk to each other as friends, reminding viewers that depression is a very real struggle for senior citizens that often goes unnoticed.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'MONTGOMERY, Ala. —\\xa0The University of Alabama Board of Trustees\\xa0voted this week to rename a campus hall that honored\\xa0a\\xa0white supremacist.\\nTrustees voted unanimously to rename Morgan Hall, named for U.S. Sen.\\xa0John Tyler Morgan in 1910, to the English Building for the time being.\\xa0Trustee John England said Thursday he hopes the building will be renamed for an \"appropriate individual\" in the future.\\xa0\\nA Confederate general, Morgan later served for three decades in the Senate. He was known for his expansionist policies, playing a large role in what would eventually become the Panama Canal, and England noted that Morgan successfully lobbied Congress for a large and profitable land grant that substantially contributed to the university.\\xa0\\nBut England said trustees who reviewed Morgan\\'s history agreed he was an \"ardent white supremacist.\"\\nWhile speaking on the floor of the U.S. Senate in 1890 against a bill designed to protect voting rights, Morgan said the \"condition of the country would be better\" without the 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees voting rights to men regardless of race or color.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMore:As calls to remove Confederate monuments grew louder, states passed new laws to protect them\\n\"He referred to African Americans as \\'rats\\' from the floor of the U.S. Senate and said slavery was the \\'highest point the Negro race could achieve.\\' Of course, that means me,\" said England, who is Black. \"As our research confirmed, Sen. Morgan laid the groundwork for the Jim Crow laws that would disenfranchise African Americans for decades.\"\\nEngland also noted Morgan\\'s staunch advocacy for \"mass immigration for African Americans\" as an attempt to \"send us out of this country we worked to help build.\"\\nSome campus members have long advocated for renaming myriad buildings and landmarks on the University of Alabama campus with direct ties to white supremacists and the Confederacy, a government specifically founded on the idea of white supremacy. Students have for years petitioned for the renaming of Morgan, while academics such as associate professor Hilary Green have devoted scholarship to researching the university\\'s direct ties to slavery.\\xa0\\nIn the wake of a massive civil rights movement this summer\\xa0— sparked by the police killing of George Floyd and subsequent national discussions of systemic racism throughout the country\\xa0— institutions such as UA have finally moved to officially address those concerns.\\nA summer petition circulated by UA students drew more than 17,000 signatures urging university leaders to rename buildings named for slave owners and white supremacists. The school\\'s Student Government Association soon urged administrators to take action.\\nMore:University of Alabama to remove plaques that honor Confederates, study renaming buildings\\nOn June 8, President Pro Tempore Ronald Gray appointed a working group of trustees to study the history of campus landmarks and building names. A day later, the school removed plaques honoring Confederate soldiers on the campus quad.\\xa0\\nIn August, trustees voted to rename Nott Hall, a building housing UA\\'s honors college. The hall honored\\xa0Josiah Clark Nott, a physician and fervent defender of slavery who had tenuous connection to the university.\\xa0\\nOpinion:While Auburn hides behind law, Troy University takes racist name off building\\nBut some on campus are calling for additional transparency and input in the working group\\'s process.\\xa0\\nFollowing the renaming of Nott Hall, an employee union chapter released a statement that state workers were \"disappointed\" to not have a seat at the table during discussions. United Campus Workers also said they were \"outraged\" that the hall was renamed to the generic Honors Hall instead of commemorating a Black Alabamian who has contributed to the university and Alabama.\\xa0\\nIn a board resolution officially adopting the name change, trustees announced UA plans to display a plaque in the location where Morgan\\'s portrait once hung inside the hall. The plaque will feature the following language:\\n\"In 1910, at this building’s dedication, the University of Alabama’s Board of Trustees named it Morgan Hall, for John Tyler Morgan of Selma. A longtime state political leader, Morgan had died three years earlier, but had served as one of Alabama’s U.S. Senators for the last thirty years of his life.\\nAs a Senator, Morgan rendered the University a vital service in a time of need. In 1884, he successfully lobbied Congress for a federal land grant of 46,080 acres to compensate for University buildings burned by Union troops almost twenty years earlier, in the closing weeks of the Civil War. Until that grant, for almost two decades after the war, the University had struggled to survive financially. Revenue from leases and sales of this land funded the construction of at least five new buildings and other major campus improvements. It helped the University regain a more solid financial footing on which it would continue to build. Lease revenues still benefit the University today, and the University continues to be grateful for Senator Morgan’s efforts on its behalf.\\nSenator Morgan was, however, also an ardent white supremacist. He led Alabama in suppressing the rights of African Americans and denying them full citizenship, and these efforts were a core element of his work for half a century. Senator Morgan defended slavery before the Civil War, advocated secession from the Union to protect slavery, led in restoring white control after the Civil War, and helped establish the system of racial segregation. His harsh actions and strident words contributed to decades of racial injustice in Alabama and the United States.\\nBecause these actions conflict so profoundly with the current values of the University of Alabama System, the Board of Trustees voted on September 17, 2020, to remove Senator Morgan’s name from the building. The Board also called for the placement of this plaque to explain the reasons both for the University’s gratitude to Senator Morgan and for the decision to change the building’s name.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': \"Like most Americans, I didn’t watch President Trump’s town hall on Tuesday night. I was too busy doing anything else.\\nTwo days later, I capitulated and watched it on demand. Five minutes later, Joe Biden’s town hall began. The contrast was startling.\\nUnlike Trump — who sat during his town hall — Biden stood during his, as if the national anthem were playing. Trump looked lumpish and sounded confused. Biden looked spirited and sounded human. He was lucid, informed and affable — almost superhuman.\\nAs Rick Wilson\\xa0pointed out, Trump makes Biden seem like Demosthenes. Indeed, Biden uttered more complete sentences in one night than Trump has in his entire presidency. When Trump talks about vaccines, he sounds like an infomercial host peddling miraculous crystals that cure depression and hair loss. When Biden talks about vaccines, he sounds like someone who has studied them. This is not to say he was flawless. He got some facts wrong — Trump didn’t hold a Bible upside down at Lafayette Square — but he got the tone right.\\nTrump, who claims to speak for “real Americans,” was visibly uncomfortable speaking with real Americans. These were undecided voters, not sycophants or Fox News hosts, and persuading undecided voters to support Trump at this point — amid a pandemic and a recession — is harder than selling asbestos to them.\\nDemagogues become popular because they talk about things that matter to people. In 2016, Trump talked about immigration, the opioid crisis and political correctness — things that no one else was talking about. This year, he’s talking about things that no one cares about: Confederate flags, Goodyear tires and his Twitter account. He’s a demagogue increasingly disconnected from the demos.\\nUnlike in 2016, Trump can’t afford to talk about the country’s biggest problems because he’s primarily responsible for them. When he talks about problems, he denies they’re problems. He tells sick people they’re healthy and unemployed people that the economy is booming. To appeal to voters, he has to lie to them, and on Tuesday he lied to their masked faces.\\nBlack Lives Matter debate:I'm a Democrat who worked with police for 28 years. I wish everyone knew them like I did.\\nTo a woman suffering from an inflammatory disease called sarcoidosis who was worried about losing her health insurance, Trump told her he would not “hurt preexisting conditions,” which must have come as a relief to her sarcoidosis.\\nHow would he protect people with preexisting conditions?\\n“What we’re doing is, we’re going to be doing a health care plan. Preexisting — protecting people with preexisting conditions. As an example, yourself. It sounds like that’s exactly perfect. That’s exactly what we’re talking about. We’re going to be doing a health care plan very strongly and protect people with preexisting conditions.”\\nIt would be inaccurate to describe that as word salad. Salads are good for your health.\\nCampaigns are not about plans. They’re about connecting with voters, which Trump so far has failed to do. He has no health care plan and no empathy. Rather than feeling your pain, Trump wants you to feel his.\\nHe blamed China for the pandemic and Democrats for everything else. After lambasting “Democrat-run cities,” he called himself “the president of everybody.” He sounded like the president of nobody.\\n“We are run by a group of incompetent people, and they are destroying our country,” Trump\\xa0said\\xa0in 2015. He spoke five years too soon.\\nAmerica is in worse shape now than it was when Trump said it was in the worst shape it had ever been. The unemployment rate is\\xa08.4%. It was\\xa04.7% when Trump took office in January 2017. Also, nearly 198,000 Americans have died from COVID. Unsurprisingly, the United States is less respected in much of\\xa0abroad than it has ever been, according to a new\\xa0Pew survey.\\nThe Backstory:What our health journalists want you to know about the coronavirus vaccine\\nDefending his record, Trump said, “I get things done like nobody’s ever gotten.” He argued that some people “are doing better than they were doing before the pandemic came,” which is true. Technically, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are people.\\nOn the pandemic, Trump said he’s done “a tremendous job” and complained that people weren’t giving him more credit. Trump said that if it hadn’t been for him, there would be two million deaths instead of nearly 200,000. He blamed the deaths not on the virus but on tests of the virus. “If we wouldn’t do testing,” he said, “you wouldn’t have cases.” Presumably this is how Trump never contracted STDs.\\n“We’ve done a really good job, and we didn’t mislead anybody,” the president said, intending to mislead everybody.\\nAsked why he downplayed the coronavirus in February and March, the Misleader of the People said he “up-played it.” And also that he downplayed it. “I don’t want to scare people. I don’t want to make people panic,” said the same president who\\xa0warned\\xa0that Biden will “let terrorists roam free” and “abolish the American way of life.”\\nHe also said, four times, that the coronavirus is “going to disappear.” Referring to no evidence whatsoever, he added, “Without a vaccine it will go away quickly.”\\nWith any luck, so will he.\\nWindsor Mann, a member of USA TODAY’s Board of Contributors, is the editor of “The Quotable Hitchens: From Alcohol to Zionism” and a senior adviser to the Lincoln Project.

The ruling enabled\\xa0states with a history of voter discrimination to escape\\xa0Justice Department oversight.\\xa0\\n“It is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm,” Ginsburg wrote, “because you are not getting wet.”\\nAmericans are throwing away their right to vote, even as the country drowns in political\\xa0polarization. The fight over her Supreme Court seat\\xa0notwithstanding, if there is\\xa0one way to honor Ginsburg — a woman who stood\\xa0tall for Americans' freedoms even as she experienced\\xa0significant personal health crises — it is simply to vote.\\nAfter all, this Election Day will be framed in the history of a global pandemic. And there have been significant challenges to voting because of\\xa0COVID-19.

Another avenue\\xa0disappeared for months when departments of motor vehicles closed, thwarting\\xa0those who would have been\\xa0prompted to register to vote while registering a vehicle or renewing a driver’s license.\\nBut not all is lost. Social media has proved\\xa0to serve as a strong arm in voter engagement, particularly reaching those under 30. Last week, Snapchat reported\\xa0that more than 400,000 people had used the platform to\\xa0register to vote. And Foot Locker has partnered with Rock the Vote in transforming more than 2,000 retail locations into voting registration sites in an effort to encourage\\xa0turnout among\\xa0the more than 4 million young people eligible to cast ballots\\xa0for the first time.\\xa0You\\xa0might chuckle at the idea, but I believe\\xa0it's crucial to reach would-be voters where they are\\xa0— including\\xa0our\\xa0filter-loving or sneaker-loving youth.\\nBecause this is an election year like no other.\\xa0For the past six months, it has been difficult to focus on little more than the novel coronavirus and the civil unrest in many American cities. But we can't afford to lose sight of the many other pressing issues and policies we must reckon with as a country: immigration, climate change, systemic racism, income inequality and\\xa0health care. With each, we must ask ourselves who we believe\\xa0is best suited to serve as commander in chief for the next four years.\\xa0\\nUltimately, you must decide\\xa0which candidate best aligns with your values and political ideology.

Those\\xa0documents echoed some of what Wolf said in his testimony.\\xa0\\nWolf additionally\\xa0told senators the country faces threats of election interference from Russia, China and Iran. He stated\\xa0“Russia looks to denigrate former Vice President Biden” while China and Iran prefer Biden, Trump\\'s Democratic opponent, but\\xa0said there’s no current intelligence proving that any of those countries have yet carried out attacks.\\nSimilarly, in congressional testimony last week, FBI Director Christopher\\xa0Wray said that,\\xa0as in 2016, Russia\\xa0remains \"very active\" in efforts to \"influence our election,\" in this case by denigrating Biden.\\nMore:Trump said he \\'did not like\\' FBI Director Wray\\'s testimony on Russia election meddling\\n“I did not like his answers yesterday,\" Trump told reporters in response to Wray. He later tweeted that China \"is a FAR greater threat than Russia, Russia, Russia.\"\\nWolf also\\xa0rejected a separate allegation that he held back an intelligence report on Russian disinformation that targeted Biden regarding his mental health.\\nWolf said he put a hold on the two-page document in July so that it could be “improved” with additional context.

To her, they aren\\'t for the news media or the candidates.\\xa0\\nBy that standard, last week\\'s presidential debate didn\\'t make for a particularly good viewing experience.\\xa0\\nPage, USA TODAY\\'s\\xa0Washington Bureau chief, presided\\xa0over Wednesday\\'s vice presidential debate between Mike Pence and Kamala Harris in Salt Lake City. Leading up to the debate, Page said she sought ways to create a different kind of conversation.\\xa0\\nThat\\xa0task required a more aggressive moderation than she\\'d planned to allow equal speaking time for both candidates, and she had to cut a planned segment on immigration.\\nStill, Page was hopeful the debate was useful for voters.\\n\"I didn\\'t get answers to all the questions I had hoped to get,\" she told USA TODAY Editor-In-Chief Nicole Carroll\\xa0after the debate. \"I think sometimes I got prepared speeches instead of spontaneous responses —\\xa0that shouldn\\'t be a surprise.\"\\nSusan Page, in her own words:Page explains her \"Thank you, Vice President Pence\" approach and more\\nPence repeatedly talked over Page, raising the question\\xa0of whether the vice president would have treated a male moderator the same way. Page noted that Pence\\xa0participated in the vice presidential debate four years ago with a woman moderator – and talked over her as well.\\n\"I don\\'t know that I\\'ve seen him in that kind of setting with a male moderator,\" Page said.\\nAn analysis from CNN reported Harris and Pence were given nearly identical speaking time, with the Democratic senator from California clocking in at 36 minutes and 24 seconds and the Republican vice president speaking for just three seconds more.\\xa0\\nPage was watching the time: She had clocks on her desk to show both candidates\\' speaking time.\\xa0Her final tally: Harris had 30 more seconds to speak than Pence.\\xa0\\n\\'I\\'m speaking\\' vs. \\'If I may finish:\\'\\xa0Pence, Harris spar over COVID-19 and other top moments from the VP debate\\n\"Early on, it was clear it required more aggressive moderation than I had planned to keep it about equal,\" she said.\\xa0\\nBy the hour mark, it was obvious the debate was running over its allotted 90 minutes, said Page, the first print reporter selected by the Commission on Presidential Debates as a solo moderator.\\nWhile the vice presidential debate was more civil than last week\\'s Donald Trump-Joe Biden presidential debate, interruptions from both sides were common, with Harris turning to Pence twice to tell the vice president she was still speaking as he tried to talk over her.\\nUSA TODAY Editorial Board:Kamala Harris and Mike Pence clash, but in a civilized way\\nCBS News reported Pence interrupted Harris 10 times, compared to five interruptions from Harris.\\xa0\\nPence also frequently spoke over Page as she tried to tell him his time was up.\\xa0\\n\"I felt the only thing I could do was interject his time was up,\" Page said.\\nAnd, no, she said she didn\\'t want a way to cut his microphone.\\xa0\\nShe added,\\xa0\"We set these rules so that the candidates can have a chance to speak. It\\'s not my debate. It\\'s their debate. It\\'s the voters\\'\\xa0debate.\"\\nBoth candidates also dodged direct questions, at times. Page\\'s job was not to ask follow-up questions or hold the candidates feet to the fire, she said. The debate isn\\'t an interview or a news conference, where she normally would have followed up, she\\xa0said.\\xa0\\nNeither candidate answered a question about presidential disability, for example.\\xa0\\n\"Everything about a debate tells voters something,\" she said. \"So, with both candidates, and especially with Vice President Pence, they didn\\'t address the question I asked. That is frustrating to me because I spent a lot of time writing those questions. But, that is illuminating in its\\xa0own way to voters, and that was the point.\"\\xa0\\nCoronavirus\\xa0was always going to be her first topic, she said. The two campaigns met and decided Harris would be the first person to answer, she said. Page drafted narrow questions, ones she thought would resonate with voters,\\xa0in the hopes of getting direct answers.\\xa0\\n\"This was perhaps less successful than I\\'d hoped,\" she said after the debate.\\xa0\\n\\'I\\'m speaking\\':Harris, Pence clash evident at vice presidential debate even with body language\\nPart of Page\\'s preparation included a mock debate with \"extremely rude\" debaters, she said.\\xa0\\nShe implemented a key portion of the mock debate training when she had to rein in both candidates who were interrupting each other during a conversation about the military. She aggressively reminded the candidates of the rules they\\'d agree to and let them know it was time to get back on track.\\xa0\\nPage did that once on Wednesday. In her mock debates, she did it \"like three times.\"\\xa0\\n\"As we worked through the mock debate, I became more and more aggressive in trying to shut it down because nothing else was working,\" Page said.\\xa0\\nPage said she was honored to be the moderator for Wednesday\\'s debate.\\xa0\\n\"I hope that voters who watched it thought it helped them decide who has the policies they support,\" she said. \"Who has the leadership characteristics that they want to see. I hope it helped voters. That\\'s what I hope. So, you tell me if it was successful.\"\\nContributing:\\xa0Rebecca Morin, Jeanine Santucci and Erin Jensen, USA TODAY\\n'},\n",

Monday night, he rolled through several staples: \"So Hott,\" \"Cowboy,\" All Summer Long,\" \"Born Free.\"\\nIt came hours after Rock issued a news-filled post on social media: Notably, he announced he’s planning “one last monster tour” —\\xa0possibly in 2021 —\\xa0along with the release of new music.\\nHe also revealed he has been battling with neck issues “for years,” attributing it to his three decades onstage. He wrote that he’d gotten a pair of steroid shots Monday morning —\\xa0one in his neck, one in his butt.\\n“Would make sense to cancel my appearance, but NO WAY!” he wrote. “I will be there and give it everything I have this evening.”\\nIn the hours ahead of the event, the grounds outside the marina teemed with American flags, MAGA memorabilia, classic-rock songs and “U-S-A” chants. At least one attendee hoisted the Confederate stars-and-bars, emblazoned with “REDNECK.”\\nRock, 49, is a longtime Donald Trump proponent: He endorsed the Republican nominee in 2016, and has since dined and golfed with the president.\\nGet ready:Register to vote or check your status here\\nRock made his own political waves in 2017, when he staged a mock Senate run that unfolded over several months. His views —\\xa0including attacks on Colin Kaepernick and others kneeling for the national anthem —\\xa0have stirred controversy and divided his longtime fan base.\\nHis increasingly vocal right-leaning stances have also eroded his support in the city of Detroit, where earlier in his career he was largely warmly received. His Little Caesars Arena shows in 2017 were picketed by protesters. Following a November rant by Rock blasting Oprah Winfrey, arena officials announced they would not renew a licensing deal for a venue restaurant using his name.\\nKid Rock, who owns the Made in Detroit merchandise line,\\xa0posted a fiery response\\xa0at the time, citing his record of philanthropy in the city and sounding exasperated by the backlash.\\nStill firmly aboard was John Larue, 33, of Chesterfield, Michigan, who attended Monday’s rally eager to experience live music after a lengthy pandemic dry spell. While he was happy to show support for Trump and company, Kid Rock was the big draw for Larue, who hadn’t attended a concert since a November show by rock band Tool.\\n“We’ve been without music for so long,” he said. “So this is very cool.”\\nContact Detroit Free Press music writer Brian McCollum: 313-223-4450 or bmccollum@freepress.com.\\n'},\n",

She said she won\\'t vote for Trump this year, but the\\xa0retired Air Force veteran isn\\'t sure if she\\'ll pull the lever for Biden.\\nAre the polls wrong?\\xa0Polls show Trump is losing to Joe Biden. They said the same thing 4 years ago against Hillary Clinton\\n\"The problem that I’m having is that I feel like both parties right now are being spoiled teenagers,\" Mercer said. \"And it’s very hard for me to vote with a conscience for either side when it doesn’t feel like they’re working for the people.\"\\nPolls show Biden maintaining a roughly 7-point lead nationally over Trump, according to the Real Clear Politics average. But the lead has narrowed, even more so in the swing states including Pennsylvania that are expected to decide the presidency. That means both campaigns have a lot riding on voters like Mercer who have yet to make up their minds.\\nLike several undecided voters USA TODAY interviewed, Mercer said she wants to see the upcoming debates\\xa0– three presidential and one vice presidential\\xa0– before making up her mind.\\nRepublican Vincent Ballantoni, 58,\\xa0lives in Clearwater, Florida, and\\xa0voted for Obama in 2012. But he\\xa0went for Trump four years ago because he viewed the\\xa0real estate mogul\\xa0as someone who represented \"new blood\" and who would fight for Americans still struggling economically.\\n\"I figured, \\'Oh he\\'ll come in and shake it up a little bit and turn the world upside down\\' because if you watch \\'The Apprentice\\' that\\'s what he has the tendency to do,\"\\xa0Ballantoni said. \"He doesn\\'t take slack from anybody. Unfortunately, I wish he\\'d get off Twitter.\"\\nAfter four years of Trump\\'s presidency, Ballantoni said he remains undecided about this election and is torn between his\\xa0distaste for the president\\'s bombastic style and anxiety about the rising voices on the Democratic side, such as liberal firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\\n\"I think Biden has his heart is in the right spot but he\\'s too soft and is going to get pushed,\" he said. \"I think Trump has his heart in the right spot, but\\xa0he needs to realize he needs to tone down this stuff and don\\'t just go off to the right and spout off stuff that isn\\'t\\xa0true.\"\\nAnnie Thieman, 36, an independent from the Pittsburgh suburb of South Fayette, is also uncertain. The\\xa0catering manager backed Trump in 2016, after voting for Obama in 2008 and 2012.\\nShe likes Trump\\'s policies on the economy, prescription drug pricing and tax cuts but is bothered by the president\\'s personality and penchant for diving into unnecessary fights.\\nWhere do Americans stand on election issues? Let them tell you how they feel about this policy\\nThieman\\xa0calls the president \"arrogant,\" \"conceited,\" and \"selfish\" but Biden\\'s nearly 50 years in public office has her worried he might not be willing to embrace a new approach to tackle the country\\'s long-term problems. Most of all, she can\\'t stand the bickering.\\n“I’m frustrated that we’re not getting true answers,\" Thieman said. \"As a voter, I pride myself on trying to make educated decisions as much as I can. And I can’t with good conscience say that I have an educated enough decision to vote either way. You constantly have to filter through the fighting to hear what they’re actually trying to say.”\\n\"Lesser of two evils\" is a phrase used by many voters, especially the shrinking\\xa0band of undecided ones.\\nDemocrat Heather Maluke, 41, a cleaner from Mogadore, Ohio, near Akron supported progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in the primary. Now, she\\'s holding her nose\\xa0– again.\\nTrump makes her \"angry\" whereas\\xa0Biden comes off as \"creepy,\" she said.\\xa0In 2016, she wrote in Sanders\\'\\xa0name because neither Trump nor Clinton inspired her. She\\'s considering doing that again.\\n\"Here we go again. So this time, I\\'m going to pencil in Mickey Mouse or something,\" Maluke said with a chuckle.\\nJust\\xa08% of registered voters agreed with the statement that\\xa0their choice for president this fall will be difficult \"because\\xa0either\\xa0one would make a good president,\"\\xa0according to an August poll by the\\xa0Pew Research Center.\\nThat is the lowest response to that question the organization has received since it first began asking back in 2000. About 11% said the same thing during the matchup\\xa0between Clinton and Trump, which polls identified as the two most unpopular presidential nominees in history.\\nAnd voters have fewer legitimate choices\\xa0this time compared to four years ago.\\nMore:Joe Biden outraises President Donald Trump by more than $150M in August\\nFormer GOP New Mexico\\xa0Gov.

Convincing them to actually cast a ballot\\xa0– in person or by mail\\xa0– remains a challenge in a country where about 61% of the voting-age population turns out to vote in a typical election without a pandemic.\\nMelissa Michelson, a political scientist at Menlo College and co-author of the 2012 book, \"Mobilizing Inclusion: Transforming the Electorate Through Get-out-the-Vote Campaigns,\" said\\xa0undecided voters often respond to a more subtle or specific type of messaging on topics they care about.\\nShe said research shows\\xa0political campaigns have learned to approach those voters by emphasizing an issue or group they care about such as gun rights or immigration.\\n\"You might think of yourself as undecided, but maybe you\\'re very concerned about health care and then they\\'re\\xa0going to reach out to you with information on where\\xa0the candidates stand on the health care,\" Michelson said.\\xa0\"They want to guide you toward deciding for yourself that you support one or the other candidates based on what they\\'ve done on that issue.\"\\nRegister to Vote in 2020 Elections | USA TODAY\\nMichelson said undecided voters are\\xa0especially resistant to campaign messaging\\xa0that feels like persuasion.

In 2016, the historic unpopularity of Trump and Clinton had many hemming and hawing up to the\\xa0end.\\xa0Ultimately, that group swung heavily for Trump.\\nIn a Monmouth University poll in early September, 81% of voters nationally said they had\\xa0made a choice in the presidential race and were\\xa0certain about it. Another 11% have picked a candidate but could still change their mind. And 8% were undecided.\\nFour years ago in late August, the survey\\xa0found that 66% were sure about who they were backing, 16% were leaning toward a candidate but not locked in, and\\xa018% were undecided.\\nThere\\'s also widespread anxiety about whether to trust the election results.\\nA Monmouth University poll released Thursday found that about 4\\xa0in 10 voters are not confident that the election will be conducted \"fairly and accurately.\"\\nThe poll also finds that most voters – 52% – thought the Trump campaign would\\xa0try to cheat if necessary to win in November while 39%\\xa0say the same about the Biden campaign.\\nTrump\\'s frequent but unsubstantiated claim that mail-in voting is riddled with fraud and can\\'t be trusted has fed into voter concerns.\\n“We have voters on both sides who are becoming more inclined to distrust a result they won’t agree with,\" said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.\\nMeanwhile, undecided swing-state voters like\\xa0Ballantoni from Florida\\xa0and Thieman from Pennsylvania hope the debates will quell the anxiety of the election a bit and offer some guidance.\\n“Hopefully, we\\'ll\\xa0hear more about what they actually plan on doing,\" she said. \"And less about how much they hate each other.\"\\n'},\n",

Trump’s appointments in May and August created a four-four split between conservatives and liberals. A move to release the voting-rights report failed in a tie.\\nConservative lawyer J. Christian Adams, who\\xa0was appointed to the commission two weeks before the meeting, said in an email that he voted against releasing the report because it\\xa0“overlooked the disenfranchising effect of mail voting,” such as\\xa0ballots that are undeliverable, rejected, or lost.

It solicited comments from voting rights groups and experts, as well as advocates for individuals with disabilities and those with limited English language skills. More than a dozen submitted nearly 300 pages of writtentestimony.\\xa0\\nThey recounted problems with primary elections in Georgia, Wisconsin, Nevada, Ohio, Kentucky and other states as the coronavirus spread across the country. They said there were shortages of protective gear for poll workers, many of whom are elderly, putting them and voters at risk. There were steep reductions in the number of polling places, which caused long lines. At a polling place in Nevada, the last voter didn’t cast\\xa0a ballot until after 3 a.m.\\nThe American Civil Liberties Union\\xa0noted that Black voters have historically relied more\\xa0on in-person voting, so they\\'re more at risk of getting sick and more affected by problems at polling places.\\xa0People with disabilities or limited language skills often rely on assistance at the polls to cast ballots.\\nAnd requirements in some states that people have mail-in ballots witnessed or notarized could expose voters who live alone to the virus. More than 34 million voters live alone, including 13 million over 65, the group said.\\nThe testimony was uploaded to a file-sharing service,\\xa0and the commission shared a link in an August press release\\xa0marking the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. It said the commission is “continuing its enduring commitment to voting rights by issuing a new report this fall, Navigating Voting During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Considerations in Access for Minority Voters.”\\nBut on Aug. 21, the commissioners voted against releasing the report and supporting documents.\\nA Democratic commissioner\\xa0remarked during the meeting that the decisions\\xa0could damage the storied body for years to come.\\xa0\\n“To simply bury it as if it never occurred\\xa0is contrary to transparency; it\\'s contrary to what we have done in the past; contrary to just the spirit of open debate and discussion,” said Michael Yaki, a commissioner since 2005.\\nHe told USA TODAY in an interview afterward that he found it “ridiculous” and “shortsighted.”\\nThe commission was set up under the Civil Rights Act of 1957 to conduct investigations and make recommendations for national civil rights policy and to monitor enforcement of federal civil rights laws. Its work informed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Age Discrimination Act of 1978 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\\nBut the agency\\xa0hasn’t been insulated from\\xa0political maneuvering and strife. Its focus\\xa0has veered from one side of the political spectrum to the other\\xa0depending on who occupied the White House.\\xa0Trump’s appointments simply mark the latest shift, experts say.\\n“It’s a shame, it’s a crying shame,” said Mary Frances Berry, a constitutional scholar and civil rights activist who was a member of the commission for 24 years and served as chair for 11 before she left in 2004.\\nCommissioners serve six-year terms. Four are appointed by the president, two by the Speaker of the House and two by the president pro tempore of the Senate. They can be removed only for cause. No more than half can be from the same political party.\\nDuring the George W. Bush administration, two Republican members registered as independents, circumventing that requirement and creating a conservative majority, according to The Boston Globe.\\nThe commission went on to question school desegregation efforts and affirmative action programs, and, after Obama took office, the Justice Department’s handling of a case of alleged white voter intimidation by members of the New Black Panther Party. A conservative commissioner at the time, Abigail Thernstrom, dismissed the Black Panther inquiry, telling Politico in 2010 it was driven by partisan “fantasies.”\\nObama replaced commissioners as their terms expired, creating a liberal-minded majority with two independents. But like the independents appointed by Bush,\\xa0their political leanings aren\\'t hard to discern. One was on the\\xa0Democratic Party\\'s platform committee in 2016; the other is running for Congress in North Carolina as a Democrat.\\nIn the final days of his administration, Obama installed Democrats Lhamon and Debo Adegbile, a lawyer who had failed to win Senate confirmation to lead the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division in 2014.\\xa0\\nSince then, the commission has issued scathing reports on the Trump administration’s immigration policies and its\\xa0civil rights record. It has voiced\\xa0concerns about Trump\\'s executive orders restricting immigration\\xa0from countries with significant Muslim populations\\xa0and his characterization of coronavirus as the “Chinese virus.”\\nWhen Trump appointed Adams in August, longtime conservative commissioner Peter Kirsanow welcomed the arrival of “the Cavalry” in a National Review column, saying conservatives on the commission had been at the mercy of a 6-2 liberal\\xa0majority for seven years.\\nKirsanow, a Cleveland lawyer first appointed to the commission by George W. Bush in 2001, did not return messages seeking comment. Nor did Gail Heriot, a conservative\\xa0University of San Diego law school professor first appointed in 2007.\\nGilchrist, the Trump appointee seated in May, said he looks forward to helping forge “more of a balanced approach to issues in this country as it relates to civil rights.”\\nAdams said he hopes to raise issues\\xa0“that are meaningful to real people, not to academics or the elites.”\\nHe said “government edicts” prevent people from working, church worship has been curtailed, and people are being attacked\\xa0for speaking their minds. “These are threats very different from 60 years ago, but the Commission has a role in addressing them,” Adams said.\\xa0\\nBerry, the scholar and 24-year veteran of the commission, said she believes it has lost its moral authority as partisanship – on both sides – has undercut its credibility.\\xa0\\n“It\\'s been lost now for a number of years,” she said.\\nBerry, who authored a 2009 book about the commission called “And Justice for All,\"\\xa0said the commission should be scrapped. She said it should be\\xa0replaced with a six-member “human rights” panel of presidential appointees, evenly divided by party and\\xa0confirmed by the Senate. Under the current system, appointees do not face Senate confirmation.\\n“The main problem is a structural issue … which you can see right before your\\xa0eyes,” Berry said. \"That\\'s no way to run a railroad.\"\\nYaki, the longtime Democratic commissioner, said the commission is going to have to work differently “if we’re going to be productive at all.” And that includes conservatives.\\n“If these folks want to have any voice at all of their views, no matter how skewed and wrong they are, they\\'re going\\xa0to have to figure out a way to work with us and work together if important information is going to come to light at the commission,” he said. “Otherwise, we\\'re going to have hearings occur in a vacuum. They occur and then they go into a black box.”\\n'},\n",

He wakes up at 5:30 a.m. — a habit that hasn\\'t left him since his days as a tank mechanic — and sits in a brown recliner across from its now-empty pair in the sun room. He sips weak coffee from a brown and tan ceramic Fort Scott\\xa0mug decorated with a sprig of wheat and foregoes breakfast altogether, as there\\'s no longer anyone to share it with.\\nDancing along the wallpaper’s top trimming are cardinals, Virginia\\'s favorite bird. A wall of windows looks out onto a small backyard with enough room for a birdbath, a red and gold birdhouse on a wooden platform and two double-crook black metal stands that hold four bird feeders.\\n\"My wife always said that if we were going to go to a nursing home, it would have to have a sun room like this so we could sit and watch the birds,\" Soyez, 86, said.\\nOften referred to as the nation\\'s breadbasket, Kansas once captured the national imagination as the \"land of Oz.\" Now, due to severe global changes in climate, some of the essential symbols that distinguish it from the rest of the country are being threatened: Wheat and other crops struggle to withstand the rising heat; the Flint Hills, which houses most of the last of the nation\\'s\\xa0tallgrass prairie (less than 4% of the original prairie remains), is vulnerable. And, more than 52 species of birds, including the western meadowlark, the state bird, are at risk of losing their range within the state.\\nReport for America:When COVID-19 forced schools to close, child hunger surged in West Virginia\\nAs raging wildfires devastate California and rising tides contribute to coastal flooding, Kansas is not typically at the forefront of the national climate change discussion. While 67% of Kansans agree that climate change is happening, only 52% believe it’s mostly caused by human activity, according to a survey by Yale Climate Change Communications.\\xa0That puts Kansas below the national average on both beliefs, though signs of a shift are emerging.\\n\"I\\'ve noticed a change,\" said Bill Wentz, a professor of aerospace engineering who teaches sustainable energy at Wichita State University. \"College students still want to argue about what’s really happening with climate change, but most people acknowledge that it is happening.\"\\nThough not professional birders, the Soyezes tracked changes in the bird population from their yard. In her last years, Virginia was increasingly concerned by the dramatic decline they noticed; some of her favorite birds, like the redheaded woodpecker, didn\\'t seem to return as often. Other birds, like the white-winged dove, which was once only seen as far north as Texas, began to visit more regularly as the climate warmed.\\nThe redheaded woodpecker is one of 52 species most vulnerable to Kansas’ spring heat waves, which endanger their young and contribute to the loss of their habitat. A\\xa0recent study by the National Audubon Society also considered how devastation is exacerbated by urbanization and increased wildfires.\\xa0In Sedgwick County, where Soyez lives, it is one of four birds at high risk because of climate change, and he rarely sees them. It took a long time to understand why.\\nAccording to the American Wind Energy Association, 41% of Kansas’ generated electricity in 2019 was from wind, the second highest percentage in the nation, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 8.2 million metric tons. Renewable energy investment, according to a spokesperson of Gov. Laura Kelly, is both an economic and environmental imperative.\\xa0The administration has balanced encouraging Kansas’ wind development while still protecting key ecosystems from being developed despite their wind potential, such as the Flint Hills.\\xa0\\nThe Kelly administration is working with stakeholders and state agencies on a renewable energy vision for Kansas,\\xa0the spokesperson said.\\nBut as rising heat, droughts and increased flooding are noticeably impacting local neighborhoods, advocates are worried that Kansas isn’t doing enough to protect citizens from climate change. Unlike 32 other states, Kansas doesn’t have a climate action plan. Significantly, the state also doesn’t have a planning department, meaning that as new construction projects are being developed there are few considerations of how to reduce and mitigate the future impact of climate change, like reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing shelter for weather disasters.\\nReport for America:Undocumented in Pennsylvania: An immigration activist stays defiant despite Trump policies\\n\"In Kansas, we tend to be pretty hands off and certainly at the state level there\\'s not really strong laws or guidance,\" said Ward Lyles, a licensed urban planner and associate professor of public affairs and administration at the University of Kansas. “And that’s true across the Midwest.”\\nWhile there is no one alive today who could remember what pre-industrial Kansas felt like, or saw the tallgrass prairie flourishing, Soyez is part of a generation that witnessed the signs of climate change during their lifetime. A former gas plant worker who has lived in Kansas his entire life, Soyez didn’t know how climate change was affecting his home until recently. Though he didn’t have a term for it, he witnessed its impact over the course of his life, remembering when he used to hunt and drink straight out of local springs. Now, he wouldn’t dare.\\n\"I wouldn\\'t drink that water any more than a man on the moon,\" Soyez said. \"I won\\'t eat the fish I catch around here. I\\'d eat a fish out of the salt water down there, but the fish that I catch here? No.\"\\nPerhaps most regrettably, he didn\\'t know how the birds were being affected by climate change until after Virginia’s death, when he read a Wichita Eagle story about Kansas birds: “Birds in Kansas are facing major threats to their survival and without fast action, the state will lose significant numbers and even entire species, researchers say.”\\nThe stark warning still stings. His deep, gravelly voice skips from tale to tale like a stone thrown across a pond, leaving lasting ripples behind as he confronts his grief, and the regret that he couldn’t provide this last answer to his wife.\\nBut hours of video footage, of birds flitting from feeder to feeder and the faint humming sound of a happy Virginia in the background, remind him that through 66 years of marriage their passion never ceased. And he promised to protect it.\\nSarah Spicer covers climate change for The Wichita Eagle.

       "  'body': \"FRESNO, Calif. —\\xa0At 9 p.m. in late August the Fresno Police Reform Commission was four hours into its fourth general meeting when members began to debate whether school resource officers should wear polos instead of uniforms.\\n“We would like them to be in street clothes or their police polos, shorts, jeans. We don't want them walking around in their combat uniform,” said Keshia Thomas, president of the Fresno Unified School District and one of the 37\\xa0members of the commission.\\nThe debate over what police officers should wear in schools was among the more contentious topics. Discussions about the lack of diversity among Fresno PD officers,\\xa0that police officers should not answer mental health calls and qualified immunity should end reached consensus.\\nThe commission was established after Miguel Arias, Fresno City Council president, requested it in response to the local march of more than 3,000 Fresnans in a Black Lives Matter protest following the death of George Floyd, who was killed in Minneapolis police custody in May.\\n“We felt it was important to actually follow through with a body of work that would improve policing in our city,” Arias said, recalling multiple cases involving the use of excessive force by police, resulting in deaths and which cost the city millions of dollars in settlements.\\nAn analysis of officer-involved shootings in Fresno by the American Civil Liberties Union found significant racial differences in the number of local shootings. From 2006 to 2016, the Hispanic population represented 44% of the population and 58% of officer-involved shootings, while Black residents represented 8% of the city’s population but 22% of officer-involved shootings in that same period.\\xa0By comparison, white residents, who comprised 29% of the population at the time, accounted for just 8% of officer-involved shootings.\\xa0\\nThe report also revealed that the largest percentage of officer-involved shootings occurred in south Fresno, an overwhelmingly Black, Latino and low-income part of the city.\\n“People in south Fresno have been over-policed, over-criminalized, and don't have the same relationship and the same lived experience when it comes to public safety,” said Arias.\\nReport for America:Undocumented in Pennsylvania: An immigration activist stays defiant despite Trump policies\\nIn 2017, Sgt. Ray Villalvazo shot 16-year-old Isiah Murrietta-Golding in the back of the head as Murrietta-Golding ran away from officers; video of the teen’s death galvanized the community. Even as residents and activists continue to demand charges be brought against Villalvazo, local protests after the death of George Floyd compelled the city’s leadership to form the Police Reform Commission.\\n“You have people there who want to defund a police department. You have the president of the police union who is steadfast in his support for his officers,” Arias said. He added that the members are “folks who are going to be committed to working through very difficult conversations.”\\nThe diversity of the commission members — divided into four subcommittees: police budget, police tactics, community input and community development — has sometimes resulted in divisions, but Arias said the range of representation, from activists to police officers, was intentional.\\n“The commission's work can only be as good as the commission is reflective of the city,” he said.\\nNow, they’re tasked with evaluating police practices and recommending changes to the city council, which will then consider adopting their suggestions as it begins budget meetings this fall.\\xa0\\nBut the divisive dress code recommendation, put forth by the community development subcommittee, illuminated some of the fundamental challenges the committee faces in finding a consensus.\\n“I don't think that putting police officers in a dress code to make them appear more friendly, when they are literally trained to kill on command, is wise,” said D'Aungillique Jackson, president of the Fresno State NAACP and chair of the community input subcommittee.\\nHer response drew strong criticism from Sgt. Ron Manning, a Fresno police officer and a member of the commission. Manning, 51, was particularly perturbed by Jackson’s claim that school resource officers “terrorize” children.\\nReport for America:Vulnerable Kansas bird populations are a canary in a coal mine for climate change\\n“Telling the people that law enforcement is on campus to frighten students, to terrorize kids,” Manning responded, “I don’t know where that came from. I've never seen it.”\\n“Real life experience;\\xa0it came from real life experience,” Jackson asserted.\\nTheir exchange reflects the tensions of the national conversation around holding police departments to a higher level of scrutiny, discourse marked by mutual distrust and often disparate life experience.\\xa0Attempts to follow-up with Manning were denied by Fresno PD’s public information officer, who referred any questions about the commission to the city council.\\xa0\\n“To be in that commission meeting and to hear so much praise for this department as it stands — not so much praise for what the department could become — it was hard,” Jackson said later. “What we were doing in that moment was not reimagining, we were reestablishing what already exists.”\\nFor members like Jackson, part of that reimagination means removing officers from schools.\\nEarlier forms of the school resource officer existed as early as the 1950s. But since the '90s,\\xa0they've had a growing presence,\\xa0partly due to an increase in federal funding for community policing after Congress passed Title I of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, allocating nearly $9 billion over six years\\xa0for the Community Oriented Policing Services Office to distribute.\\nA 2018 study by the Urban Institute\\xa0found that 68% of American public high school students attend a school with a police officer. The study noted that, “research on the effects of police on student and school outcomes is limited, and the evidence that does exist is mixed.”\\nBut opponents of school resource officers point to the disproportionate rates of policing experienced by brown and Black students. A U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights report from 2014 found that while Black students represented 16% of student enrollment in 2014, they comprised 31% of school-related arrests. White students by comparison represented 51% of enrollment and 39% of arrests.\\nAshley Rojas, executive director of Fresno Barrios Unidos and a member of the community development subcommittee, summarized the dress code recommendation outcome at the meeting: “We certainly didn't have consensus.”\\nAt a more recent Fresno\\xa0Unified School District\\xa0 board meeting, however, 21 out of 23 public comments called for or suggested board members not to renew their school resource officer contract with Fresno PD.\\nFor her part, Jackson says she’d wouldn’t change what she said to Manning, but she would change the way she went about her message because police reform is bigger than individual officers.\\n“He's a phenomenal resource for so many Black youth,” she says. But “he is an individual. (He) is not the issue; it's the system and the way it empowers.”\\nMaría Esquinca covers California’s Central Valley for Radio Bilingüe.

       "  'body': \"Last week I got an email from a Drug Enforcement Administration agent I used to work with when I was a federal prosecutor at the Justice Department.\\xa0He’s a former cop, former military man, and a current Republican with whom innocent discussions have turned into political battles.\\xa0Through the years of investigations, indictments, arrests, and trials, I found him to be a hardworking and honest agent.\\nHe’s been reading my columns and watching news coverage that appears to be perpetually critical of law enforcement.\\xa0He ended his email with this:\\xa0“If you were still a prosecutor, you would defend us.”\\nHe’s right.\\xa0But I don’t need to be a prosecutor to stand up to the police pile-on from many members of my own party, pundits, and the public.\\nFirst, let’s get this out of the way:\\xa0Police misconduct exists. It’s not just a few “bad apples,” and wrongdoing needs to be investigated and prosecuted with the full support of police departments and prosecutors.\\xa0I have personally prosecuted a police officer for misconduct and the only regret I have is that the judge sent him to prison for less time than I sought.\\nThat said, the indiscriminate\\xa0trashing\\xa0of law enforcement is wrong and it needs to stop. If all I knew of cops was the blue knee that spent nine minutes squeezing the life out of George Floyd, or the video images of gratuitous force against those who protested that injustice, I’d hate all cops too.\\xa0But I know more than that.\\nFor 28 years, as both a state and federal prosecutor, I worked with law enforcement officers day in and day out.\\xa0Local cops, FBI, DEA, Secret Service and many others.\\xa0We shared lunches, birthdays, personal losses . . . and a daily effort to make people’s lives better by making them safer.\\xa0\\nAnd so I know the Oakland County Sheriff deputy who never complained as I commandeered his weekends and evenings for more than a year while we prepared a murder trial against a man who hit a woman on the head with a baseball bat and then strangled her to death.\\xa0\\nI know the Los Angeles Police Department detective who, despite threats to his family, worked tirelessly to indict an organized crime leader who was terrorizing people who could not meet his extortion demands.\\xa0\\nAnd I know the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who watched 600 vile child pornography videos, and selected the 20 worst ones, so I only had to run to the restroom and vomit once while we prepared for trial against a pedophile.\\xa0\\nOn Saturday,\\xa0two Los Angeles sheriff's deputies were sitting in their patrol car when someone shot them multiple times. One of them,\\xa0a 31-year-old mother who was bleeding from her face, tied a tourniquet around her 24-year-old partner.\\xa0As the deputies were in surgery, fighting for their lives, a small group of “protesters” blocked the entry to the hospital and laughed as they chanted for the deputies to die.\\nBehind the badge, uniform, and riot gear, there are human beings with the same complexities racists seek to erase when they look at a Black man and think “thug.”\\xa0The problem is that we’ve seen enough viral videos of Black men dying at the hands of police, that our knee jerk reaction to every use of force is a presumption of impropriety. \\xa0\\nWhat\\xa0reform looks like:Why support for criminal justice reform isn't the same as being anti-police\\nThe swinging batons, punches, Tasers, grappling on the ground, and sometimes gunfire makes people recoil.\\xa0It’s tough to watch.\\xa0But violent gang members who climb the chain of command by killing a cop, bullets that pierce bulletproof vests, and criminals with added strength from PCP, methamphetamine, and other stimulants are all 2020 realities faced by police.\\nCops take the risks so we don’t have to.\\xa0The danger they face every day is a heavy weight that makes them squeeze their children a little tighter before heading to work.\\xa0It calibrates how they interact with the public.\\nSo many of the tragedies that injure or kill\\xa0civilians happen when an officer attempts to make an arrest.\\xa0In the middle of a struggle with someone who is resisting arrest, it can be very difficult\\xa0for an officer to calculate exactly enough force, but not an ounce more. And if we use TV Sheriff Andy Griffith’s 1960 Mayberry as the standard of acceptable force, in 2020 South Side Chicago, we guarantee the outrage that inevitably follows expectations that ignore reality.\\nAs stomach-churning as it is to watch a forceful police arrest, the public needs to commit to looking at all the facts and listening to the experts before assuming misconduct and rioting in the streets.\\xa0\\nAnd we need to stop saying “he only stole a can of beer from 7-11 so the cops should not have used force when he resisted arrest.”\\xa0That only works if we, as a society, come to a consensus that anyone can walk into a store and take what he wants, and then avoid arrest by resisting.\\nThe divide between law enforcement and the public has been deepened by President Donald Trump.\\xa0Despite his “law and order” campaign theme, between indictments of his administration and 2016 campaign staff, Trump has regularly undercut the value and credibility of law enforcement agencies.\\nIt’s ironic then that part of the rage directed at police is because they have become a proxy for Trump and an administration that seeks to govern by brute force rather than rule of law.\\xa0When Trump sent unwanted federal agents to squelch local rioting, he saw to that.\\xa0And while most contact people have with law enforcement is with local rather than federal officers, the stench Trump left on all law enforcement has permeated beyond jurisdictional borders.\\nBlack ex-cop: I understand the anger but don't defund police. It could make things worse.\\nMy hope is that in seven\\xa0weeks new leadership at the top will bring the infrastructure opportunities that were promised four years ago but were never delivered —\\xa0starting with a bridge between law enforcement and the public.\\nPeople need the chance to see the police as I have seen them. It’s cops who investigate and arrest murderers, rapists, and child abusers.\\xa0And it’s law enforcement agents who go undercover to foil terrorist plots against Americans so variations of 9/11 are not a monthly occurrence.\\xa0It’s OK\\xa0to condemn police misconduct when it occurs but still voice appreciation for the sacrifices made by dedicated law enforcement officers.\\nIn the financial crisis of 2008, as companies were poised to crash and take the U.S. economy down with them, a government bailout was premised on the acknowledgement that some institutions of American life are “too big to fail.”\\xa0Respect between law enforcement and the public they serve is the tenuous thread that stops us from devolving into anarchy and vigilante justice.\\xa0There is a lot of room for improvement by law enforcement, but rebuilding respect will take an effort from both sides.\\xa0It has to happen.\\xa0The relationship is too important to fail.\\xa0\\nMichael J.

       "  'body': 'WASHINGTON\\xa0– Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\xa0died Friday evening, giving President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans a rare opportunity to solidify conservative control of the court, perhaps for decades to come.\\nGinsburg, 87, and in failing health, had overcome four\\xa0bouts with pancreatic, lung and colon cancer dating back to 1999 but apparently could not beat the most recent spread to her liver. She had announced her latest recurrence in July, again vowing to stay on the court \"as long as I can do the job full steam.\"\\nThe diminutive New York native leaves behind an enormous\\xa0influence on the law as the nation’s preeminent litigator for women’s rights, a federal appeals court judge, a Supreme Court justice for 27 years and, most recently,\\xa0as the leader of the high court’s liberal bloc, where she served as a bulwark against an increasingly conservative majority.\\n\"Our nation mourns the loss of a titan of the law,\" Trump said in a statement. \"Renowned for her brilliant mind and her powerful dissents at the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg demonstrated that one can disagree without being disagreeable toward one’s colleagues or different points of view.\"\\n“Our nation has lost a jurist of historic stature. We at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague,\" Chief Justice John Roberts said. \"Today we mourn, but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her\\xa0– a tireless and resolute champion of justice.”\\nRemembering RBG:Second woman on Supreme Court had been nation\\'s leading litigator for women\\'s rights\\nGinsburg\\'s death\\xa0comes just weeks\\xa0before\\xa0Democrats hope to win the White House and potentially a Senate majority, given Democratic nominee\\xa0Joe Biden\\'s\\xa0lead in the\\xa0polls. But Republicans will hold the Senate at least until Jan. 3, and Trump the presidency at least until Jan. 20, giving them a chance to gain a\\xa06-3 conservative majority on the court.\\nTrump is expected to nominate a replacement as soon as next week, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., immediately vowed to hold a Senate confirmation vote. But it generally takes more than two months to reach that point, which would put Republicans beyond Election Day, when their 53-47 majority is in jeopardy.\\nIf the vote was to happen during the \"lame duck\" session in November or December, the chances for confirmation likely would depend on whether Trump wins reelection and Republicans maintain their Senate majority. They could plow ahead in defeat up until Jan. 3, but if four Senate Republicans desert the cause, they would fall short.\\nNational Public Radio reported that Ginsburg dictated a statement to her granddaughter shortly before her death, in which she said: \"My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.\"\\nDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden agreed. \"There is no doubt ... that the voters should pick the president, and the president should pick the justice for the Senate to consider,\" he said. \"This was the position the Republican Senate took in 2016 when there were almost 10 months to go before the election.\"\\n\\'We\\'d fill it\\':McConnell blocked Obama Supreme Court pick but says he\\'d help Trump fill a vacancy\\nVirtually nothing motivates both sides in America\\'s culture wars more than a Supreme Court vacancy. One that occurs in a presidential election year and gives a conservative president a chance to replace a liberal justice is even more fraught.

Democrats and liberal advocacy groups cried foul at the confirmation of conservative Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch early in 2017. That was nothing compared to the outrage that accompanied Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh\\'s 50-48 confirmation late in\\xa02018, which followed accusations of decades-old sexual assault that Kavanaugh denied.\\nNow Trump will select a third nominee, most likely from a recently expanded list of\\xa0potential justices assembled with the help of conservative groups, including the Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation.\\xa0The president has lauded his two nominees but has been very critical of Chief Justice John Roberts, whose votes with liberals during the past term\\xa0on abortion, LGBTQ rights\\xa0and the DACA immigration program made clear his role as the court\\'s swing vote.\\nMore:Supreme Court Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh display independent streaks\\nAmong those at the top of Trump\\'s list: Amy Coney Barrett, 48, of Indiana, who he nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, and\\xa0Amul Thapar, 51, of Kentucky, a favorite of McConnell\\'s who Trump named to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit.\\xa0\\nOther potential female nominees include Joan Larsen of Michigan, who serves on the 6th Circuit;\\xa0Allison Eid of Colorado, who serves on the 10th Circuit; and Britt Grant of Georgia, who serves on the 11th Circuit.\\nReplacing RBG:Trump\\'s short list begins with these four women (and one man)\\nRepublicans have a 53-seat majority in the Senate,\\xa0giving them the ability to withstand Democratic opposition. The traditional 60-vote requirement\\xa0for high court nominees was abolished\\xa0when Democrats threatened to block Gorsuch’s confirmation, leading McConnell to push through a\\xa0rules change that allows justices to be confirmed with simple majority votes.\\nStill, the upcoming battle over Ginsburg\\'s\\xa0replacement is certain to be intense, with conservative and liberal interest groups poised to spend tens of millions of dollars in advertising and grassroots activity.\\nObama entered the fray Friday night, noting that Ginsburg \"left instructions for how she wanted her legacy to be honored.\"\\n\"Four and a half years ago, when Republicans refused to hold a hearing or an up-or-down vote on Merrick Garland, they invented the principle that the Senate shouldn’t fill an open seat on the Supreme Court before a new president was sworn in,\" he said in a statement.\\n\"A basic principle of the law – and of everyday fairness – is that we apply rules with consistency, and not based on what’s convenient or advantageous in the moment.... As votes are already being cast in this election, Republican senators are now called to apply that standard.\"\\nMuch of the liberals’ effort likely will focus on moderate GOP senators such as Maine’s Susan Collins,\\xa0Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski and Utah\\'s Mitt Romney. The two female senators may\\xa0be wary of\\xa0risking decades-old precedents such as\\xa0Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide in 1973. Romney was the lone Republican to vote in favor of removing Trump from office during this year\\'s Senate impeachment trial.\\nGinsburg etched her name in legal history before President Jimmy Carter named her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1980. She won five of six cases argued at\\xa0the Supreme Court in the mid-1970s that opened doors for women.\\n\"Justice Ginsburg led one of the great lives in the history of American law,\" Attorney General William Barr said. \"She and I did not agree on every issue, but her legal ability, personal integrity, and determination were beyond doubt.\\xa0\\xa0She leaves a towering legacy, and all who seek justice mourn her loss.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhile remaining a reliable stalwart for equal rights in her later years, Ginsburg had trouble commanding majorities on the\\xa0court. As the years passed, she became more vocal in her dissents – delivering five of them from the bench in the 2012 term alone, a record that still stands. The closet in her chambers held a selection of\\xa0her trademark lace jabots, some\\xa0reserved solely for those dissents.\\nWhen the court struck down the crucial section of the Voting Rights Act by a 5-4 vote in June 2013 –\\xa0enabling states with a history of discrimination to escape preemptory Justice Department oversight –\\xa0she likened it to “throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.”\\nIn recent years, she became a folk hero to the left – the subject of the award-winning documentary \"RBG,\" an opera and a\\xa0feature-length film, \"On the Basis of Sex.\" Her praises were sung on the “Ruth Bader GinsBlog” and her initials emblazoned on “Notorious R.B.G.” T-shirts. She took great pride in a bobblehead celebrating the highlights of her career,\\xa0and she helped to assemble a book of her opinions, dissents and writings entitled “My Own Words.”\\nOn the night before her death, Ginsburg in absentia was awarded the Liberty Medal from the National Constitution Center. She was chosen in part because this year is the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which gave women the right to vote.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'WASHINGTON\\xa0– Seizing an opportunity to consolidate conservative control of the Supreme Court, President Donald Trump on Saturday nominated\\xa0federal appeals court Judge Amy Coney Barrett\\xa0of Indiana to\\xa0replace the late Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\\nThe nomination, overwhelmingly popular among conservatives, comes as Trump trails Democratic nominee Joe Biden in most polls and gives him a chance\\xa0to change the national conversation from the coronavirus pandemic, racial justice and a troubled economy.\\nIn a 20-minute Rose Garden ceremony, Trump called Barrett\\xa0“one of our nation’s most brilliant and gifted legal minds\" and virtually dared Democrats to try delaying or blocking her confirmation.\\n\"Her qualifications are unsurpassed, and her record is beyond reproach. This should be a straightforward and prompt confirmation,\" the president said, adding with a wink, \"I\\'m sure it will be extremely non-controversial.\"\\nBarrett paid homage to Ginsburg despite their ideological differences and acknowledged the challenges that face her, both during the confirmation battle and thereafter.\\n“I have no illusions that the road ahead of me will be easy, either for the short term or the long haul,” she said. But she added: \"I assure you that I will meet the challenge with both humility and courage.”\\nWho is Amy Coney Barrett?:Talented judge, popular professor brings solid conservative credentials\\nWith Election Day 38 days away, Senate Republicans hope to move quickly to confirm Barrett, 48, to a lifetime appointment\\xa0on the high court. Only two of the 53 Republicans, Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, oppose voting before the election.\\nDemocrats and liberal interest groups critical of her positions on abortion, health care and other issues appear powerless to block it.\\xa0Meanwhile, the White House has already set up meetings for Barrett on Capitol Hill, the traditional first step toward Senate confirmation.\\nIf she wins confirmation, Barrett, a devout Catholic,\\xa0would be the fifth woman to serve on the Supreme Court and Trump\\'s third nominee, joining Associate Justices Neil Gorsuch\\xa0and Brett Kavanaugh. The past three presidents, Barack Obama, George W. Bush\\xa0and Bill Clinton, each appointed only\\xa0two justices during their eight years in the White House.\\nBarrett is in many ways the ideological opposite of Ginsburg, the leader of the court\\'s liberal wing who died eight days ago after a lengthy battle with cancer. Barrett was a small child when Ginsburg, as a lawyer,\\xa0was winning a string of Supreme Court cases on behalf of women\\'s rights. Ginsburg went on to serve 40 years as a judge, including 27 on the Supreme Court.\\nAmy Coney Barrett:5 things you need to know about the federal court judge\\nStill, Barrett took time Saturday to laud the justice she would replace as \"a woman of enormous talent and consequence.\"\\n\"She not only broke glass ceilings, she smashed them,\" Barrett said. \"For that, she has won the admiration of women all over the country and indeed all over the world.\"\\xa0\\nTrump and Senate Republican leaders want to confirm Barrett before the election\\xa0–\\xa0in part because of the contested nature of the election itself.\\xa0Earlier this week, Trump said he wanted nine justices on the court to decide\\xa0any legal cases that arise from the voting.\\n\"We may end up in a dispute for a long time because that\\'s the way they want it,\" Trump said Friday in reference to Democrats promoting mail-in voting. \"But we\\'re going to end up winning.\"\\nSen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., said Barrett will offer a “little more conservative backbone in the court” and joked that her nomination was\\xa0“one of the worst-kept secrets.” In fact, she was the only person Trump interviewed for the job.\\nThe nomination of Barrett – who serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, based in Chicago\\xa0–\\xa0will be a major campaign issue, coming just three days before the president\\'s\\xa0first debate with Democratic challenger Joe Biden.\\xa0\\nTrump clearly hopes to use it to his advantage. At his\\xa0Saturday night\\xa0rally near\\xa0Harrisburg, Pa., a giant red-and-white sign was hoisted with the phrase, \"FILL THAT SEAT!\"\\n“This nomination is an attack on our very democracy,\" said Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL\\xa0Pro-Choice America.\\nMore:Ruth Bader Ginsburg makes history as the first woman, Jewish person to lie in state at Capitol ceremony\\nRepublicans and conservative allies applauded Barrett as a strict constructionist\\xa0who will interpret the Constitution and not make law from the bench.\\n\"Judge Barrett has impressed the brightest judicial and legal minds with her profound understanding of the law,\" tweeted Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.\\nConfirming Barrett by Election Day will require an extraordinarily fast\\xa0schedule\\xa0against an historic deadline. It customarily takes about 10 weeks to move from a Supreme Court nomination to Senate confirmation. And no justice has been confirmed later than July of an election year.\\nIn a\\xa0Washington Post-ABC poll earlier this week,\\xa057 percent of Americans said the decision on replacing Ginsburg should await the winner of the presidential election. Only 38 percent said Trump and the current Senate should move ahead.\\nFact check:Ginsburg was confirmed in 42 days. But it wasn\\'t an election year.\\nBut Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, plan to hold hearings on Barrett in October, with a final Senate vote by early November, right ahead of the election.\\nDemocrats have decried that plan as hypocritical, pointing to what happened in the 2016 election year. Then, the Republican Senate blocked President Barack Obama\\'s nominee to the high court after Associate Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, some nine months before Election Day.\\nIf Trump and the Republicans push\\xa0Barrett through,\\xa0Democrats have vowed retaliation should they win control of the Senate in November.\\xa0Their options\\xa0range from ending filibuster rights\\xa0– making it nearly impossible for a Republican minority to block legislation\\xa0– to increasing the number of seats on the Supreme Court to restore ideological balance. They also could move to make Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico states, giving them opportunities to add Democrats to the Senate.\\nA former Scalia law clerk, Barrett checks most if not all conservative legal boxes. She is an originalist and a textualist, meaning she looks to the words of the Constitution and congressional statutes as written. At 48, she could serve on the court for four decades or more.\\nIf confirmed by Election Day, she could be on the high court in time to hear several major cases this fall, including a third major challenge to the Affordable Care Act.\\nTrump considered nominating Barrett to the Supreme Court in 2018 after the retirement of Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy. The president instead went with Kavanaugh, who had a much longer tenure as an appeals court judge. Aides said then that the president was saving Barrett for a future high court opening.\\nBarrett\\'s confirmation would give Republican appointees a 6-3 advantage on the nation\\'s highest court, perhaps locking in conservative dominance for decades on\\xa0issues such as abortion, civil and voting rights, health care, police powers, free speech and government regulations.\\nIn the Supreme Court term that ended in July, Republican appointees held a 5-4 advantage, though Trump and others questioned just how conservative the court was under the leadership of Chief Justice\\xa0John\\xa0Roberts.\\nTrump has criticized\\xa0Roberts\\xa0for occasionally siding with liberal justices, including Ginsburg,\\xa0to forge 5-4 majorities.\\xa0Roberts\\xa0has veered from conservative orthodoxy on abortion, immigration, LGBTQ rights and\\xa0most notably on\\xa0President Barack Obama\\'s health care law, the Affordable Care Act.\\nOn the campaign trail, Trump vowed to nominate more conservative justices, and Barrett\\'s appointment is a fulfillment of that pledge. So, too, are the 53 federal appeals court judges he has named, flipping three circuit courts from having a majority of judges named by Democratic presidents to a majority of judges named by Republican presidents.\\xa0\\nMike Davis, former counsel to Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee who now lobbies for Trump\\'s judicial nominees, heralded Barrett\\'s nomination.\\n“With the appointment of a Justice Barrett as his third Supreme Court pick, President Trump will transform the 5-4 John Roberts court to the 6-3 Clarence Thomas court,\" Davis said.\\nFact check:\\'Kingdom of God\\' comment by\\xa0Amy Coney Barrett lacks context in meme\\nBorn in New Orleans and now a resident of Indiana, Barrett has been a Notre Dame law professor since 2002 and a federal appeals court judge since 2017. She and her husband, Jesse, have seven children, including two adopted from Haiti and one who has Down syndrome.\\nWhile she was the overwhelming favorite for the nomination, Trump and aides said he considered at least four other candidates: federal appeals court judges Barbara Lagoa of Florida, Allison Jones Rushing of North Carolina and Joan Larsen of Michigan, and Kate Comerford\\xa0Todd, a deputy White House counsel.\\nRuth Bader Ginsburg:Justice makes history as the first woman, Jewish person to lie in state at Capitol\\nContributing: Michael Collins\\n'},\n",

The administration also released a list of two dozen officials who deny that Trump made the disparaging remarks.\\n\"I would be willing to swear on anything that I never said that about our fallen heroes,\" Trump has said. \"There is nobody that respects them more.\"\\nBiden took a swipe at Trump by recalling that the most meaningful moments of his service as vice president\\xa0visiting wounded veterans at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and having them volunteer to return to their units, even if they had suffered an amputation.\\n“Does that sound like the heart and grit and patriotism of a sucker or a loser?\" Biden said. \"Sounds like heroism to me. Sounds like what patriotism is all about.\"\\nLater Tuesday, Biden attended\\xa0a Hispanic Heritage Month event in Kissimmee\\xa0at Osceola Heritage Park\\xa0as part of his first visit to the Sunshine State\\xa0as the nominee.\\nBiden, whose support has lagged among Hispanics in the key battleground state,\\xa0told reporters Tuesday that he will have to make the case that Hispanics\\xa0will be much better off without Trump as president.\\n“That case is an easy one. Education, health care, immigration, the whole notion of dealing with COVID in a way that doesn’t so damage the Hispanic community which is hurt very badly, much worse than the Caucasian community,” Biden said. “It’s about talking about jobs, it’s about to be willing to step up and provide opportunities for people.”\\nBiden was introduced by musicians Ricky Martin and Luis Fonsi, and actress Eva Longoria.\\n“The Hispanic vote is critical,” said Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla. “We must elect Joe Biden to president of the United States, to solve the pandemic, to restore the economy and to build back better.”\\nFlorida is one of a half-dozen battleground states where Trump and Biden will compete for the White House. Trump narrowly won his adopted state in 2016 by fewer than 113,000 votes out of 9.5 million cast, and Republicans control the governor’s mansion and both chambers of the legislature.\\nTrump traveled to Jupiter, Florida, on Sept. 8 to sign an extension of the moratorium on coastal drilling around the state.\\nAt the Biden roundtable, retired Air Force Maj.\\xa0Gen.\\xa0Richard \"Beef\" Haddad urged Biden to extend the moratorium on drilling by legislation rather than an executive order that could be reversed. Haddad\\xa0said 20 military bases in Florida rely on test firing ranges in the Gulf of Mexico, which could he hindered through drilling, and that an oil spill could damage the state’s coastline.\\n“Failing to extend the eastern Gulf moratorium will impact military readiness, preparedness and will ultimately threaten our national defense,” Haddad said.\\nBiden said he would extend the moratorium permanently.\\n“I can guarantee you, if I am president there will be no offshore drilling and I extend the moratorium,” Biden said.\\nAt the Hispanic heritage event, Biden said everyone other than Native Americans or people forced here by slavery came by choice, looking for opportunity. Biden’s ancestors fled the Irish famine of the 1840s.\\n“The only thing they had in their pocket was hope,” Biden said.\\nIn a community with a large Puerto Rican population, Biden released a plan for helping the U.S. territory recover from Hurricane Maria. Biden proposed to invest in economic development initiatives, provide debt relief and expand access to education for the island’s 3 million residents. He contrasted his proposals with Trump tossing paper towels at a relief station after the storm.\\n“It was mortifying,” Biden said.\\nBiden said he would work with the territory’s leaders to determine their status. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has warned against elected Biden because Democrats would seek statehood for Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.\\n“I happen to believe statehood,” Biden said. “The people of Puerto Rico must decide.”\\nBiden\\'s running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, campaigned Thursday in Florida with her husband, Doug Emhoff. Harris met in Miami Gardens with Black community leaders to hear about their concerns with the coronavirus pandemic and the economy. Emhoff met with rabbis in Aventura to hear about Jewish issues.\\nBiden said Monday after a climate-change speech in Wilmington, Delaware, that his message for Florida\\xa0is that is \"going to work like the devil\" to make sure he turns out every Latino vote.\\nHis visit comes\\xa0at a time when the Trump campaign is hammering Biden with round-the-clock advertising\\xa0calling him a socialist, pictured side-by-side with former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and former Cuban leader Fidel Castro.\\nBiden leads Trump in an average of Florida polls by 2.2\\xa0percentage points through Sept. 15, according to the tracking site FiveThirtyEight.com. But an\\xa0NBC News/Marist Poll released Sept. 8\\xa0found\\xa0Trump and Biden tied at 48% among\\xa0766 likely voters, with a margin of error of 4.5 percentage points.\\nBiden led\\xa0by three percentage points in a Florida Atlantic University poll released Tuesday, within the poll\\'s margin of error. Biden had been\\xa0up by six points in an FAU poll in May.\\n“Florida continues to be too close to call, but the enthusiasm still favors President Trump, and that could be the difference,” said Kevin Wagner, a political science professor at FAU.\\nLatinos who are key to the Florida vote remain a contested demographic, according to the Marist poll.\\xa0Trump is doing well against Biden among Florida\\'s Latinos – 50% to 46%\\xa0– after trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016 exit polls by 62% to 35%, according to the poll.\\nMany Hispanic voters in Florida\\xa0are of\\xa0Cuban descent, and some may be wary of the push by Biden and former President Barack Obama to normalize diplomatic and trade\\xa0relations with Cuba, something Trump reversed.

       "  'body': 'The man who held the U.S. Senate seat now up for grabs in Arizona shared the spotlight with the candidates vying for it Tuesday night.\\nThe name of the late U.S. Sen. John McCain, whose death left a vacant Senate seat that now-Sen. Martha McSally is running to keep, surfaced multiple times during the evening, most notably at one of the debate\\'s key moments.\\nMark Kelly, the Democratic candidate running against McSally, said that knowing McCain was an honor, and he found it hard to understand why McSally wouldn\\'t speak up to defend him to President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly insulted McCain, even after his death.\\nMcSally countered that she had, both publicly and privately, asked Trump to stop attacking McCain.\\n\"Quite frankly, it pisses me off when he does it,\" McSally said.\\nThe moment was one of several during the debate\\xa0that showcased the two candidates, their differences and how they\\'re campaigning. The event was\\xa0the first\\xa0opportunity Arizona voters have had to compare the candidates side by side.\\nMcSally repeatedly said the race with Kelly would have significant implications, potentially deciding which party controls the Senate next year.\\nThese were the top moments in Tuesday\\'s first debate for the next U.S. senator from Arizona.\\nFor an election to represent Arizona, the debate\\xa0focused a lot on another country: China.\\nIn some sense, McSally\\'s repeated jabs at Kelly over his ties to China and whether he had the strength to stand up to the country, were a campaign mailer come to life.\\nThe McSally campaign and supporting groups have sought\\xa0to tie Kelly to China throughout the election cycle. They have taken hits at him for his work with a company that used\\xa0taxpayer-subsidized seed money and capital funding from a Chinese technology company.\\n\"We need someone who\\'s going to be strong on China,\\xa0not doing business with them,\" McSally said.\\nKelly retorted that he would hold China accountable if elected and that he has seen China as an \"adversary\" for his entire adult life. Both said they saw China as a threat to national security.\\nMcSally referred to Kelly as \"counterfeit Kelly\" throughout the debate, a Trumpian insult meant to convey that Kelly is not honest about his views or what he will do if he takes office.\\nThere\\'s also a website based on the insult, paid for by the McSally campaign.\\nKelly did not engage with the insult and did not respond with any kind of nickname of his own for McSally.\\nMcSally also asked several questions directly to Kelly on particular issues, turning from the camera and addressing him during her time to respond to questions or rebut claims. Kelly responded to some of her questions, often while facing toward the camera, and ignored others.\\nMcSally tried to tie Kelly to the \"radical left\" through the work of Giffords, an advocacy group focused on gun safety measures. But she would not state the name of the organization.\\nKelly pounced on the opening.\\n\"The organization that Sen.\\xa0McSally is referring to is named after my wife, Gabby,\\xa0 Gabby Giffords. It\\'s named Giffords. Gabby was injured, shot in the head, in 2011. The issue of gun violence is personal for Gabby and me,\" Kelly said.\\nAt certain moments, moderators\\xa0pushed for more specific answers than the candidates initially offered.\\nFor Kelly, it was questions over whether he supported ending the filibuster, something Democratic leaders have suggested and which Kelly has yet to weigh in on.\\nHe didn\\'t use the debate stage to share his thoughts on the idea. When pressed, he said he needed to hear from everyday Arizonans first to understand what they thought of it.\\n\"This is something that might not even come up for discussion. And if it does, I\\'ll spend some time thinking about it, and I\\'ll make a decision based on what\\'s right for Arizona,\" he said.\\nFor McSally, questions about her support for Trump lacked clear answers.\\nWhen asked if she was proud of her support for Trump, she answered that she was \"proud to be fighting for Arizona every single day.\"\\nShe would not directly say whether she was proud to support Trump.\\nMcSally accused Kelly of a specific incident involving a handshake, or more precisely, the lack thereof.\\nShe alleged the vice president of the National Border Patrol Council put out his hand to shake Kelly\\'s at an event last year. Kelly refused to do so, the story goes, and said the man was \"one of them,\" seemingly meaning a part of Border Patrol.\\nShe used the incident to attempt to show she was tough on immigration and border control.\\n\"You won\\'t shake their hand, but I have their back,\" she said.\\nArt del Cueto, the man in question, recounted this story on a radio show recently. Del Cueto has campaigned on behalf of Trump.\\nKelly said it didn\\'t happen.\\n\"I will shake anybody\\'s hand any time. ...\\xa0I don\\'t know where Sen. McSally\\xa0gets this stuff from,\" he said.\\nThe incident appears to be a \"he said, he said\" accusation.\\nThroughout the debate, the candidates repeated phrases to drive home how they saw themselves and how they wanted Arizona voters\\xa0to see them.\\nMcSally spoke about her military experience and what they would get if they voted for her.\\n\"I think I\\'ve shot the biggest gun of anybody in Congress,\" she said at one point.\\nAt other times, she said that if Arizonans wanted tax cuts\\xa0or someone to stand up to China, they should vote for her.\\n\"I\\'m your girl,\" she said, more than once.\\nFor Kelly, the repeated line was \"independent leadership,\" perhaps an attempt to court independent voters who both campaigns need to win the election.\\n\"We need independent leadership focused on solving hard problems,\" he said at one point,repeating a common refrain he used throughout the debate.\\nReporters Ronald J. Hansen and Yvonne Wingett Sanchez contributed to this story.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Two new studies published in a scientific journal raise questions about whether transmission of the coronavirus on lengthy commercial airline flights might be more common than earlier thought.\\nOne\\xa0looked at two passengers and two flight attendants on the same 15-hour flight from Boston to Hong Kongwho later tested positive for COVID-19. It was found that the virus\\'s genetic sequence in all four was identical, which the study said \"strongly suggests that the virus can be transmitted during air travel.\"\\nThe other study examined a 10-hour flight from London to Hanoi, Vietnam,\\xa0in which 16 aboard were found to have the virus, 12 of whom were seated in business class within two seats or rows of the only symptomatic person. \"Seating proximity was strongly associated with increased infection risk,\" the study concluded.\\nThe studies, both published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, are significant because travelers have slowly been returning to the air as more has become known about how to avoid contracting COVID-19. Both\\xa0involve\\xa0flights that occurred in March and they don\\'t spell out whether passengers were wearing masks.\\nIs it safe to fly?\\xa0Precautions to take when flying during the coronavirus pandemic\\nAirlines are now requiring all passengers and crew aboard flights\\xa0wear masks. Also, many airlines have been flying their planes at reduced capacity, blocking off middle seats in order to afford more distance between passengers.\\nLess was known about\\xa0how to limit transmission of the coronavirus when the flights studied occurred and before precautions like masks and social distancing were becoming commonplace, at least in the U.S.\\nHappy Thanksgiving:Southwest Airlines will leave middle seats open through November\\nThe first study, conducted by researchers in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, started by examining records of 1,110 who had contracted COVID-19 to see who had traveled, leading to the discovery of the cluster of four who had been aboard the same long flight on\\xa0a Boeing 777.\\nThe study was able to show that the viral sequence was unique to the four, with the distinct possibility that two passengers, a married couple seated one behind the other in business class, had contracted COVID-19 before getting on the flight.\\n\"The only location where all four\\xa0persons were in close proximity for an extended period was inside the airplane,\" the study states.\\nSee how things have changed:Coronavirus is changing everyday life across the US\\nThe other study was conducted by Vietnamese and Australian researchers, identifying a 27-year-old businesswoman who had been experiencing a sore throat and cough as the one likely to have spread the infection. After the trip on Vietnamese Airlines Flight 54, a contact tracing effort was mounted to try to limit the spread.\\nIt was found that 11 of the infected passengers in business class were seated relatively close to the woman. The study notes that business class is already far less crowded than economy, which would seem to make transmission less likely.\\nThe infected passenger was seated at a right-side\\xa0window seat. Those later infected included\\xa0the two passengers in front of her and nine in the center aisles closest to her. Only one was on the left side of the cabin. Two passengers in the economy section of the plane also contracted the virus, but the study suggests their cases\\xa0might have come from coming into contact with the virus during immigration and baggage claim, since passengers in the classes are kept separate.\\nThe difficulties of tracking:Why you didn\\'t hear from COVID-19 contact tracers after your flight\\n\"The latest guidance from the international air travel industry classifies the in-flight transmission risk as very low and recommends only the use of face masks without additional measures to increase physical distance on board, such as blocking the middle seats. Our findings challenge these recommendations,\" the study states.\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'WASHINGTON – Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Kamala Harris battled over taxes, the environment and the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus in a debate that gave Americans a more policy-focused and less fiery picture of where the two campaigns stand with weeks to go before the Nov. 3 election.\\nThe 90-minute exchange, the only vice presidential debate of the 2020 cycle, became – as expected – a battle over President Donald Trump, who remained at the White House Wednesday fighting his own case of coronavirus even as he tries to reset a campaign that polling shows is losing ground in several battleground states.\\nFrom its earliest moments, the discussion was far more civil than the widely panned debate last week between Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Though both Pence and Harris came in hot at times and drew sharp contrasts on policies\\xa0they had far more time to discuss issues.\\n\"We’re about freedom and respecting the freedom of the American people,\" Pence argued during a discussion on the pandemic. \\xa0\\nHarris fired back: \"You respect the American people when you tell them the truth.\"\\nMoments:\\'I\\'m speaking\\' vs. \\'If I may finish\\': Pence, Harris spar over COVID-19\\xa0\\nFly:An unexpected guest: Fly lands on Mike Pence\\'s head during debate, goes viral\\nThe two candidates sat 12 feet apart and were separated by plexiglass, inescapable evidence that the coronavirus pandemic has infected every aspect of American life – including the White House, where Pence has been forced to explain why he has not quarantined amid an outbreak of cases among Trump\\'s top staff.\\nThe sparse and socially distanced members of the audience all wore masks – and kept them on –\\xa0after they were admonished not to take them off as Trump\\'s supporters did in Cleveland last week.\\nAs had been largely expected, Harris sought to keep the focus on the Trump administration’s perceived missteps, particularly on the high number of COVID-19 deaths. Pence, by contrast, ripped a page from the Trump playbook by arguing that Biden had been co-opted by the party’s left-wing – and that Harris was an embodiment of that movement.\\nHarris accused Trump of calling those who serve in the military “suckers” and “losers,” terms in news reports that Trump has denied using. And she attacked the Trump administration for trying to abolish the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration\\'s signature health care law.\\xa0In one particularly poignant moment in the debate, Pence pressed Harris on whether she would support adding justice to the Supreme Court, as some Democrats have called for. Harris did not answer the question directly.\\nThere were several notable instances when neither candidate answered directly, such as on a question about whether they had spoken with their respective presidential candidates about how to handle a transfer of power in the event that they become incapacitated. That issue has raised the stakes of the vice presidential contest for some given that Trump is 74 and Biden is 77.\\xa0\\nAnalysts said Pence held his own during the debate –\\xa0and even won a supportive tweet from the president for his performance. But with fewer than four weeks to go and millions of voters already cast, some analysts said Pence needed to hit a home run at the debate to help Trump in the face of worsening poll numbers.\\nBoth candidates probably did what they had to do, several experts said, and like most vice presidential debates, it likely won’t change many voters’ minds.\\n\"Sen. Harris turned in the best debate performance she has given all year. She wove together policy statistics, personal stories, and well-timed barbs -- all while continuing to smile and remind Pence when he interrupted her that she was speaking,” said Lara Brown, director of the Graduate School of Political Management at the George Washington University. “Still…Pence delivered his answers in a calm and authoritative manner. The bottom line is that both reassured their respective partisans of their political competency and policy chops.”\\nAaron Kall, a debate coach at the University of Michigan, argued that Pence walked into the debate with lower expectations and appeared to clear that bar.\\n“There was no major moment in the debate that will move the political needle or radically move independent voters in the race,” Kall said. “Pence\\'s solid rebound performance may be able to provide some momentum to the campaign and energize President Trump ahead of his final two debate performances.\"\\n— John Fritze, Ledyard King, David Jackson\\nIn a post-debate phone call with reporters, the Biden-Harris campaign said Pence dodged questions, acted disrespectfully to Harris and failed to outline a plan to combat the nation’s coronavirus pandemic.\\n“Tonight you saw a contrast on stage,” said Liz Allen, communications director for Harris, adding that Harris outlined how a Biden-Harris administration “would get the coronavirus outbreak under control, expand access to quality and affordable health care and address the threat of climate change.”\\n“What we saw from Mike Pence was more of the same lies and the same interruptions in a different city.”\\nBiden senior advisor Symone Sanders said Harris made a “strong and clear case” for why the Biden-Harris ticket “will stand up for middle-class families, unite this country and win the battle for the soul of the nation.”\\n“She made history tonight as the first Black woman to participate in a vice presidential debate. There was a lot of talk about how she would do. Let’s just say she passed with flying colors,” Sanders said, making a not-so-subtle reference to the fly that was spotted on Pence’s head for a portion of the debate.\\n“Mike Pence used his time to evade, to lie, to attack and talk over Kamala Harris and Susan Page. He didn’t just mansplain. He man-dodged,” Sanders said.\\nFormer South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a onetime Democratic presidential candidate who role-played Pence during Harris’ mock debates, said Pence was “not able to do what he needed to do tonight, which was to somehow change the dynamic of the race.”\\n“The VP kept trying to create this picture that everything’s just going along just fine in America,” he said in a post-debate interview on MSNBC. “And she spoke right through that, explaining how the failures of this presidency have led us to where we are.”\\nHe called it a “command performance” for Harris.\\n“The only real surprise, I would say, was the disrespect that he showed for the moderator and for the rules,” Buttigieg said of Pence. “He’s generally somebody who tries to be very gentlemanly. I don’t know if that was a factor of being spooked about what’s going on with the polls. I don’t know if he was trying to impress his boss. You know often there’s an audience of one you have to think about when you’re part of the Trump machine.”\\n—\\xa0Joey Garrison\\nIn one of the final questions of the night, moderator Susan Page asked both candidates how they would ensure a peaceful transfer of power if Biden and Harris should win in November. \\xa0President Trump has repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power.\\nHarris pointed to the broad coalition she and Biden built, which includes Republicans including Cindy McCain, the wife of the late Sen. John McCain, and former Secretary of State Colin Powell.\\xa0\\nHarris said the Biden campaign believes \"in the American people\" and \"in our democracy.\" She urged viewers to vote.\\n\"We have within our power in these next 27 days to make the decision about what will be the course of our country for the next four years,\" she added.\\xa0\\nOn his responsibility, if Trump refuses a peaceful transfer of power, Pence insisted that he believes the Trump campaign would win re-election and accused Harris and Democrats of trying to overturn the 2016 election results.\\xa0\\n\"President Donald Trump has launched a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life,\" Pence said. \"And I have every confidence that this the same Americans that deliver that historic victory in 2016.\\n\\xa0The question of whether Trump will concede a close election could become moot - Polls in the last week show the president trailing Biden by double digits.\\n— Courtney Subramanian\\nPence tried to get Harris to answer a question that she and Biden have been dodging: Do they support expanding the Supreme Court as many liberals are advocating?\\nPence said the public deserves to know, calling it a classic case if trying to change the rules if you can’t win by the rules.\\nHarris preferred to talk about Republicans’ decision to move forward with filling the current Supreme Court vacancy so close to an election.\\n“I’m so glad we went through a little history lesson. Let’s do that a little more,” she said. Harris went back to 1864, when she said Abraham Lincoln didn’t think it right to fill a vacancy 27 days before an election.\\n“The American people are voting right now and it should be their decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime,” she said.\\nPence noted that Harris hadn’t said whether she wants to expand the court.\\n“If you haven’t figured it out yet, the straight answer is, they are going to pack the Supreme Court,” he said.\\nHarris said Trump has been stacking the bench with people “who are purely ideological.” Of the 50 people Trump appointed to the appeals court, none are Black, she charged.\\nIf Pence wants to talk about packing the court, she said, “let’s have that discussion.”\\n“I just want the record to reflect,” Pence said, “that she never answered the question.”\\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\\nPence and Harris disagreed whether “justice was served” in the case of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old woman in Louisville, Kentucky who was shot and killed by police officers during an attempted search for drugs and cash that went horribly wrong.\\nNone of the three officers were charged with killing Taylor, an unarmed Black woman.\\xa0One officer was charged of first-degree wanton endangerment.\\n“I don’t believe so,” Harris said when asked whether justice was served, adding that she was heartbroken talking with Taylor’s mother and family. “Her family deserves justice. Her life was taken unjustifiably.”\\nPence said, “Our heart breaks for any American innocent life.” He added: “But I trust our justice system – a grand jury that reviewed the evidence.”\\n— Joey Garrison\\nIt will almost certainly be the phrase that will\\xa0pop up the most in the transcript of the first vice presidential debate: “Thank you, Vice President Pence”\\nThere were far fewer interruptions during the debate Wednesday compared with the presidential debate, but Pence embraced a more common debate tactic that has often been used by members of both parties: Running way overtime to get in that last sentence or one more barb.\\n“Thank you, Vice President Pence,” moderator Susan Page of USA TODAY said over and over again to try to move the conversation on.\\nPence even got a laugh line on the clock, according to reporters who were in the room with the two candidates. At one point, when Pence tried to ask for more time to respond to Harris, Page reluctantly said he could have 15 seconds.\\n\"I\\'ve got to have more than that,\" Pence said, sending a ripple of laughter through the auditorium.\\nThough the interruptions were less severe, they did happen. Another phrase that came up frequently was from Harris: “I’m speaking,” she repeatedly said to Pence.\\n— John Fritze\\nHarris turned a question about the future of abortion rights into an argument overfilling a seat on the Supreme Court.\\nAsked what her home state of California should do if Roe v. Wade is overturned, Harris segued to the ongoing fight over filling the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the recent death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Noting that the election is just 27 days away, Harris argued that the seat should be filled by whoever wins on Nov. 3.\\nOn the subject of abortion, “I will always fight for a woman’s right to make a decision about her own body,” she said, emphasizing\\xa0that the decision should rest with the woman – not Trump and Pence.\\n— Michael Collins, Salt Lake City\\nSen. Kamala Harris accused President Donald Trump of calling those who serve in the military “suckers” and “losers,” terms in news reports that Trump denied using.\\nHarris said it was important to consider for the commander in chief that Trump asked at Arlington National Cemetery: “What’s in it for them?” She noted that Trump said the late Sen. John McCain didn’t deserve to be called a hero for his military service because he was a prisoner of war during Vietnam.\\n“This is very important when you want to talk about who is the current commander in chief, and what they care about what they don’t care about,” Harris said.\\nPence, whose son serves in the military, said Trump respects and reveres the military.\\n“Any suggestion otherwise is ridiculous,” Pence said.\\n— Bart Jansen\\nBoth candidates tried to stay on message, which meant they weren’t particularly eager to answer questions that they saw as potentially problematic - especially on environmental issues.\\nFor Pence, it was whether climate change is an “existential threat” that needs to be addressed with swift and aggressive action. Trump has questioned the science behind climate change and has called it a “hoax” despite assessments from his own administration that the threat is real and exacerbated by human activity.\\n\"As I said, the climate is changing,\" Pence said without addressing the topic in any detail. \"We’ll follow the science.\"\\nThen he pivoted back to a more favorable subject: taxes.\\nFor Harris, it was the Green New Deal, the ultra-progressive plan to not only address climate change but to reconstruct the economy, which included a call for free housing for the poor and a quick end to fossil fuels.\\nHarris, who was a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, declined to talk about the proposal but instead pivoted to the Biden’s plan to create millions of jobs in the renewable energy sector and eliminate carbon emissions by 2050. Biden has rejected the Green New Deal.\\nAfter dodging on the Green New Deal, she also went on the attack, saying “we have seen a pattern with this administration that they don’t believe in science.”\\n— Ledyard King\\nPence invited the parents of a humanitarian aid worker who was killed in Syria to the debate to help him make a point during a discussion of global leadership.\\n\\xa0“When Joe Biden was vice president, they hesitated for a month,” he said.\\nMueller was abducted Aug. 4, 2013, and she endured rape and torture for 18 months. Her parents, Carl and Marsha Mueller have said the Obama administration vowed to do everything it could to investigate her abduction, but everything wasn’t enough.\\nPence praised Trump for taking decisive action in killing one of Mueller’s Islamic State tormenters, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\\nHarris said to the family that she knows about their daughter and she expressed her condolences.\\n“What happened should never have happened,” she said. “And I know Joe Biden feels the same way.”\\n— Maureen Groppe and Bart Jansen\\nThe world\\'s most famous COVID-19 patient is weighing in on the debate, and, not surprisingly, President Trump is giving the nod to his vice president over Kamala Harris.\\n\"Mike Pence is doing GREAT! She is a gaffe machine,\" Trump said in one of several items posted during the debate.\\nAmong other posts, Trump replayed a clip from the debate and mocked Biden over China.\\nTrump\\'s cheerleading drew mockery of its own.\\n\"Pence and Trump have perfected the art of bullying the moderator, avoiding the questions and fostering a clown rodeo during debates,\" tweeted commentator Tim O\\'Brien.\\n– David Jackson\\nOne of Pence’s top goals in the debate Wednesday was to try to paint Harris as too liberal for the blue-collar voters in battleground states who backed President Barack Obama in the past but switched to President Donald Trump in 2016.\\nPence hammered away on the point throughout the first hour of the debate – in one exchange asserting that Harris, a California Democrat, was “the most liberal member of the United States Senate in 2019, more liberal than Bernie Sanders.”\\xa0\\nBut for much of the debate, Pence focused those attacks directly at Joe Biden rather than Harris herself. Pence questioned Biden’s campaign’s position on taxes, accused the Democrats of taking environmental stances – such as on the Green New Deal -- that he claimed would “kill jobs.”\\nThe move put Harris on defense several times, countering that Biden’s position was not to ban fracking, for instance, and not to raise taxes on Americans earning more than $400,000.\\xa0\\nBiden has a long career as centrist Democrat in American politics, but the Trump campaign has frequently sought to paint the Biden-Harris ticket as being subsumed by the left-wing of the Democratic Party. The tension on that issue led to one of Biden’s most quoted moments in the presidential debate last week when he told Trump that “I am the Democratic Party.”\\n-- John Fritze\\nHarris accused the Trump-Pence\\xa0administration of being cozy with U.S. adversaries and betraying the trust of NATO allies overseas.\\n“You’ve got to be loyal to your friends,” Harris said. “What we’ve seen with Donald Trump is he has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world. Let’s take for example Russia.”\\nHarris said Trump “took the word of Vladimir Putin over the U.S. intelligence community” when it came to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.\\nShe said Trump has hurt America’s standing overseas because “Donald Trump doesn’t understand what it means to be honest.”\\n— Joey Garrison\\nPence, asked about whether he believes that climate change has made natural disasters worse over the years, said he believes the climate is changing but downplayed the severity of recent hurricanes and fires.\\n\"The climate is changing. The issue is, what\\'s the cause and what do we do about it,\" Pence said.\\xa0\\nHe continued by saying that a Biden administration would put the U.S. back into the Paris Accord, a 2015 climate agreement with nearly 200 countries that Trump pulled out of.\\xa0\\nPence said continued fires that have leveled communities on the West Coast could be helped with better forest management and said of hurricanes that \"there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago.\"\\n— Christal Hayes\\nHarris chided Pence for referring to the recent trade war with China as one of the Trump administration’s accomplishments.\\n“You lost that trade war,” she said. “You lost it.”\\nHarris said the trade war with Beijing has cost the U.S. manufacturing jobs and harmed the nation’s farmers, forcing many of them into bankruptcy.\\n“We’re looking at people who are trying to figure out how they\\'re going to pay rent by the end of the month,” she said. “…This is where the economy is in America right now, and it is because of the catastrophe and the failure of leadership of this administration.”\\n— Michael Collins, Salt Lake City\\nOn the subject of trade, Pence tried to attack Biden on China while Harris went after Pence for opposing the bailout of the auto industry.\\nPence first disputed Harris’ critique of Trump’s handling of trade negotiations with China.\\n“Lost a trade war with China? Joe Biden’s never fought it,” Pence said.\\nHe accused Biden of being a “cheerleader of Communist China through the last several decades.”\\nHarris responded that Biden “is responsible for saving America’s auto industry and you voted against it.” She was referring to Biden’s role, as Obama’s vice president, in helping auto manufacturers recover from the Great Recession and Pence’s opposition to the approach as a member of the House.\\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\\nHarris attacked the Trump administration for trying to abolish the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration\\'s signature health care law.\\xa0\\n\"If you have pre-existing conditions, heart disease, diabetes breast cancer - they\\'re coming for you,\" Harris said.\\xa0\\nThe Trump administration has backed a Supreme Court challenge that could undo protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions.\\xa0\\nAbout 100 million people in the U.S. could see higher premiums or out-of-pocket costs if the ACA’s pre-existing condition protection is repealed.\\xa0\\nPence called the ACA, also known as Obamacare, a \"disaster.\" He claimed the Trump administration has a plan to improve health care and protect people with pre-existing conditions, which is already in place under Obamacare, but offered no details on a plan.\\xa0\\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order on Sept. 24 to end surprise medical billing and protect people with pre-existing conditions, but the directive has no legal weight and did not detail how it would be implemented.\\xa0\\n— Courtney Subramanian\\nHarris slammed the Trump-Pence administration on environmental policy, accusing the administration of not “believing in science.”\\n“Joe understands that the west coast of our country is burning including my home state of California,” Harris said.\\n“Joe believes in science,” she said. “We’ve seen a pattern from this administration – and that’s they don’t believe in science.”\\nHarris did not directly address a question about her past support for the new Green New Deal. She pushed back at Pence’s charges that Biden wants to ban fracking.\\n“Joe Biden will not ban fracking,” she said.\\nModerator Susan Page then asked Pence whether he believes climate change is an existential threat to the country.\\n“We’ll follow the science,” Pence said, but then quickly shifted, accusing Harris and Biden of wanting to raise taxes.\\n— Joey Garrison\\nPence has made his share of interruptions over both Harris and debate moderator Susan Page, and it hasn\\'t gone unnoticed on social media.\\n\"A white man talking over two women is a very 1950s approach to debating,\" tweeted Barack Obama administration official Chris Lu.\\nRepublicans say Pence is just trying to set the record straight, but other observers said it has set a mood.\\n\"Pence not exactly looking like a Happy Warrior,\" historian Michael Beschloss tweeted.\\n– David Jackson\\nIn the first 30 minutes of the debate, the contrast between the liberal African American senator from California and the conservative vice president from Indiana wasn’t just policy, it was style as well.\\nHarris was animated, smiling often and repeatedly shaking her head when she disagreed with Pence. Pence was more measured, interrupting at times, telling her at one point “you’re entitled to your own opinion but not your facts.”\\nAt one point, Harris talked about the “memorable” day that Biden offered her a place on the ticket.\\n“I though of my mother who came to the U.S. (from India) at the age of 19 … And the thought that I’d be sitting here I know would make her proud,” she said, as she briefly looked skyward. “She must looking down on us.\\nPence graciously acknowledged her place in history.\\n“I never expected to be on the stage four years ago so I know the feeling,” he said.\\n— Ledyard King\\nPence said the “American economy” is on the ballot, in response to a question about taxes.\\n“You just heard Sen. Harris tell you, on Day 1, Joe Biden is going to raise your taxes,” Pence said.\\nHarris protested: “That’s not what I said.”\\nPence then accused Biden of wanting to also “bury the economy under a Green New Deal,” abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking.\\nHarris retorted that she thought “this is supposed to be a debate based on facts.”\\n“You’re entitled to your own opinion but you’re not entitled to your own facts,” she said.\\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\\nSen. Kamala Harris attacked President Donald Trump for how much he paid in income taxes, after the New York Times reported he paid $750 a year for two recent years.\\n“We now know Donald Trump owes and is in debt for $400 million,” Harris said in response to a question about greater transparency about the health of a president. “It’d be really good to know who the commander in chief owes money to because the American people have a right to know what is influencing the president’s decisions.”\\n“Donald Trump has been about covering up everything,” Harris added.\\nVice President Mike Pence shook his head as Harris spoke. Pence said Trump has called the report inaccurate and that he paid tens of millions of dollars in payroll and property taxes.\\nPence called Trump a businessman who created tens of thousands of jobs. Pence said Trump began four years ago to “turn this economy around, cutting taxes, rolling back regulations, fighting for free and fair trade.”\\n— Bart Jansen\\nHarris said Biden chose her as his running mate because they share the same values.\\n“Joe and I were raised in a very similar way,” she said. “We were raised with values that are about our work, about the value and the dignity of public service, and about the importance of fighting for the dignity of all people.”\\nHarris said she and Biden “share a purpose, which is about lifting up the American people.”\\n— Michael Collins, Salt Lake City\\nPence didn’t answer the question posed by the moderator who asked he’s talked to Trump about what would happen if Trump can’t adequately do his job.\\nUnder the 25th amendment, the president can temporarily transfer power to the vice president if he can’t sufficiently handle his duties. That could happen if, for example, the president’s COVID-19 illness worsens.\\nInstead, Pence accused Harris of playing politics by saying she wouldn’t take Trump’s word that a vaccine is safe. He also attacked the Obama administration’s handling of the swine flu.\\n\\xa0\"Harris also didn\\'t tackle the question head-on either; instead, she talked about her qualifications for the job.\\n— Maureen Groppe\\nDuring a spirited back and forth with Pence over the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, Harris said she would only take a vaccine to treat COVID-19 if medical experts endorse it.\\nShe made clear she would not do so if only Trump says to take the vaccine. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0“If the public health professionals, if Dr. Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I’ll be the first in line to take it – absolutely,” Harris said. “But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I’m not taking it.”\\nPence accused Harris of “undermining the public confidence in a vaccine.”\\n— Joey Garrison.\\nVice President Mike Pence said the Trump administration has \"great confidence\" in the American people to follow federal health guidelines on stopping the spread of the coronavirus despite a Rose Garden event 11 days ago that has emerged as a potential super spreader event for senior adminsitration officials and congressional officials.\\nPresident Donald Trump, several White House officials and congressional allies tested positive for COVID-19 after attending an event to announce the president\\'s nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. Few people were spotted in masks and were seated shoulder to shoulder.\\nPence said that \"many of the people\" at the veent were tested for coronavirus and pointed out that the event was outdoors.\\n\"President Trump and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interest of their health,\" Pence said.\\nPence accused Harris and former Vice President Joe Biden of focusing on coronavirus mandates, adding: \"We’re about freedom and respecting the freedom of the American people.\"\\n– Courtney Subramanian\\nSen. Kamala Harris accused the Trump administration of hiding information about the severity and lethality of the coronavirus after learning about it in late January.\\nParents worried about their children getting sick. Workers worried about losing their jobs. But the administration was inept for failing to describe the risks they faced and the precautions there were necessary, Harris said.\\n\\xa0“The American people have had to sacrifice far too much because of the incompetence of this administration,” Harris said. “That is asking too much of the people.”\\n— Bart Jansen\\nMinutes into the presidential debate last month it was clear President Donald Trump came to the stage with a plan to aggressively confront Democrat Joe Biden.\\nIt was equally clear just minutes into Wednesday’s vice presidential debate that both campaigns had reassessed their approach after that confrontation. Pence remained silent as Harris ripped into the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus.\\n“This administration has forfeited their right to reelection,” she said.\\nHarris was silent as Pence defended the high U.S. death toll, even as Pence took a shot at the former vice president over past scandals involving plagiarism. \\xa0\\n“The reality is when you look at the Biden plan,” Pence says, “it looks a little like plagiarism.”\\nThat, Pence said, is “something that Joe Bien knows a little bit\\xa0about.”\\nDuring their first discussion period, both Harris and Pence quickly shot down interruptions from their opponents.\\xa0\\n\"I\\'m speaking,\" Harris asserted as Pence tried to jump in.\\xa0\\nThe Sept. 29 presidential debate was widely panned after it quickly went off the rails as both candidates hurled insults at each other and Trump repeatedly interrupted Biden, forcing moderator Chris Wallace to press the president to allow Biden to speak.\\nIn a clear recognition of the earlier debate, moderator Susan Page of USA TODAY offered a warning to the candidates at the start.\\n“We want a debate that is lively but America also deserves a debate that is civil,” she said.\\n— John Fritze\\nThe first and only vice presidential debate of the 2020 election is underway.\\nPence and Harris are facing off in Salt Lake City, Utah, at a critical moment in the race, as President Donald Trump is battling COVID-19, talks over a stimulus to blunt the economic impact of the pandemic has stalled (again) and several battleground polls show Democratic nominee Joe Biden with a narrow but growing lead.\\nThe two candidates will fight it out for 90 minutes over the virus, the economy, health care and other issues. Trump’s approach to the presidency might come up, too.\\n—\\xa0John Fritze\\nAs Mike Pence and Kamala Harris debate, President Donald Trump\\'s aides are\\xa0working to satisfy his desire to get back out on the campaign trail as soon as possible – perhaps early next week.\\nThe campaign is exploring the prospect of an event on Monday in\\xa0Pittsburgh, an aide said. The aide did not elaborate, saying only it would be an \"event\" and not a \"rally\" for the COVID-stricken president.\\nTrump, who is still recovering from the virus, also wants to make the debate with Joe Biden in Miami, scheduled for a week from Thursday.\\nIt\\'s uncertain whether Trump will be able to make either campaign stop.\\n– David Jackson\\nGetting a seat in the audience for a national debate is usually a hot ticket.\\nThis year, as for many events taking place during the pandemic, there’s a big caveat in the fine print.\\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates and the host site, the University of Utah, want ticket holders to know that when it comes to coronavirus, they’re on their own.\\xa0\\n“The ticket holder relieves the CPD and the event site host of any and all liability of any kind and character....in the event of fire, natural disaster...injury or sickness (including COVID-19),” the ticket advises in red letters.\\n— John Fritze\\nGuests who won the lottery for tickets to the vice presidential debate wore salmon-colored surgical masks issued by the host University of Utah.\\nMichelle Pedersen, 44, who is studying opera performance and who has performed on the stage where the candidates will appear, said she was excited about the experience.\\n\"It will be incredibly memorable because we have a female, who is going to be fabulous, up there tonight,” Pedersen said.\\nJuliette Ainsworth, 40, from France, voiced some concern about the future because of COVID-19, but not health cares for the debate.\\n\"I\\'m worried for the future but not for the debate tonight,” Ainsworth said. “I think everybody has been taken care of.\"\\nJustin Ravago, 19, an undergraduate in business economics from Boise, Idaho, said he was looking forward to a more proper debate than the presidential candidates held last week.\\n\"I want to hear what they have to say rather than a crossfire of words,” Ravago said.\\n— Bart Jansen\\nThe official protest area outside the security perimeter of the vice presidential debate seemed to be dominated not by supporters of either Mike Pence or Kamala Harris but by demonstrators upset about Turkey.\\nStill, there were enough people there for the presidential politics that some heated debates ensued.\\n“Make America what it was before Trump,” a Joe Biden supporter yelled back at a group of Donald Trump backers.\\nThe Trump supporters booed as a truck drove by, blaming Pence, as chair of the administration’s coronavirus task force, for the number of people dying from COVID-19.\\nChris Quinones, 52, of Park City, Utah, said she came to the campus to show her support for the president because she’s for “law and order.”\\n“We don’t want to see our country look like New York City,” she said.\\nQuinones, who wore an Army face mask and a blue Trump hat, said she voted for Hillary Clinton four years ago because, “I didn’t know any better.”\\nQuinones said her eyes were opened during the impeachment of the president. She felt that Trump’s actions were being taken out of context.\\n“I did a 180,” she said of her support for Trump.\\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\\nThe University of Utah held a ticket lottery for students, with 60 lucky winners allocated a seat in the hall.\\n\"In order not to detract from the live televised event for the many millions of people watching the broadcast, live audience members shall refrain from\\xa0expressing approval or disapproval of events on stage as the debate unfolds,” the tickets state.\\nKingsbury Hall, the venue for tonight\\'s vice presidential debate, is the performing arts center on the University of Utah campus and opened in 1930. The debate seal — an eagle with the legend \"The Union and the Constitution forever\" — hangs from the ceiling.\\nThe ticket also says members of the audience will not hold the Commission on Presidential Debates or the event host liable for any sickness including COVID-19.\\n— Bart Jansen\\nSophomores Cooper McGee and Jake Larsen sat in lawn chairs on the ledge outside the second-story windows of their student rental house, taking in the vice presidential spectacle across the street at the University of Utah.\\n“I figured we’d be missing out if we didn’t,” McGee, a 20-year-old from Boise, Idaho, who is studying business management at the university and had just finished an online class.\\nThe Biden Harris 2020 signs in their yard made clear which side they’re supporting in the debate.\\n“I really don’t feel like America is headed in the right direction under Trump,” McGee said. “If I were not speaking out, then I’m not doing my part.”\\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\\nThe spat over plexiglass is over – and the plexiglass won.\\nAfter Vice President Mike Pence requested plexiglass not be placed on his side of the vice presidential debate stage -- arguing it wasn’t necessary to protect the spread of COVID-19 -- the Pence team conceded late Tuesday.\\nFrank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., a co-chairman of the Commission on Presidential Debates, told the New York Times that Pence’s staff agreed to accept the placement of the plexiglass dividers.\\nPence and Harris will sit 12 feet and 3 inches from each other with tables in front of them. Plexiglass will be to each of their sides, photos of the debate stage show.\\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates made the plexiglass part of new safety guidelines installed after President Donald Trump and several Republican allies tested positive for COVID-19 just days following last week’s first presidential debate in Cleveland, Ohio.\\nBut Marc Short, Pence’s chief of staff, objected, saying that it wasn’t needed because of other safety accommodations including daily testing and the extended separation between the candidates on stage.\\n“If she wants it, she’s more than welcome to surround herself with plexiglass if that makes her feel more comfortable,” Short told The Washington Post on Tuesday before later conceding.\\n— Joey Garrison\\nCoronavirus. Bible. Systemic Racism. Dr. Anthony Fauci.\\nThose are some of the words that could win a Bingo during the vice presidential debate.\\nCustomized “Debate Bingo” cards are scattered along the tables in the media filing hall at the University of Utah.\\nThere’s even a Bingo stamping device (which this reporter initially thought was hand sanitizer) to stamp the cards as keywords rush by Mental fitness. Electoral College. Masks. Voter Fraud.\\nBingo!\\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\\nPence and Harris will meet Wednesday for their only debate. The 90-minute event begins at 9 p.m. ET and won’t be hard to find: It’ll be\\xa0broadcast on every major network. Viewers streaming on USATODAY.com will have the added benefit of real-time fact-checking and political context.\\xa0\\nWhat to watch for? To begin with, the debate comes as the nation has watched President Donald Trump fight his own case of COVID-19, and a steady stream of White House officials also test positive. That issue, and the issue of how the White House has responded, is guaranteed to be front and center.\\xa0\\nThere are other top themes as well. Both candidates will try to sell themselves as a credible replacement for whoever becomes the president in an election in which both candidates are in their mid-70s (Trump is 74 and Biden is 77). That dynamic in particular makes this vice presidential debate potentially more interesting than those that have come before it.\\xa0\\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City,\\xa0and John Fritze\\nRepublican attorneys general slammed Kamala Harris ahead of Wednesday night’s vice presidential debate, accusing Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s running mate of spewing “dangerous rhetoric” and showing “absolute disregard for the rule of law.”\\nAttorneys general from Louisiana, Utah and Arkansas went after Harris’ record as California’s attorney general and as a U.S. senator, specifically citing her stance on immigration, energy, gun control, policing and other issues. The criticism could foreshadow Vice President Mike Pence’s line of attack against Harris during the debate at the University of Utah.\\n“Kamala Harris is dangerous and divisive,” Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said during a news conference in Salt Lake City. “She had no business being the attorney general of California with her disregard for the rule of law. She has no business being a U.S. senator. And Kamala Harris certainly has no business being the vice president of the United States.”\\nHarris, who has served as California’s junior Democratic senator since 2017, was the state’s attorney general for six years before entering Congress. Republicans have heavily scrutinized her record as attorney general, arguing that it provides some insight to the kind of policies she would pursue if she and Biden are elected in November.\\n“We do not aspire the United States to be California,” said Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, chairman of the Republican Attorneys General Association. “However, if we elect a Biden-Harris ticket, that’s exactly what the American people are going to get.”\\n— Michael Collins, Salt Lake City\\nMany Biden campaign supporters are hoping to see Sen. Kamala Harris take on Vice President Mike Pence the way the former prosecutor went after Brett Kavanaugh, Jeff Sessions and others who have testified before the Senate committees on which she serves. (In fact, that was the first remark this reporter heard from her taxi driver after arriving in Salt Lake City on Tuesday.)\\nHarris’ tough debating reputation was also cemented by her attack on Joe Biden’s past opposition to busing during the Democratic presidential debates last year.\\nBut Harris isn’t coming to the vice presidential debate stage “to eviscerate” Pence, said Symone Sanders, senior adviser to the Biden campaign.\\n“She is there to really talk to people at home and breakthrough about what they\\'re feeling, their lives and their families,” Sanders told reporters Wednesday morning.\\nThat’s a smart strategy, according to Christine Matthews, a GOP pollster and Trump critic. Matthews tweeted that she understands Harris’ team has been studying research on how voters perceive women in these situations.\\n“She will be fighting stereotypes of a \\'nasty’ woman while she makes contrast points,” Matthews tweeted.\\nResearch by the Barbara Lee Foundation shows voters will back a male candidate they don’t like, if they think that he’s qualified. But they won’t vote for a woman if she’s not “likeable.”\\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\\nNeither of the vice presidential candidates are\\xa0eliciting warm, fuzzy feelings from a majority of voters, according to a new Pew Research Center survey released before the vice presidential debate.\\nAbout half (51%) of registered voters give Pence “cold” ratings and a slightly smaller share (48%) said the same about Harris.\\nSlightly more than one-third (36%) feel “warmly” toward Pence; 39% do about Harris.\\nThe ratings largely reflect partisan differences with most Republicans feeling positive about Pence but negative about Harris. The reverse is true for Democrats, according to the Sept. 30-Oct. 5 survey of 11,929 adults, including 10,543 registered voters.\\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\\nTwo of the limited number of guests Kamala Harris can bring to the debate under COVID restrictions are Utah residents who\\xa0the campaign says represent “the communities and the families that a Joe Biden and Kamala Harris administration will fight for.”\\nTeacher Deborah Gatrell is a Blackhawk pilot and Army National Guard veteran. She’s also the only Democrat running for the Salt Lake City council.\\n“As we all know, down-ballot change is where we see progress made,” Liz Allen, communications director for Harris, told reporters Wednesday.\\nState Rep. Angela Romero will also be cheering on Harris from inside the debate hall. The campaign called her a longtime community organizer for progressive causes, equality and social justice.\\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\\nWho voters expect to win the vice presidential debate is different from which candidate they think is better prepared to become president, according to a new Morning Consult/Politico poll.\\nVoters surveyed Oct. 2-4 gave the debating edge to Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., over Vice President Mike Pence: 43% to 37%. That’s due primarily to independents picking Harris while Democrats and Republicans backed their party’s own running mates.\\nBut 57% of voters said they believed Pence is prepared to step into the Oval Office if necessary compared with 50% for Harris.\\nPence did better overall because more Democrats found him prepared to be president than the share of Republicans who said the same of Harris.\\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\\nThe vice presidential candidates are staying in the West following their debate in Salt Lake City.\\nVice President Mike Pence is scheduled to go to Nevada on Thursday and Arizona on Friday.\\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris are heading to Arizona on Thursday, where they’re expected to meet with American Indian tribal leaders and embark on a “Soul of the Nation” bus tour.\\nHarris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, is campaigning in Colorado on Thursday and Friday.\\nBiden is expected to be in Nevada on Friday.\\n— Maureen Groppe, Salt Lake City\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': 'Deep in the Democratic stronghold of Fairfax County, Virginia, about 50 of President Donald Trump\\'s\\xa0supporters\\xa0gathered, wrapping themselves in American flags and waving Trump 2020 banners as they chanted, \"Four more years! Four more years!\"\\nIt was Sept. 19, and the county had begun early voting. The Republican\\xa0volunteers stood on the sidewalk outside the concrete county government center building. Steps away, voters waited\\xa0to cast their\\xa0ballot while lined up\\xa0on blue social distancing markers.\\nAs the crowd grew – along with the chants – county elections officials began whisking the voters into the building, despite concerns of spreading COVID-19. County officials explained that\\xa0several voters felt threatened\\xa0by the crowd\\xa0and requested escorts in\\xa0and out of the polling place, though the Trump volunteers had not\\xa0violated any election laws.\\n\"We were actually trying to encourage people to vote,\" said\\xa0Sean Rastatter, 23, a software engineer and Republican who helped organize the event aimed at increasing GOP turnout. \"The point of it was to remind people that early voting was taking place, since it had started a few days earlier. There wasn\\'t anything close to voter intimidation.\"\\xa0\\nTrump\\'s call\\xa0for an \"army\" of\\xa0supporters to \"monitor\" voting has raised concerns during an already\\xa0vitriolic\\xa0presidential election campaign about\\xa0voter intimidation and\\xa0suppression of minority groups.\\nVoting rights activists and government officials said they worry Trump\\'s supporters\\xa0will scare away Democratic voters fearful of confrontation, including voters from Hispanic, Black, Asian and indigenous communities who\\xa0have been disproportionately hurt by the pandemic,\\xa0police violence, immigration enforcement\\xa0and\\xa0growing rates of hate\\xa0crimes under the Trump administration.\\xa0\\n“The rhetoric itself is suppressive,\" said\\xa0Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat.\\xa0“All of that taken together is aimed to suppress turnout. As elections officials, we have to clearly state that voter suppression is systemic racism.\"\\nIn repeated tweets, speeches and paid advertisements,\\xa0Trump and his campaign have called for an \"army\" of poll watchers to monitor contested election areas. \"Fight for President Trump,\" reads one ad on Twitter, directing supporters to the website \"ArmyForTrump.com.\"\\nTrump has repeatedly called the election \"corrupt,\" which some experts said is aimed at reducing confidence in the results and dissuading some voters from even bothering to cast a ballot. That would favor\\xa0Trump whose core supporters – older, white Americans – are the most consistent voters, regardless of circumstance.\\nTrump\\xa0tweeted Friday that a mistake by an elections board in Ohio in sending out\\xa0ballots to the wrong voters was further evidence of a \"rigged election.\" The elections board said new ballots were being distributed.\\n\"My biggest concern, and both sides do this, is undermining confidence in elections across the board,\"\\xa0Trey Grayson,\\xa0a Republican and\\xa0former Kentucky secretary of state, said Tuesday. \"We\\'ve got to have people trust the outcome. The losers have to believe it was a fair fight.\"\\nThere have been few concrete examples of voter intimidation at polling sites, though\\xa0the USA has a long history of violence against people of color during elections, including\\xa0state and local lawmen attacking Black voting rights activists with nightsticks and tear gas in Alabama in 1965,\\xa0which resulted in the passage that year of the federal Voting Rights Act.\\nRastatter, the Republican from Fairfax County, said he\\'d never participate in anything that scared off voters. He said voter intimidation is a serious charge, and police who investigated the incident declared no laws were broken.\\n\"This is one of these elections where people are so hyper partisan,\" he said.\\nExperts said\\xa0even subtle shifts in voting patterns could change the outcome of elections.\\nDuring the 2000 presidential election, George W. Bush won Florida\\xa0and its 25 Electoral College votes by just 537 votes.\\nVoter suppression could\\xa0shape\\xa0races for state legislatures, which will use the 2020 census results next session to map out election boundaries.\\xa0In most states, whatever party controls the legislature determines how those boundaries are drawn\\xa0and can use them to gerrymander favorable districts for Congress.\\xa0\\n“This is all, in my mind, to deter people from showing up at the polls,\" said\\xa0Myrna Perez, director of New York University\\'s Brennan Center for Justice\\'s Voting Rights and Elections Program. \"These statements are designed to make people fearful to vote.\"\\nMary McCord, a former top federal prosecutor focusing on national security and a professor at Georgetown Law School in Washington, said\\xa0her biggest fear\\xa0is that armed groups of Trump supporters will \"self-activate\" in response to his calls to watch polling places.\\nLast week, Michigan state and federal prosecutors arrested 13 men they said conspired to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Prosecutors said the men discussed trying Whitmer for treason over COVID-19 closures that Trump opposed. On April 17, Trump tweeted, \"LIBERATE MICHIGAN!\" as part of a series of tweets criticizing Whitmer, a Democrat, and pandemic-related lockdowns.\\nVirginia Gov. Ralph Northam, another Democrat and frequent focus of Trump criticism, was targeted by the same group, the FBI\\xa0said Tuesday.\\n\"Some people are just not very smart and buy into conspiracy theories. And some people are smart, and they would happily disenfranchise voters,\" McCord said. \"You can\\'t ignore the disinformation coming straight from the president. He right now is the greatest threat to our democracy. And people do\\xa0act on the things he says.\"\\nThe concerns are building at least in part because of a rise in violent hate crimes. The FBI said last year\\xa0that although the overall number of hate crimes dropped slightly in 2018, the number of violent hate crimes hit a 16-year high – from intimidation and assault to homicide.\\xa0\\nA Department of Homeland Security report last month\\xa0concluded that white supremacists \"will remain the most persistent and lethal threat in the Homeland.\"\\nDuring the first presidential debate Sept. 29, Trump called for the far-right Proud Boys group to \"stand back and stand by.\" Though the White House said Trump was condemning the group, its members declared they were ready to follow his orders.\\n\"I\\'m concerned they\\'ll take the constant daily tweets about election fraud, that that\\'s their signal, in their view, their license to self-activate,\" McCord said. \"They put on this façade, these right-wing groups, that they are patriots and that they have an obligation to protect the vote or protect the election or protect the president.\"\\nElections experts said that\\xa0there\\'s no evidence\\xa0 to support Trump\\'s complaints\\xa0about widespread voter fraud but that fair elections are under\\xa0attack.\\xa0\\nGrayson, the former Kentucky election official who served as president of the National Association of Secretaries of State, said\\xa0it\\'s no secret politicians want to \"shape the electorate.\"\\nUntil 2018, the Republican National Committee had to submit all of its poll-watching plans for review by a judge after getting caught hiring off-duty law enforcement officers and stationing them only in minority precincts during the New Jersey governor\\'s election in 1981. Those armed officers wore \"National Ballot Security Task Force\" armbands and demanded Black or Latino voters show voting registration cards.\\nThe poll-watching consent decree expired in 2018. In 2013, the Supreme Court eliminated a provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act requiring areas with a history of discrimination to get federal approval before changing the rules. Fourteen states\\xa0– all but one controlled by Republican legislatures – toughened voter ID laws.\\nRepublican operatives were linked to the\\xa0data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica during the 2016 presidential race, which\\xa0targeted 3.5 million Black Americans for \"deterrence,\" according to\\xa0an investigation by Channel 4 News in London. The report said operatives bought Facebook advertisements aimed at dissuading Black voters from casting a ballot, rather than trying to persuade them to pick one candidate over another.\\nThough the federal government has typically taken the lead in enforcing the\\xa0Voting Rights Act, some liberal activists worry the Trump administration\\'s Justice Department lacks the interest to aggressively protect voting rights.\\xa0\\n\"We understand there are folks who came before us who were literally risking their lives to vote,\" said\\xa0Jamal Watkins, the NAACP\\'s vice president of civic engagement. \"This notion that violence is a ruse and not real – it scares a lot of us.\"\\nWatkins said that given the revelations about the role Cambridge Analytica played in dissuading Black voters, it\\'s not surprising that turnout among Black voters dropped in 2016 for the first time in 20 years during a presidential election, falling below 60%, according to the\\xa0Pew Research Center. Black voter turnout had hit\\xa0a record high of 66.6% in 2012, when Democrat Barack Obama, the nation\\'s only\\xa0Black president, won a second term.\\nA\\xa0Brennan Center study found that wait times in 2018 for Black and Hispanic voters averaged 45% longer than for white voters, a more subtle form of voter suppression than outright intimidation.\\n\"We\\'re not blind. We see there\\'s an intentionality behind all of this. That\\'s the sad truth,\" Watkins said. \"This is not conspiracy theory. This is factual. We have seen it play out in what happened in 2016.\"\\nSome voting rights activists said they are worried\\xa0Trump\\'s call for poll monitors sets\\xa0\\xa0an unprecedented tone.\\nMichael Steele,\\xa0former chairman of the Republican National Party, said\\xa0part of the problem stems from a misunderstanding of what it means to be a certified poll watcher, a legally defined role at the county level. He said\\xa0the president can\\'t just order supporters to look over voters\\' shoulders.\\n“You\\'re not going to be allowed into the voting booth area, and you\\'re not going to be allowed to intimidate voters who are standing in line waiting to go vote. But when you have someone of the president\\'s authority saying something like that, rank-and-file Americans who support the president want to be helpful and will show up on Election Day and go, ‘Well, I\\'m here to watch the polls,’”\\xa0Steele said. \"And then, of course, you run into the problem of some thickheads who want to come armed to the polls, which is nothing more than intimidation.”\\nSix states and the District of Columbia explicitly ban guns at polling sites,\\xa0and weapons are generally\\xa0banned inside polling places at schools or other public property. Though using a firearm to intimidate someone is illegal, simply carrying it in public doesn\\'t violate the law as long as the carrier maintains a certain distance from the polling site, usually 50 to 100 feet.\\nIn Fairfax County, election officials\\xa0said\\xa0social media videos provided a misleading perspective on the Trump rally, whose participants never got closer than 100 feet to the polling site. Voting rights advocates said\\xa0what happened offers a glimpse into potential problems as more Americans vote in person. They said\\xa0voting by mail or voting early are among the best ways to avoid Election Day polling problems. Lawyers across the country are prepared to defend voters in the courts, as needed.\\n“We need to be ready. … Folks need to know their community, have a plan, be prepared for contingencies\\xa0and persist,”\\xa0Perez said.\\xa0\\nVanita Gupta,\\xa0CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said\\xa0\"targeted harassment\" is very much a concern this election.\\n\"We have enough examples in recent memory where elections have been called in states on razor-thin margins. We need to make sure everyone eligible is able to cast a vote and have that vote counted,\" said Gupta, who led the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division under the Obama administration. \"Every single vote does matter.\"\\nThat\\'s why it\\'s critically important elections officials at all levels encourage every qualified voter to vote, said\\xa0Griswold, the Colorado elections official. Like many of her colleagues, both Republican and Democrat, Griswold has reassured voters that the process is safe, secure and trustworthy. Griswold said she gets calls from Black community leaders every time Trump tweets or speaks about poll watchers.\\n\"Voting is supposed to be the great equalizer for our communities,\" she said. “Every American deserves a democracy we can believe in. And that starts at the polls.”\\n'},\n",

Now, there\\'s a new one: Johnson may be one of the few world leaders who understands what Trump faces in the days and weeks ahead after his positive coronavirus diagnosis.\\xa0\\nTrump and COVID-19:President\\xa0in hospital; many infected at White House gathering\\nTrump tests positive for COVID-19:\\xa0Here\\'s what we know.\\nTrump is receiving treatment at the Walter Reed National Military Hospital outside Washington, where the White House said he will spend the next few days.\\xa0His doctors were\\xa0\"cautiously optimistic\"\\xa0about the president\\'s condition Saturday but did\\xa0not give a timetable for his discharge from the hospital.\\nFirst lady Melania Trump and at least 10\\xa0other people who were in close proximity with the Trumps also tested positive for the new coronavirus.\\xa0\\nWhen Johnson tested positive for coronavirus in late March, he became the first world leader to publicly acknowledge his illness. His descent into the clutches of a disease, which he said he believed he had a\\xa0\"50-50\" chance of surviving, started slowly.\\xa0\\nInitially, Johnson vowed\\xa0it would be \"business as usual\" because he,\\xa0like Trump,\\xa0had only \"mild symptoms\" – a slight fever. He said he would continue to work in isolation from his official office and residence at No. 10 Downing St. in London and keep in constant touch with his Cabinet and lawmakers. He would do this through, he said,\\xa0the\\xa0\"wizardry of modern technology,\" referring to applications such as Zoom and WhatsApp.\\xa0\\n\\'Likely outcome\\':Trump\\'s COVID-19 diagnosis followed waning precautions at White House\\nWithin a few hours of his diagnosis, Johnson\\'s health secretary contracted the virus.\\xa0\\nStill, Johnson\\xa0remained upbeat.\\n\"Although I am sequestered ... I am absolutely confident\\xa0we will beat it\\xa0together,\" he said in a video message published on his social media accounts on April 1.\\xa0\\nHe had been COVID-19-positive for four days.\\xa0\\nA few days later, Johnson appeared on the doorstep of Downing Street to \"Clap for Carers\"\\xa0– applaud hospital staff and other emergency workers battling the epidemic.\\nHe looked unwell, though\\xa0aides insisted he would soon be on the mend, and it wouldn\\'t be long before he could come out of isolation and get back to work full-tilt.\\xa0\\nThen, a change.\\xa0\\nOn April 5, Downing Street released a very brief statement saying that Johnson had been admitted to a hospital for tests purely \"as a precautionary step\"\\xa0because his symptoms persisted almost 10 days after he tested positive.\\nQuestions swirled.\\xa0\\nIt was announced that Dominic Raab, Johnson\\'s foreign secretary, would take over the running of the government if Johnson was incapacitated. But the prime minister, his\\xa0aides insisted, was receiving \"excellent care,\" and there was genuinely nothing to worry about.\\xa0\\nTwo days later, Johnson\\xa0was in intensive care.\\nHe was not put on a ventilator but confirmed later in media interviews that he received what he characterized as \"liters and liters\" of oxygen.\\xa0A succession plan was drawn up, and there were discussions about how to announce it.\\xa0\\nJohnson admitted\\xa0he feared being near death.\\xa0\\nWorld reacts:President Donald Trump\\'s coronavirus infection draws international sympathy and a degree of schadenfreude\\nQueen Elizabeth II was briefed on the\\xa0situation.\\xa0\\n\"They had a strategy to deal with a \\'death of Stalin\\'-type scenario,\" Johnson told a British newspaper.\\xa0\\nDuring the three nights that Johnson spent in the intensive care unit at London\\'s St. Thomas Hospital, the public was told only that he was there for \"close monitoring,\"\\xa0that his condition\\xa0remained stable and he was in \"good spirits.\"\\nIn an 18-second video Trump posted on Twitter on Friday, immediately before traveling to Walter Reed, he said, \"I think I\\'m doing very well. But we\\'re going to make sure that things work out. The first lady is doing very well. So thank you very much.\"\\nFive hours later, another tweet: \"Going welI, I think! Thank you to all. LOVE!!!\"\\nShortly before midnight, Sean Conley, the president\\'s physician, gave an update, saying in a memo that Trump was\\xa0\"doing very well\" and did not require\\xa0any supplemental oxygen\\xa0but that doctors\\xa0started treating him with\\xa0the antiviral drug remdesivir.\\xa0Remdesivir has shortened recovery time for some coronavirus patients.\\nSaturday, Conley said the president was still doing \"very well.\" He was not on oxygen or having trouble breathing, and he was fever-free.\\nThe\\xa0president’s vitals over the past day were \"very concerning\" and the next 48 hours would be critical for his care, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told The Associated Press on Saturday.\\nTrump posted a video on Twitter saying he was doing well, but the next couple of days would be the \"real test.\"\\nTrump given remdesivir to fight COVID-19:Here\\'s what you need to know about it\\nSince the coronavirus outbreak began, doctors and scientists have stressed\\xa0that those who test positive for the virus respond\\xa0in different ways.\\nJohnson\\'s doctors have not formally released information about which drugs he was treated with, but in March. remdesivir was not widely used.\\xa0\\nJohnson, like Trump, is categorized as obese. At 74, Trump is 18 years older than Johnson. Both men are at high risk from the disease.\\xa0\\xa0\\nBritain\\'s leader left the hospital April 9,\\xa0then spent two weeks recovering at Chequers, the prime minister\\'s country retreat, before returning to work.\\nOpinion:I know the pain of COVID-19\\xa0and how challenging recovery can be\\nJohnson did not play down the threat of coronavirus as much as Trump did, but in\\xa0its earliest stages, he resisted calls for a lockdown.\\xa0\\nIn\\xa0news statements,\\xa0Johnson\\xa0has\\xa0repeatedly said that he owes his life to extremely dedicated hospital workers and staff.\\xa0\\n\"They pulled my chestnuts out of the fire, no question,\" he said.\\xa0\\nSeveral weeks after he started back at work, Johnson often appeared to be short of breath in public appearances. He lost weight. The prime minister said this was partly because he had taken up jogging. He denied reports in the British media\\xa0that he is struggling\\xa0to recover from coronavirus and plans to step down in six months.\\n'},\n",

Former President Barack Obama\\'s policy differed from that of the current president in that children were separated from parents only in rare circumstances. Donald Trump\\'s \"zero tolerance\" policy created a blanket separation practice in order to prosecute parents.\\nWhen the first lady went to visit children in a migrant center in Texas in 2018, she drew backlash for\\xa0wearing a green jacket with the words \"I really don\\'t care, do u?\" on the back, which she in the recordings was \"driving liberals crazy... and they deserve it\" when asked why she bought it.\\n\"I\\xa0was trying to get the kid reunited with\\xa0the mom. I didn\\'t have a chance. It needs to go through the process and the law,\" she said in one recording.\\nIn a conversation in June of that year, Trump said\\xa0\"it\\'s sad\" for children in shelters to be away from their parents, but said many of them are better taken\\xa0care of in shelters than they would have been otherwise.\\n\"They even said, the kids they said, \\'Wow, I\\xa0will have my own bed?...

His first dose of tackle football came his freshman year of high school, where his speed separated him from everyone else.\\n“In my experience, a lot of Hispanic kids played it and thought, ‘Yeah, this is fun,’ but they didn’t see anything for them past that,” Davis said. “If the Hispanic people want to see a change and want to see more players in the NFL, they gotta come out and want it. You can’t just hope. You can’t just sit back and say, ‘I wish we’d have more Hispanic players’ and do nothing about it. It’s going to take more than that. And it all starts from an early age, with just coming out and giving it a shot.”\\nTwo-time Pro Bowl left tackle Alejandro Villanueva of the Steelers was born on a Naval Air Station in Meridian, Mississippi, to Spanish parents. He swam and played soccer and estimates that, to this day, he has played more soccer than football.\\nRugby was his first love, even playing for the Spanish national team. But when he realized the sport wasn’t offered on the base where his family was stationed after they moved to Belgium, he found the next closest thing.\\n“Football allowed me to learn the American culture,” Villanueva told USA TODAY Sports. “It was a great way for me to make friends and learn the language because I didn’t speak English at all.”\\nNew York Giants left guard Will Hernandez was born into soccer. His father, Robert, played it professionally in Mexico.\\nBut like so many Central American families seeking a better life, the Hernandezes moved north. And as Will grew interested in sports in Las Vegas, he played what his father played.\\nOne day, Hernandez saw a football practice, the orchestrated movement, the collisions. But more than anything, he saw body types like his own. Currently 6-foot-2 and 327 pounds – which is actually 21 pounds lighter than his draft weight – Hernandez tried out.\\n“There’s everything you need to play this game, learning the playbook, techniques and all of that, but the base fundamentals that you need for this game – toughness, aggressiveness, willingness – the Hispanic and Latino community, that’s us,” Hernandez told USA TODAY Sports. “That’s what’s in our blood. We are all those things. The Hispanic community has a lot of players who can play in this league, definitely. It’s all just a matter of exposing our best athletes to the sport at a young age.”\\nWhile early exposure was the clear consensus to explain low representation, numerous players and coaches also cited a secondary, more controversial answer as another potential factor.And while it may be backed by some studies, Dr. Richard Lapchick, the director of TIDES in the DeVos Sports Management Program at UCF, characterized references to body types and genetics as problematic..\\nThe National Center for Health Statistics published a 2018 study showing that, on average, Hispanic men were shorter and weighed less than non-Hispanic white and Black men, based on survey responses. The data show that in 2015-16, Hispanic men aged 20 years and older weighed an average of 190.5 pounds, compared to non-Hispanic white men (202.2) and Black men (197.7) of the same age group.\\nOver the same span and survey sample, the results held for height, too. On average, Hispanic men (66.7 inches) aged 20 and older trailed non-Hispanic white men (69.8) and non-Hispanic Black men (69.1).\\n“I personally would stay away from those arguments,” Lapchick said. “Because, one, there’s no way to prove them, and, two, they just raise a whole lot of racially-charged biases. I think it comes down to this: If you’re a young, Hispanic kid in America and you’re trying to decide what sport you want to play, you look around and see role models who look like you, they probably aren’t going to be in football.”\\nTom Flores, still the only Hispanic coach to have ever won a Super Bowl, was the first starting quarterback in the history of the Raiders franchise, in 1960, when the team was in the AFL.\\nHe spent six seasons with the team and became the first Hispanic starting quarterback in professional football history.\\nFlores, whose parents were migrant farmers in Fresno, lived in a small home with no running water. His crib was a grape box. But it was his relationship with former Raiders owner Al Davis, developed over his years as a player, that put him in a position to set the standard in the NFL for Hispanic representation.\\n“Al treated me just like he treated anybody else,” Flores told USA TODAY Sports. “There was no favoritism. There was no racial bias. But there just weren’t a lot of Hispanic men playing or coaching at that level back then. It’s kind of like what Black assistant coaches deal with. Around 70% of the league is Black, and it’s still hard for qualified Black coaches to get hired. It’s a very slow progression. It’s a buddy system.”\\nAccording to the\\xa0TIDES report,\\xa0Hispanic or Latino assistant coaches represented just 1% of respondents last year, down from 1.7% in 2018. In head coaching positions, there are two Hispanics\\xa0among the league's 32 teams.\\nAnd in the history of the NFL, it is believed that there has been only one Hispanic general manager or director of player personnel.\\nThe one\\xa0to break that\\xa0barrier was Flores,\\xa0in 1989 with the Seattle Seahawks.\\nRon Rivera of the Washington Football Team,\\xa0one the two Hispanic head coaches in the NFL, still regards Flores as the paradigm and sees similarities from his own rise to\\xa0the one of the Hall of Fame finalist\\xa0for the Class of 2021.\\nRivera, whose father is Puerto Rican and whose mother is Mexican-American, played linebacker for nine seasons for the Bears and was a key figure in the historic 1985 defense that secured a championship in Super Bowl XX. He later joined the Bears coaching staff in 1997 as a defensive quality control assistant.\\n“Unfortunately, Hispanic and Latino coaches may have to work twice as hard,” Rivera told USA TODAY Sports. “But when you do get the opportunity, you’ve got to keep it and make it work for you.”\\nRivera pointed to the Bill Walsh Diversity Fellowship, a program that helps recruit minority and diverse assistants to participate in training camps as a tool to break in.\\nThe league also has the Rooney Rule, which has come under criticism but aims to increase external minority interviews for head coaching and other senior positions.\\nBut exposure – or lack of it – may fulfill a self-perpetuating cycle for Hispanic coaches. Since playing experience is such a seamless path toward NFL front offices, lower levels of Hispanic representation on the field may also be linked to lower Hispanic representation in coaching.\\n“We as a community, I think, don’t do enough to promote ourselves,” Rivera continued. “I would love to see a little bit more of that. Unless you really dig around, you really don’t find a lot about Hispanic people in football, let alone the NFL. It’s a shame, because we represent such a huge population inside the United States as a fan base.”\\nAccording to the NFL, there are more than 22 million NFL fans in Mexico, including more than 7 million avid fans. There are more than 40 million fans in Latin America, overall. The league is the second-most popular sporting franchise in the region, behind Liga MX, the top professional soccer league in Mexico. And about a third of the league’s Hispanic fans in Latin America are younger than 25.\\nEvery year since 2016, an NFL International Series game has been scheduled in Mexico City’s Estadio Azteca, a game that draws ratings in the country similar to the Super Bowl. NFL International amended its agreement to honor the game scrapped in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and has plans for\\xa0games in Mexico City in 2021 and 2022.\\nThe league has invested in a flag football program in Mexico that includes a partnership with schools to make it part of the physical education program. The league estimates that 5 million boys and girls played during the 2019-20 school year.\\n“We look at the game as a developmental pyramid, and at the base is flag football,” NFL International chief operating officer Damani Leech said. “That’s just getting footballs in the hands of boys and girls, increasing their familiarity with the sport. Our research says if you’ve played the game, you’re much more likely to be a fan of the sport.”\\nAt the top of that pyramid is the NFL’s International Pathway Program. Now in its fourth season, it allows some teams to carry an international player on their practice squad. The 2020 season marked the first that saw a Mexican player allocated to a team.\\nOffensive lineman Isaac Alarcón played college football for the Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey.\\nAfter Alarcón was allocated to the Cowboys, NFL International closely followed the reaction. His\\xa0Instagram followers grew 800% as the Mexican and Hispanic fans of the Cowboys saw one of their own wearing the iconic star on his helmet. It led NFL International to work with the Organización Nacional Estudiantil de Fútbol Americano, the major college football league in Mexico, to strengthen ties and increase player identification opportunities.\\n“We’re working on developing those plans now,” Leech said. “The reception from fans on both sides of the border has just been tremendous.”\\nWhile these initiatives could eventually produce gains, tangible progress may still be several years away. Current players and coaches insist there’s short-term work to be done domestically. The first step, Davis said, should be for teammates to seek out Hispanic players to engage in meaningful conversations that address the paths and obstacles they face.\\n“My teammates do know what Mexicans look like, how they speak and all that,” Davis said. “But it’s important for them to know who I am as a person, who Michael Davis is and what he represents, what his culture represents, the issues he has to face every day, the values that are important to him.”\\nBoth Davis and Villanueva said they weren’t in favor of any intervention to cater to any specific group to increase representation. Rather, players recommended investing in grassroots campaigns in communities with strong Hispanic ties in the U.S. to educate children on the values of all sports, not only football.\\n“I think America is more of an idea,” Villanueva said. “Americans are those who share that idea. You can bring in your background, your ethnicity, your culture. You can bring it into this country and be one more – as long as you hold those American ideals. The Hispanic population in this country has embraced these values.\\n“Football represents a lot of those values – individualism, toughness, perseverance. Once Hispanic people start embracing the game a little more, I think it’s only a matter of time before we see more Villanuevas on the backs of jerseys.”\\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes\\n\"},\n",

       "  'body': \"“I am a disaster relief worker.” Those are six words I never thought I would say.\\nWhat did it take to move me from empathy to action? Apparently, it took 2020. With the COVID-19 pandemic and multiple large-scale disasters impacting our country, this challenging year inspired me to find a way to heal my soul.\\nTwo weeks before historic wildfires broke out across my state of Oregon, I began taking online training with the American Red Cross to volunteer in times of disaster. At the time, I didn’t know if I had the strength to be part of an emergency response. But when devastating wildfires began to impact my community, I knew in my heart that I had to do something to help.\\nWhen I reported for duty in Salem, Oregon, on Sept. 9, I had no idea what to expect. As a first-time disaster volunteer, I wasn’t sure what I would be doing as part of this response. What I soon learned was that for up to 13 hours a day, I would play a supportive role to the people who lost so much. I worked directly with evacuees to help understand their needs, identified community resources available to them and found a safe place to stay for those who had been displaced from their homes. Dependent on the person’s situation, I coordinated a hotel room for them or directed them to a nearby shelter.\\nBorders can't contain climate change:California’s crisis is a world management issue\\nI spent a lot of time talking to evacuees and hearing their stories. Many people said they had no notice before needing to evacuate because fire conditions changed so fast. They were forced\\xa0to flee in the middle of the night with only the clothes they were wearing or what was in their car. Several people already knew they had lost their homes and had nothing to go back to.\\nThese conversations with evacuees were an emotional rollercoaster. One moment we might be choking up with sadness, and then we’d be laughing about something small and looking for the good.\\nThe happy moments amid the tragic circumstances will stay with me. I remember watching a dad and his son play and laugh inside one of the shelters. I remember the small puppy who brought countless smiles to evacuees. And I’ll never forget the look of relief on a person’s face when they knew they were not alone, and I was there to help them.\\nThere are also difficult memories that I’m still processing. People looking to make contact with family members. Seeing photos people had taken as they were evacuating or after the fire had gone through their area. One person told me they lost their house and their business but were already making plans to get the business up and running so they could help out their employees — their staff’s well-being was what was most important to them.\\nLouisiana:As my beautiful bayou home is ravaged by hurricanes, people of color become climate migrants\\nWhat I will remember most about my experience, and what still brings tears to my eyes, is how good it feels to help others. To share your strength with someone when they need it. To bring hope that they will get through this.\\nThis experience brought back my faith in humanity. It’s simultaneously one of the hardest things I’ve ever done and one of the best. I have discovered I have so much more strength and desire to help people than I ever thought. This is an experience that I will remember for the rest of my life.\\nTami Aalto is an Oregon resident volunteering with the American Red Cross in response to the western wildfires.

       "  'body': 'Meat packing company JBS helped take\\xa0away what our family treasured most: My mom. And then the government took more: our belief that every life matters, no matter how much money you make.\\nThe U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) cited\\xa0JBS last month for failing\\xa0to protect its employees\\xa0in Greeley, Colorado, from being exposed to COVID-19. The company’s negligence cost one corporate employee and\\xa0six workers at the plant their lives, including my mom, Tin Aye.\\xa0Another 290 workers have confirmed positive cases as of mid-September.\\nJBS denies it did anything wrong,\\xa0but my mother, who worked for JBS for 12 years,\\xa0was almost certainly exposed to COVID-19 in the Greeley meat packing plant, where she\\xa0worked long, hard hours to keep America’s grocery stores well-stocked, and an endless supply of meat available for summer grilling. It made me sick to hear OSHA only fined JBS $15,615, the maximum allowed. That’s less than $3,000 per death. My mom’s life is only worth $2,230?\\nMy mom sacrificed her whole life to give my brother and me a better future. Tin Aye fled persecution in her native Burma (Myanmar), only to land in a refugee camp in Thailand. My parents lived there for 12 years, and it is where we were born. They taught us that coming to the United States was the first step on the road to the American dream. It sure seemed that way when we moved to Colorado, and my mom started working at JBS. We had no idea what a nightmare it would turn out to be.\\nWhen the pandemic started in early March, I was 9 months pregnant. My mom was a healthy 60-year old working woman with no preexisting conditions, and excited to meet her first grandchild. Then one day at work, she started showing symptoms of COVID-19. When she went to the on-site clinic at JBS, they told her it was just a common cold, or a mild flu, and sent her right back on the floor. But as the weeks went on, she never got better. Wouldn’t a common cold have passed by now?\\nAt one point she asked her supervisor if she could take a break and go to the bathroom. He told her no. And my proud, beautiful, hard working mother urinated on herself. Soaked in urine, she put her head down and kept working. And all the while, the virus was wreaking havoc on her body.\\nCoronavirus:I lost my son to an opioid overdose. COVID-19 will only bring more deaths of despair.\\nYou wouldn’t have heard this story. After all, she was just a refugee-turned-meatpacker. You were more likely to hear a JBS executive claim that “since February, we have invested millions of dollars to implement hundreds of safety interventions, often exceeding guidance.” It sounds so much better than a sick woman peeing on herself while being told, don’t worry, you’re fine.\\nThe Greeley plant\\'s first positive COVID-19 case was confirmed on March 26. Workers were made aware in a rather informal announcement, delivered just before the line started. They had no time to ask questions, let alone leave. The message was clear: Keep working.\\nThey trusted the company to do its best to protect them, as the virus was silently spreading throughout the plant. My mom’s union leaders sent letter after letter to JBS, pleading with them to give the meatpackers protective gear. The company didn\\'t even implement necessary social distancing.\\nPatients left confused:Politics infected America\\'s COVID-19 response. People are dying because of it.\\nWhen the state of Colorado shut down\\xa0at the end of March, only essential workers were authorized to keep going to work. Americans might panic if there were suddenly no meat on the shelves. And yet, JBS still did not outfit workers with personal protective equipment;\\xa0did not clearly communicate that workers with COVID-19 symptoms should stay home;\\xa0and did not\\xa0spread everyone out at a safe distance.\\xa0What happened next wasn’t surprising: hundreds of JBS workers and their dependents\\xa0started flooding the emergency rooms and clinics in Greeley. They were sick with a deadly virus. My mom was sick with a deadly virus.\\nAnd JBS’ response? The company offered\\xa0workers a bonus based on attendance\\xa0and championed\\xa0a \"work while sick\" culture, as the county\\'s Department of Public Health and Environment described it on April 4. The county\\'s investigation even found that 64% of the workers who tested positive\\xa0had “worked while symptomatic and therefore were contagious to others.”\\nIt got so bad, state authorities were forced to temporarily shut the plant down.\\xa0\\xa0\\nI went into labor at the end of March. As a precaution, the nurses tested me for COVID-19 and I came back positive. Knowing my mom’s symptoms, I immediately gave her a call before I went in for an emergency C-section. The day after my son, Felix, was born, my mom was admitted to the hospital and almost immediately put on a ventilator. She would never come off it. My mom lost her battle with COVID-19 on May 17. She never got to meet her grandson.\\nI don’t enjoy telling our story. It hurts to remember. But the most painful thing is going over all the what ifs?\\xa0If JBS had closed earlier. Or cleaned the plant more thoroughly. Or gave the meatpackers personal protective equipment immediately.\\xa0Tin Aye, my mom, didn’t matter nearly as much as the bottom line.\\xa0\\xa0\\nBut I thought she would matter to the federal government, to the agency that’s supposed to make sure workers are protected, when they can’t protect themselves. OSHA’s $15,615 fine makes it clear: No one cares. Not JBS. Not the Department of Labor. Not the U.S. government.\\nMy mom was a meatpacker. It’s the kind of job where you come home dirty every night, dead tired. It’ll never make you rich, or bring you glory. But it’s the kind of job America was built on, the hard work of everyday people. My little brother is a Marine, deployed overseas. He’s willing to risk his life for his country. My mom never should have been forced to risk hers, especially for a company that doesn’t care about its people.\\nSan Twin is a\\xa0grocery worker living in Englewood, Colorado.\\n'},\n",

U.S. policy forbade ransom, and parents of all the hostages were generally encouraged to keep the cases secret. Some later came to view that as a move to prevent them from freeing their children on their own while also silencing\\xa0them from criticizing government efforts.\\nIn June 2015,\\xa0after widespread criticism over the handling of the hostage cases,\\xa0Obama unveiled new rules\\xa0that would essentially allow families to offer private ransom payments, though the federal government would continue to refuse to make such payments.\\nAfter Pence\\'s remarks on Wednesday night, Harris responded: \"First of all, to the Mueller family, I know about your daughter\\'s case and I am so sorry.

       "  'body': \"Over 46,000 Americans tested positive for COVID-19\\xa0on Thursday. Unlike President Donald Trump, many don’t have the ability to avoid close contacts or require that masks be worn by those around them.\\nThey were picking crops to put food on our tables, working in distribution centers, waiting tables, or in a jail or homeless shelter. There will be no news coverage of their exposure and no reporting on who is hospitalized or dies. COVID-19 is highly infectious. It has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and isn’t slowing down.\\nThose who take COVID-19 seriously and take every precaution possible are also frequently exposed to people who don’t. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Fox News' Chris Wallace were surrounded by anti-mask crusaders like Donald Trump and his family and staff, who may have been exposed them to COVID-19 at Tuesday’s debate. Who knows how many other people Trump and staff exposed at fundraisers this week, including one he did at his Bedminster golf course Thursday, after he knew he was exposed. Considering how many people each of the people he may have exposed have been in contact with, a highly contagious bug like COVID-19 can travel fast and far.\\nPresident Trump’s health should not be political fodder. Biological threats to the president of the United States are serious business. Taxpayers pay millions of dollars in security and Secret Service payroll to prevent such threats from ever reaching the president. His illness should not be politicized. There is a lesson, however, in his flouting of mask wearing, one of the easiest and most effective ways to lower our risk of infection, and in our consideration of our fellow citizens.\\nWhy do we suggest that people wear masks? You wear a mask because you don’t know if you have COVID-19. You wear a mask because you can’t possibly know if others have COVID-19. And you wear a mask if you have consideration for and care about others in your community.\\nTrump hit with COVID-19: Anyone can get sick. Anyone can spread the deadly disease.\\nFor the resident of the United States, mask wearing is important for much bigger reasons. If 80% of the country wore masks, tens of thousands of lives would be saved. Many of those who don’t wear masks are highly influenced by the president. He has the power with his actions to change the course of the disease.\\nThe president, First Lady and first family have an enormous opportunity ahead of them. They can use this moment the same way British Prime Minister Boris Johnson did. By telling the country they must take this more seriously, by wearing masks everywhere they go, particularly in the West Wing and close quarters. By no longer mocking people who follow public health guidance by wearing masks.\\nCOVID-19 ravaged meat plants: My refugee mother's life is worth more than the bottom line\\nTrump has always had the power to depoliticize the pandemic,\\xa0yet he’s chosen to politicize it and add to our divisions at every turn. A divided country is a self-defeating country in a pandemic. The continent of Africa with 1.3 billion people has only 35,000 deaths. What we are asking for here isn’t particularly high tech. It’s a piece of cloth and consideration for others. If the president can find those two things, we have a much better chance of preventing tens or hundreds of thousands more deaths.\\nAndy Slavitt is\\xa0board chair of United States of Care, host of the\\xa0In the Bubble\\xa0podcast and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

       "  'body': 'Losing Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was an incalculable blow for our country. For millions of other Americans living with cancer or in remission like me, the Supreme Court nomination of Amy Coney Barrett layers terror on top of our grief. I’m a stage 4 cancer survivor, and the Affordable Care Act saved my life. That very law now hangs in the balance, and perhaps our lives do as well.\\xa0\\nPresident Donald Trump promised in 2015 to nominate judges that would strike down Obamacare. Now he has chosen conservative judge Barrett, who leaves a paper trail of skepticism of\\xa0the ACA and court cases upholding it.\\xa0\\nBarrett opposed Chief Justice John Roberts’ reasoning in his 2012 ruling upholding the ACA in NFIB v. Sebelius, and praised Justice Antonin Scalia\\'s 2015 dissent in King v. Burwell, which contested the ability of low income families to access tax credits towards their health insurance as a part of the law.\\xa0\\nThe entire law itself\\xa0will come before the Supreme Court on Nov. 10. If confirmed in time, Barrett could participate in oral arguments.\\nTrump signed executive orders ahead of Barrett’s nomination claiming to protect people with pre-existing conditions, but they are worthless platitudes without the law to back them up. We need more.\\nWhen I walked into a doctor’s office as a healthy 40-year old with a nagging cough three years ago, I was blindsided by a metastatic cancer diagnosis (Hodgkin’s lymphoma). I began my journey through treatment, while having to fight for my care.\\xa0\\nThe day after my first chemotherapy appointment, Republicans in the U.S. House voted to repeal and replace major parts the Affordable Care Act and celebrated on the White House lawn. They rejoiced in their work to destroy the insurance that was keeping me alive, and, I hoped, would save my life.\\xa0\\nMuch of Republican animosity stems from how the Affordable Care Act is structured: The rich would likely\\xa0receive billions in tax cuts if it is repealed, according to a report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. They value tax breaks for the wealthy over our very lives, so they will keep fighting for repeal as long as they are in power —\\xa0if people need expensive care, they’re on their own.\\nStaying alive and protesting repeal:I\\'d be bankrupt or dead without the Affordable Care Act. We\\'re both survivors — so far.\\nEventually the overt repeal attempts failed, but they were not done. The Trump tax cut bill signed into law at the end of 2017 also removed the health insurance mandate fee portion of the ACA. This clause set up the case before the Supreme Court today.\\nHere’s what’s at stake if they succeed in dismantling the ACA: 133\\xa0million people with pre-existing conditions will be affected;\\xa023 million, including myself, could lose their insurance outright.\\xa0\\nMedicaid expansion\\xa0under the law would go away, leaving low-income families in the lurch. We could go back to the days of annual and lifetime limits for people with insurance;\\xa0women could be charged more for health insurance;\\xa0children would not be able to stay on their parents\\' plan until they turn 26;\\xa0insurance wouldn\\'t be required to cover the\\xa0free preventative care we all rely on today. The \"donut hole\" could reopen for seniors on Medicare with high prescription drug costs.\\xa0\\nAnd insurance companies could go back to picking and choosing their customers, selecting only the most healthy —\\xa0and dropping people via rescission, the retroactive cancellation of a health insurance policy, if they ever truly needed their insurance.\\nWe can\\'t go back.\\xa0\\nI\\'m one of the many millions who are essentially uninsurable without the ACA. I’m self-employed, and there is no Plan B. If my cancer returns, I will be bankrupt or dead without insurance. Even in remission, I cannot rest easy.\\nI moved to Colorado in 2019,\\xa0because I wanted to live in a state with good state-level fall-back provisions in case Republicans succeeded in their quest to end the ACA. But nobody should have to live like this, a health care refugee in our own country.\\nMisrepresented what Barrett wrote:Would Amy Coney Barrett really strike down Obamacare? What liberals misunderstand\\nMillions more will join us in fear of losing insurance as they go through COVID-19 — which could become\\xa0a pre-existing condition. We don’t even know yet what the longer-term health care needs will be for so-called “long-haulers,”\\xa0people with debilitating side effects after a COVID-19 infection.\\nOur government has completely bungled their handling of this pandemic, and\\xa0215,000 people in the United States have died from it to date. Now, the administration is trying to take away the health care of millions more as an encore.\\nTrump\\xa0and vulnerable Senate Republicans like my own Sen. Cory Gardner\\xa0are trying to whitewash their record on health care.\\xa0However, Amy Coney Barrett is a threat to our care, and every senator who votes for her needs to own it.\\xa0\\nInstead of passing another relief bill for the millions of Americans without jobs right now —\\xa0including my sister —\\xa0Trump and the Republican-controlled Senate are focusing on ramming through a court nomination over the objections of a majority of Americans.\\nI was honored to share my personal health care story with Joe Biden at the Democratic National Convention in August. Not only did he promise to stop the attacks on our care, but he promised to me to expand health care access with a public option.\\nNow more than ever, this is a health care election. This November, health care is on the ballot and on the docket. All our lives are at stake. As voters, what will our ruling be?\\xa0\\nLaura Packard is a Denver-based health care advocate, founder of Health Care Voices, a non-profit grassroots organization for adults with serious medical conditions;\\xa0serves as co-chair of Health Care Voter;\\xa0and runs the pharma accountability campaign for Hero Action Fund.

       "  'body': \"When a stone is thrown into a pond, it causes the water to immediately awaken. The initial impact is disruptive, as are the ripples that are closest to the splash. Like the ripples from the stone, we are scrutinizing videos and photographs from recent events to see what potential exposures might\\xa0have emerged from the White House cluster. The problem is that we are judging its impact as we have throughout the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States:\\xa0on the surface and only by who and what we want to see.\\nThe untold story of the White House cluster — the unseen ripples — are those individuals who were not photographed in the Rose Garden, but who keep the White House operational. They\\xa0are the more than\\xa0350 full-time White House employees. They are the 96 full-time and 250 part-time service staff who work in the executive residence, where the president and first lady live. They are butlers, maids, plumbers, florists, doormen\\xa0and cooks. They are the workers who perform duties that put them in close contact with the president and first family. These are the people who will be most impacted by this cluster, but who will receive the least attention.\\nAnd if the White House doesn't release a count of infections in its ranks, as it said it would, we will never know how many of them contracted the virus.\\xa0\\nGiving little attention to those most impacted by this pandemic is not limited to the coverage of the White House cluster. When shelter-in-place orders were enacted, the businesses\\xa0allowed to stay open were generally those that people able to work remotely needed to stay comfortable.\\xa0And when we present risks associated with different activities, it is nearly exclusively from the perspective of the “haves” rather than the “have-nots.”\\nWhen we talk about grocery delivery being the safest way to get food, we do not stop to ask, “Safest for whom?” When we explore testing strategies, we have given limited consideration to how testing can best serve shift workers who cannot get paid time off or transportation support. And when we give advice for those confirmed as positive to prevent onward transmission, we have paid limited attention to those living in multigenerational households, or who have to work to meet their basic needs or that of their families. Collectively, we have experienced this entire pandemic through the eyes of the people of means.\\nAnd now, we will judge the impact of the president’s diagnosis by the number of high-profile people who are or are not ultimately affected. We will gauge our response by how quickly those people were identified, tested\\xa0and isolated. We will congratulate ourselves by thinking we have done well when\\xa0in reality, we will have merely transferred the risks and burden of disease onto those who keep the White House (and society) afloat.\\nWe will not think to remember the doorman who was exposed repeatedly\\xa0but lives in a space too small to safely isolate from potentially vulnerable family members. We will not provide child care for the kitchen helper who might\\xa0also be the primary caregiver at home. We will not protect the job of the part-time gardener who falls ill and must take leave.\\xa0\\nCOVID-19 ravaged meat plants: My refugee mother's life is worth more than the bottom line\\nAnd the White House will not even complete an outbreak investigation, including contact tracing. Those of lesser means, and their contacts, are likely to suffer in silence.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThese people will suffer, like millions of other Americans, because we refuse to admit that their suffering is our fault. Despite clear evidence that Black and Latinx people are disproportionately affected by COVID-19,\\xa0we have done nothing to improve access to their health care. In fact, we have relentlessly tried to protect the status quo and, worse, take away affordable health insurance.\\nDespite evidence that people in congregate settings are at increased risk of infection, we have done little to expand affordable housing or improve shelter conditions.\\xa0\\nInstead, we threaten to end the eviction moratorium\\xa0and deny people entry to shelters.\\xa0Despite knowing that all people — regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation\\xa0or gender identity — are at risk of infection, we have failed to enact a comprehensive national strategy that includes rapid testing, contact tracing, paid leave, universal access to care,\\xa0and safe voluntary isolation and quarantine facilities. Instead, we have created a system so complex that those who are economically marginalized have given up.\\nWe are increasingly shaming and blaming those exposed and infected. Yet\\xa0it is we who have failed, not them. We continue to focus on how this epidemic affects us individually, not on how it affects us collectively. We have invested millions of dollars in\\xa0testing at colleges and universities,\\xa0but very little in\\xa0testing in homeless shelters, domestic violence shelters\\xa0and substance use treatment facilities. We have pulled our children from public schools instead of working to improve conditions for all students. We have moved ourselves from cities to suburbs\\xa0instead of reinvesting to improve the situation better for everyone.\\nAfter Trumps' diagnosis: Vaccine or not, COVID-19 isn’t going away\\nAnd while we continue to blame people for new COVID-19 clusters and float the idea of targeted lockdowns, we refuse to acknowledge that structural inequities and racism are actually to blame for the continued spread. We, as a nation and as individuals, only focus on the ripples that we want to see.\\nThe president has told America\\xa0not to be afraid, but\\xa0the news of his diagnosis should be our societal awakening. We cannot allow this news cycle to end when all of the high-profile names have been tested.\\xa0We must also follow the ripples into places below the surface where we do not and, worse, refuse to look.\\nDr. Joshua Barocas (@jabarocas) is an infectious diseases physician and public health researcher at Boston Medical Center and assistant professor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine.

       "  'body': \"This story was published in partnership with The 19th, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom reporting on gender, politics and policy.\\nEleonore Jordan Anderson, 32, was working for the Pacific Crest Trail Association when COVID-19 hit and canceled the seasonal work. It was too late to be hired by the United States Forest Service, but she was hired on as a qualified sawyer on her engine crew, she told The 19th in an interview on her “rest and recovery day” between fire assignments. Chainsaw in hand, sawyers are tasked with clearing paths for other firefighters to get through, and taking down hazardous, and dead trees.\\nFive years ago, Anderson fought her first fire, and has been on the ground for 25 since then, four battles taking place this year alone. She spoke to The 19th on the heels of battling the Lionshead Fire, which stemmed from a lightning strike and has burned more than \\xa0203,000 acres in Oregon, destroyed more than 200 homes and \\xa0was 15 percent contained as of Wednesday. She then headed farther south in Oregon to the Thielsen Fire for the next two weeks. So far, the blaze has spread across more than \\xa09,900 acres and\\xa0was 26 percent contained. Anderson doesn’t do much research about fires before she heads out — things can change so much within a day, anyway.\\xa0\\xa0\\nBut the lack of gender diversity in this work remains the same. Anderson says there were less than two dozen women battling the Lionshead Fire. Sometimes there’s one or two, oftentimes there’s none.\\xa0\\n“It’s tough, you know, but it’s also just part of the job,” she said. “I’ve always been in male dominated industries, whether it’s trail crew or fire. There’s a lot of things that aren’t accounted for, like the fact that your pants don’t really fit — they’re meant for guys. There’s just a lot of things like that, but it’s generally OK.”\\xa0\\nAnderson buys her own Nomex, or fire retardant pants, that are fitted for women, running her about $200, she said. It’s that, or take the waistless pants provided.\\xa0\\nSitting outside in Rhododendron, Oregon, where some friends provided her with lunch on her day off, Anderson frequently coughed and cleared her throat during the conversation with The 19th — all the smoke was making her feel tired. This record-setting fire season is like none other, she said. A million acres have burned in Oregon alone, and wildfires in California have razed the near equivalent of\\xa0Connecticut.\\xa0More than a half-million people have been displaced from their homes, others asked to remain strictly shut inside — all while the COVID-19 pandemic wages on.\\xa0\\n'Disaster fatigue':\\xa0COVID, hurricanes, wildfires, politics: 2020 is an American nightmare that's wearing us out\\nWhile Anderson loves her work, the nation’s reluctance to react to climate change has become “excruciating” for her to bear, especially taking into account the\\xa0divestment\\xa0the Forest Service continues to experience. The Trump administration’s most recent budget zeroed out some private forest management programs to the chagrin of forest leadership:\\xa0Two-thirds\\xa0of the nation’s forestland is on state and private land.\\xa0\\n“Every year, proposed and enacted changes to our budgets affect some of us, both professionally and personally, and they affect all of us in terms of our collective ability to care for the land and serve people,” U.S. Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen wrote\\xa0in February.\\xa0\\nThis was the subject of a recent exchange between California Gov. Gavin Newsom and President Donald Trump. The president maintained that Western states are to blame for the fires because they failed to clear the forest of dead trees and leaves. Newsom, however, pointed to climate change as the cause of the worst fire season in his state’s history.\\xa0\\nTwo of every three burned acres across California, Oregon and Washington was federal land managed by Trump’s administration, the Redding Record Searchlight\\xa0reported.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn conversation with The 19th, Anderson, one of the nation’s few frontline female firefighters (only\\xa012 percent\\xa0of wild land firefighters are women), discussed logistics, how COVID-19 has impacted her job and why the environment is on the ballot this November.\\nThis conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\\nThe 19th:\\xa0I’ve heard you clear your throat a few times. How’s the smoke affecting you?\\xa0\\nAnderson:\\xa0I remember when I started fire, I didn’t really know what to expect, and all they really give you is a shroud. I think they’ve tried respirators, they’ve tried those things, but when you’re working and you’re actually sweating you can’t breathe through those things. And so they’ve just kind of figured out, “Alright, when you feel sick, you just get out of there and trade with somebody else,” you know? Or like you kind of like duck your head in the truck if you can or something like that.\\xa0\\nSo usually that’s not usually the case?\\nFire season, there’s always smoke in the air. But this year has been particularly bad. The fires are getting more violent and aggressive — and a little out of control, clearly. We have a million acres that have burned in Oregon just in the last two weeks or something. But how it’s affecting me, I’m just getting headaches. I feel a little loopy. But, it comes with the job, you know. You just kind of deal with it.\\xa0\\nOn top of the worsening fires, how has the job changed because of COVID-19? Some of the symptoms you’re talking about also sound like how COVID presents. What are you doing to navigate this other emergency?\\nWe have a fire camp, right? Which looks half like a music festival and half like a refugee camp, usually. It’s just tents on tents on tents and maybe a shower caddy or something. And now they’re separating us into divisions, because when we’re out on the fireline you can’t really separate from your crew.\\xa0\\nDuring the briefing in the morning they have the things you need to do for COVID, like wear a mask when you’re at the briefing, wear a mask when you go to the bathroom, wear a mask at a fire camp or when you’re getting food or when you’re having any interaction with other people. And then at the very bottom, it just says “fireline excluded.” So which is just kind of how you have to do it. However, I guess we’re finding out that COVID doesn’t really spread outside, and especially in the smoke nearly as much. I’m from Portland — the protests in Portland\\xa0have not been spreading\\xa0[the virus] like people thought that it would. So, I’m not really scared. I think a lot of people are feeling pretty good about it. And maybe the smoke in our lungs makes it bad enough where COVID is like, “I don’t want anything to do with this.”\\xa0\\nWe’re doing the best we can. It’s still definitely a risk.\\xa0\\nWho do you call before you head out to a fire?\\nI call my mom and my best friend, and I call my dad. I just say I’m going to a fire, and I let my parents know which fire it is, where I’ll be, how big it is and, naturally, tell them not to worry — it’ll be fine. My best friend is really possessive. So I have to explain to her why I can’t hang out with her for two weeks — she’s like my boyfriend.\\xa0\\nIs there actually nothing scary about it to you?\\nJust like any job, there’s a lot of room for error. There’s an excitement that comes with fire that doesn’t come with other jobs. I feel like I’ve always been under people that really know what’s going on, they know their stuff, they have a lot of experience. I’ve never felt unsafe. But it’s one of those jobs that you just kind of have to accept that there’s a lot of room for error, and you can have incidents within an incident.\\xa0\\nDo you have a sense that this is a worse season than normal? Is this as bad as everyone is painting it out to be?\\nYes, it is. The fires have been getting more violent, more aggressive. This year has been particularly strange because of COVID. I might be speculating here, but I do think that we’re losing some experience levels. Some people that have been around for a really long time, our crew bosses, they’re afraid of getting COVID so they dipped out. There’s still a lot of experience there, but it has been a strange year trying to navigate that as well as forest fires.\\xa0\\nBut climate change is real, climate change is definitely real. The seasons are also getting longer. It used to be conducive for people to go to college in the winter and fight fires in the summer. But now, fires in California are going through November, sometimes later. So all the evidence is definitely there, and it is getting worse. It’s a shame.\\xa0\\nClimate change certainly is real, but it doesn’t change the fact that people treat it as a debate. How does that make you feel as someone who is literally fighting to protect the planet?\\nIt’s excruciating, like witnessing people with science slapping them in the face. And not just science, patterns and literal smoke filling your house right now, and it’s definitely because of climate change. I don’t want to say it’s bad forest management, because all of the forest managers want to do everything that needs to be done in the forest. But funding gets cut every year without fail. It almost doesn’t matter who’s in office, it’s just constantly doing more with less. Yeah, it’s excruciating to witness that.\\xa0\\nWhat made you want to fight fires in the first place?\\nI started doing backcountry trail work when I was 20 or 21. I was working in the National Park Service. I’m from Illinois. So I didn’t climb a hill until I was 21 years old, I’m pretty sure. And I came out here and I was learning about fire while I was doing backcountry trails because I was working in Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks. Sometimes a fire would break out, and it was scary. And so I was definitely interested in it, but I didn’t know that much about it from an employment standpoint. I just knew fire behavior is fascinating, fire science is fascinating, basic meteorology is fascinating.\\xa0\\nI got into it because I met my best friend when he was making the Pacific Crest Trail. And I was working on the Pacific Crest Trail and he was a rappeller out of eastern Oregon. He would rappel out of helicopters to fight fires. I thought that was so cool. And I moved back to Portland with him and he got me into it and helped me get a job. It wasn’t too different, they’re both male-dominated industries, you know? There’s an excitement that comes with fires that doesn’t come with trails or anything else, and I just fell in love with it.\\xa0\\nWhat made you want to have a career outdoors?\\nNaturally, I’m a conservationist. Fires very obviously are protecting resources, you’re also doing prescribed burns and doing things that Native communities did for hundreds of years. You’re clearing a trail so that people have the ability to access the wilderness and appreciate it because without that appreciation respect doesn’t come. Without respect, protection doesn’t come. I’m a hippie at heart. I spend all my time outdoors. I can’t imagine another life. I think it’s really important. We don’t have a lot of wilderness areas left; you don’t have a lot of resources as far as our forests left. Suburban sprawl is taking over. For whatever we have left, I will do this until the day I die.\\nIs there anything else you would want our readers to know, either about your line of work or about this crisis, or a combination of all that?\\nHelp us help you, you know? Vote for the party that is going to focus on climate change, Vote for the party that is going to help us help the forest. I’m getting tired of this Republican nonsense. Do less with more? I’m so over it. We need better forest management, we need more funding, and we need more focus on mitigating the risks that comes with fire. We really need to get the right people in office to like make these calls. It’s a bigger deal and it affects all of us like without our planet, without our environment like we don’t exist — we’re just hurting ourselves.\\nAlso, if they tell you to evacuate your house, you’re not going to save your house with a garden hose. It’s not gonna work.\\nJust take care of each other. Right now we have 500,000 evacuees in Oregon. If there’s something you can do, do it. People are getting displaced. Look out for each other. If there’s something you can do, do it. I’m doing all I can, but the second I get a chance like I’m gonna be donating money, and anything I can to the communities I’m involved with. We should all be doing that if we can.\\n\"},\n",

       "  'body': 'PENSACOLA, Fla.\\xa0– At the height of the flooding from Sally\\xa0Wednesday, an Escambia County Sheriff’s Office deputy took\\xa0a 21-foot boat off a trailer that belonged to a resident of the Bristol Park neighborhood in Cantonment, Florida, cranked the motor and ferried about\\xa0120 people safely to dry land.\\nCapt. Jeremy Small drove the vessel over asphalt, dodging staples of domesticity like mailboxes and minivans, through suburban streets.\\n“I asked the guy whose boat it\\xa0was if he wanted to do the driving,” recalled Capt. Jeremy Small. “He said, ‘No, sir.’ So, I cranked the engine and backed her off the trailer.”\\nEscambia County Sheriff David Morgan told the News Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network,\\xa0that Small’s heroism was symbolic of all the men and woman of the ECSO.\\nWatch:At least 1 dead after Hurricane Sally causes \\'catastrophic flooding\\' in Alabama, Florida\\nStorms Wilfred then Alpha form:Hurricane season 2020 has been so busy, we have to use Greek letters\\n“The actions of Capt.\\xa0Jeremy Small in the rescue of Escambia County citizens trapped in the floodwaters are just indicative of\\xa0all the men and woman of the Escambia County Sheriff\\'s Office who are prepared to give their lives if\\xa0necessary to save others, whether responding to a terrorist attack or a flood-ravaged county,” Morgan said. “Every day they are prepared to serve.”\\nAround 6 a.m. Wednesday, Small was in the ECSO’s vehicle garage in Pensacola when a call came in from the county’s emergency operations center requesting the help of a\\xa0high-water rescue vehicle, or HRV,\\xa0in Cantonment.\\nThe dispatcher told Small at least one family had already fled to the elevated safety of their home’s attic in Bristol Park. It wasn’t expected that a civilian or even standard-police SUV could ford the floods — and\\xa0the water was rising.\\nNo other sworn deputies were around. The only other person in the ECSO garage at the time who could possibly help him on the long journey over the water-locked\\xa0country roads to Cantonment was a mechanic, Chris Leverett.\\n“It was just what I felt was right,” Leverett said, about his decision to aid the deputy. “Trying to get people to safety was the right thing to do.\\n“Put yourself in their shoes. I just didn’t think twice,” he continued. “I just did it.”\\nThe ECSO’s HRV is a hulking vehicle with enormous\\xa0tires. There is a large cab with an extended bed in the back that’s ceilinged by canvas. A tan paint-job makes it resemble an Army transport.\\nLeverett drove. Small rode in the passenger seat as they set out for the floodwaters in Cantonment shortly after 6 a.m. as Hurricane Sally squalled outside, all around them.\\nOn Pine Forrest Road near the Silver Lake mobile home park, the road was flooded, and the water ripped around a stuck van.\\n“There was a guy in the van,” Small said. “So, we checked on him, and he was like ‘Nah. I’m good. I don’t want to leave my vehicle.’ It wasn’t real-swift water. We were like ‘All right, we got an emergency,’ and we head on.”\\nThe men turned on Highway 97, which took them all the way to the Bristol Park subdivision, and they found the situation much worse than merely a single family trapped in an\\xa0attic.\\n“There was water already up to all the doors of the homes that were there,” Small said. “About two streets into the neighborhood and the water, it was getting close to touching the tops of brick mailboxes.”\\nPeople started pouring out of their homes, trying to make it to the HRV.\\n“We’re filling the truck up as we went along the street,” Small said. “We hit the second cul-de-sac that was flooded. Got some more people there. There was a car, a Camaro, that was flooded with people in it. We loaded them up.”\\nGoing street to street, Small and Leverett would make short stops. Parking the HRV in waist-deep water, they exited the vehicle and used a runaway kayak they found in a yard as a makeshift stretcher to float those who were not strong enough to stand in the strong current\\xa0over to their big truck.\\nOn one street, Leverett spotted a family waiting for rescue in its boat parked in their driveway. The HRV drove their way. The family got in, but after driving about 20 more feet, Leverett told Small they had a problem.\\nThe HRV was stuck. The water had risen high enough that even the hulking HRV could no longer move — full of refugees and now they had\\xa0no way to escape the neighborhood.\\n“It was a pretty bad situation,” Small remembered. “Then, a guy in the back said, ‘You can use my boat.’\"\\nThe water had risen. It was chest deep with a strong current, and Small did not want to risk being swept under.\\nThe ECSO captain used the roofs of cars parked along the street to leapfrog back to the boat until he reached the last vehicle between himself and the vessel. The boat was too far away to make a clean jump. He’d have to swim several feet.\\n“Like I said, there was strong current. I was a little concerned about if I could make it or whether it would suck me under. I probably spent about a minute debating what I was going to do,” Small said. “I kind of took a leap of faith and dove over there and made it right to the boat.”\\nSmall has some experience with boating. But he said\\xa0he\\'s not an expert,\\xa0and driving the relatively large vessel in a strong current through tight spaces proved challenging.\\n“I probably dinged a couple of mailboxes and things,” he said.\\nRegardless, Small operated the boat back to the stuck HRV, loaded up with refugees and ferried them to the mouth of the Bristol Park neighborhood where the land rose, and the waters receded.\\nThen, he went back in.\\n“Chris and I made about 10\\xa0to 12 trips with an average of 10\\xa0people on each ride,” Small said of his and Leverett’s adventure.\\n“When we took them out of there — I mean, I was driving on asphalt — the road sloped up,” he said, “and I definitely was banging the bottom of the boat on the road near the opening of the neighborhood where the people were getting off.\\n“That man probably is insured,” Small continued. “I hope he has insurance, but I have no doubt that he’ll get it paid for somehow, and I’m glad he let us use the boat. Otherwise, I don’t know how those people would have been saved.”\\nSmall returned to Bristol Park after the flood had passed and saw the boat back in place, sitting perfectly on top of its trailer.\\n“I don’t know how he managed it,” Small added.\\n'},\n",

Right-wing vigilantes,\\xa0with police and federal allies, wreak violence on peaceful demonstrators\\xa0who have the temerity to say that Black Lives Matter.\\nInequality of income\\xa0and exposure to toxic chemicals has skyrocketed, afflicting people of color most of all.\\xa0Higher education has become a plaything for the prosperous, leaving the rest saddled with debt for decades. Science and medicine are trashed on behalf of crackpot theories that jeopardize the planet.\\xa0\\nThe Justice Department has been converted into a political apparatus to protect the Trump family. The Supreme Court has rolled back voting rights. And all the while the president, a lifelong grifter,\\xa0routinely caters to wealth, sucks up to dictators\\xa0and undermines the Constitution.\\xa0\\nYet many younger people bridle at voting for the Democratic Party. They\\xa0aren\\'t enthused\\xa0about former Vice President Joe Biden. They don’t like his Senate\\xa0role in the crime bill of 1994. They don’t like his past support of creditors\\xa0against debtors. They are skeptical about Sen.\\xa0Kamala Harris’\\xa0record as a prosecutor and California attorney general. They want \"Medicare for All.\"\\xa0They want a major revamp of the criminal justice system,\\xa0including reallocating some money from the local police to mental health and other community services that can help people cope with local troubles without violence (“defunding”).\\nFor most of my\\xa0adult life, I have demonstrated and campaigned against the\\xa0nuclear arms race and the Vietnam War; union-busting savage capitalism and a surrender to the fossil fuel industries; mass incarceration; retribution against the poor and most vulnerable. Both parties pursued policies that led to those evils. We have no illusions that the Democratic Party will satisfy all our hopes. We anticipate that, in a Biden-Harris administration, we will have to fight hard within the party to achieve a Green New Deal or more equality.\\nBut before we can address the gravest dangers, we must stanch the bleeding.\\nWe are talking about an election, not membership in a fan club.\\xa0We are not choosing saints or mates. We are choosing a field of action. Do progressives want to continue beating our heads against Trump’s walls — literal and figurative — or do we want the freedom to fight for reforms that, in turn, can open the way for deeper reforms? Do we want to choke, or do we want to breathe?\\nTrump and the Constitution:Trump isn\\'t first president to abuse the Constitution, but he\\'s gone so far we need a reckoning\\nMovements of outsiders gain most when they win the support — even the half-hearted support — of insiders. Even as big capital has fattened, the movements of the past half-century have made life more decent for large numbers of Americans:\\xa0African Americans, Hispanics, LGBTQ people, the sick and disabled.\\xa0The Democratic platform of 2020 is the most progressive in our lifetimes.\\xa0By contrast, the Republicans didn’t even bother to offer a program, just a promise to continue Trump’s march toward authoritarian rule in the interest of the plutocrats and those who believe that America is “a Christian nation.”\\nIf we are to have any real chance of addressing the systemic evils that now prevail, we must evict Trump and his toxic party from political power.\\xa0With Trump in power, we move toward a police state. In a Biden-Harris administration,\\xa0especially if the Democrats take control of the Senate and abolish the filibuster,\\xa0we get to breathe — and fight — and win.\\nWe won’t win every battle;\\xa0no progressive movement ever does. Victories once achieved have to be safeguarded, and nothing can be taken for granted. But what is certain is that if the Republican Party is permitted to go on ruling, those who are young today will inherit a world of grotesque inequality, melting glaciers\\xa0and rampant forest fires, criminality with impunity, racism without redress\\xa0and cruelty without cease.\\nTweedledee and Tweedledum? Liberal-left voters who disdained Democratic presidential nominee\\xa0Al Gore in 2000 prevented climate\\xa0sanity for decades and made possible George W. Bush’s horrific Iraq War, whose reverberations still poison the Middle East and drive millions of refugees into danger.\\nFaulty leadership:Trump \\'leads\\' like he\\'s still selling overpriced condos. And his happy talk is killing us.\\nThe catastrophes we now face are still more awful. The choice is real — between political death and political life,\\xa0between bleeding to death and beginning recovery.\\nJames Chaney, Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and the many others who died for the right to vote did not believe they were bound for the promised land. Neither did they believe their sacrifices were futile because total revolution was not nigh. Would they throw in the towel because a Republican-named Supreme Court rolled back the vote so bitterly won? A vote is not an endpoint. It’s an opening. Stanch the bleeding.

       "  'body': 'President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden swooped into the unlikely battleground of Minnesota on Friday for\\xa0dueling campaign events in which each argued he was the better choice to spur the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.\\nTrump told supporters at a rally in the northern part of the state that tariffs he slapped on foreign steel\\xa0and other executive actions\\xa0he took helped save jobs in Minnesota\\'s iron-ore mining industry.\\xa0Biden, he said, spent\\xa0decades as a senator and vice president sending U.S. jobs overseas.\\n\"If Biden wins, China wins,\" Trump\\xa0said at\\xa0Bemidji Regional Airport.\\nA few hours earlier, Biden toured the\\xa0Jerry Alander Carpenter Training Center in Hermantown, a suburb of Duluth, and called again for a $15 per hour minimum wage. He vowed to strengthen “buy American” requirements for federal contracting.\\nBiden has proposed to spend $400 billion during his first term to buy American products. He proposed to spend $2 trillion on infrastructure, and to retrofit 4 million buildings and 2 million homes to make them more energy efficient, which he said would create millions of jobs.\\nBiden said he would pay for his plan by repealing the Trump tax cut for individuals earning more than $400,000 per year and raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. In contrast, Trump proposed to reduce the capital-gains tax rate on investments to 15%, which Biden said would be lower than the rate on working wages.\\n“It’s time to reward hard work in America, not wealth,” Biden said.\\nThe candidates\\' visits coincided with the first day of Minnesota\\'s early voting period – either in person or absentee\\xa0– for the Nov. 3 election. Trump is vying to win a state Democrats have carried reliably since 1972 and therefore isn\\'t routinely mentioned among crucial swing states like neighboring Wisconsin, Michigan or Florida.\\nTrump has won support across the northeast region of the state, despite the Iron Range being a traditional Democratic stronghold of\\xa0unions for mining, steelworkers and shipping.\\nPolls suggest a comfortable Biden lead in Minnesota, by an average of 8.8\\xa0percentage points through Sept. 18, according to\\xa0tracking site FiveThirtyEight.com. While Trump won support in the Iron Range in 2016, the bulk of the state\\'s population is more urban and favors Democrats. But the Trump campaign says its internal polling portrays a tighter race.\\nAt his rally\\xa0in\\xa0Bemidji, Trump cast doubts on the polls showing him behind.\\n\"I don\\'t think so,\" he said. \"There\\'s no way I\\'m 9 points down.\"\\nIn a play for urban voters, the Trump campaign unveiled a local television ad Friday for Minnesota and Michigan that criticizes Biden for proposing to raise the number of refugees welcomed to the country from Syria, Somalia and Yemen. Minnesota had about 43,000 residents who were born in Somalia by 2018, according to census estimates, which occasionally\\xa0sparks tensions in the Twin Cities.\\nTrump warned supporters at his rally that Biden would flood Minnesota and the rest of the country with refugees from\\xa0“some of the most dangerous places in the world, including Yemen, Syria and Somalia.”\\n\"I\\'m your wall between the American dream and chaos,\" he said.\\nAnother urban issue for\\xa0the Twin Cities deals with racial-justice protests.\\xa0Minnesota has been\\xa0the epicenter of\\xa0nationwide racial justice protests, after the death May 25 of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. But political experts said the issue hasn\\'t appeared to influence presidential politics in the state.\\nCynthia Rugeley, an associate professor of political science at the University of Minnesota Duluth, said she sees no evidence that Floyd\\'s death or the protests are shifting the presidential race in the state.\\n\"I’m not sure it has changed any minds,\" she said.\\xa0\"It does seem to have hardened people’s opinions on the issues.”\\nTrump has called himself the law-and-order candidate, supporting police\\xa0amid concerns about public safety.\\xa0But\\xa0Biden has accused Trump of stoking racial division\\xa0rather than seeking to heal wounds from protests ranging from Portland, Oregon, to Atlanta, Georgia.\\nDuring Trump\\'s previous visits to Minnesota, the president promoted his tariffs on Chinese steel to bolster local mining, his renegotiation of the\\xa0trade deal with Canada\\xa0for dairy farmers and funding for the\\xa0Soo Locks shipping channel that is critical to trade\\xa0on the Great Lakes.\\nWhen Vice President Mike Pence campaigned in Duluth on Aug. 28,\\xa0six mayors from traditional Democratic strongholds endorsed the GOP ticket and said \"lifelong politicians like Joe Biden are out of touch with the working class.\" Three more Iron Range mayors endorsed the ticket Friday, saying the Obama administration when Biden was vice president was soft on China as mines shut down.\\nBiden has focused on his support among steelworkers and other unions, with a\\xa0proposal to spur\\xa0domestic manufacturing through federal spending. He\\xa0released a statement Wednesday supporting the\\xa0Iron Range and promoting\\xa0endorsements by unions including the United Steelworkers and AFL-CIO.\\nHe said steel shipments were\\xa0down 25% last year under Trump\\'s administration,\\xa0idling mining\\xa0operations and putting thousands of people out of work,\\xa0while\\xa0China produced the largest monthly volume of crude steel on record in July.\\nBiden acknowledged a chip on his shoulder at having the affluent look down him without an Ivy League degree. But he promoted the region’s union workers who built things with their hands rather than deriving income from investing in the stock market.\\n“I believe this campaign is between Scranton and Park Avenue,” Biden said, repeated a theme from his town hall Thursday on CNN. “Like a lot of you, I spent a lot of my life with guys like Donald Trump looking down on me.”\\nMinnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a former Democratic primary rival of Biden, said her grandfather was a miner whose job was made safer by miners.
