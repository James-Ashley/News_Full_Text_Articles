      "['The story of how Graham became so desperate for cash illustrates the expensive, toss-up battle to control the Senate and the energy around President Donald Trump’s pending Supreme Court nomination. Grassroots Democrats are hyperactivated to take on Republican leaders like Graham, who once burnished a moderate reputation but has aligned closely with Trump.  Even in a state like South Carolina — which hasn’t voted Democratic for president since 1976 and hasn’t elected a Democratic senator since Fritz Hollings won his final term in 1998 — it’s left even the best-funded Republicans in relatively safe seats drowning under a wave of Democratic cash that is cresting with the upcoming court fight.  What happened  Graham’s pleas have escalated over the past week since Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death, but trouble has been looming for the third-term senator for some time now. Harrison has outraised and outspent Graham in every fundraising period this year, and the polls have the candidates running neck and neck, despite Trump’s lead over Joe Biden in the state.  Harrison, the former state Democratic Party chair, brought in $14 million during the second quarter of this year, nearly lapping Graham’s $8.4 million. And the Democrat shelled out $11.8 million during that period, nearly double Graham’s $6.2 million.  Graham ended the quarter with $15 million in the bank to just $10.2 million for Harrison. But since then, Harrison’s fundraising has only picked up.  Harrison collected a combined $14.1 million from online donors via ActBlue, the Democratic-aligned fundraising platform, in July and August — more than his total fundraising for the whole second quarter, with a month to go in the third quarter. And Harrison’s campaign said he raised $2 million in 48 hours alone earlier this month, after a Quinnipiac University poll showed the two men deadlocked in the race.  Meanwhile, Graham — who once pledged that, just as he opposed an election-year Supreme Court nominee from then-President Barack Obama, he would oppose one from a Republican president — is set to play a key role in a new Supreme Court confirmation process, and Harrison\\'s money will likely keep flowing in.  Ginsburg’s death, and Republicans’ immediate insistence on filling the seat in the current Congress and before the end of Trump’s term, has supercharged Democratic fundraising. Harrison’s campaign declined to disclose how much he’s taken in so far — either in the week since Ginsburg’s passing or in the third quarter to-date.  What it means  Graham isn’t the only Republican being inundated by Democratic cash. The New York Times reported earlier this week that, just to the north, North Carolina Democratic Senate nominee Cal Cunningham had raised $6 million in the days after Ginsburg’s death — more than doubling what his opponent, GOP Sen. Thom Tillis, raised in the entire second quarter. And then there’s Sara Gideon, the Democratic state House speaker in Maine, who has been outraising endangered GOP Sen. Susan Collins for a year and is likely to see yet more money come in, even after Collins said she opposes Trump sending a nominee to the Senate before Election Day.  But Graham’s case is special. At the start of the election cycle, few handicappers gave Harrison a chance to knock off Graham, who has moved from premier Trump opponent and critic during the 2016 campaign to the president’s loyal ally and frequent golf partner.  Since he entered the race, Harrison has sought to exploit Graham’s shifting alliances, portraying him as inauthentic and power-hungry. And Graham’s flip-flop on the court appointment — in Oct. 2018, Graham said, “If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump’s term, and the primary process has started, we’ll wait ‘till the next election” before filling the vacancy — has opened him up to new accusations of hypocrisy.  But attacking Graham on the court at the same time he’s presiding over hearings carries some risk, too. It could remind Republican voters who might be skeptical of Graham that he’s the point person in the Senate for moving the nomination. While South Carolina is undergoing the same kinds of demographic changes that have brought neighboring North Carolina and Georgia onto the presidential battlefield, it still leans Republican.  Graham’s vulnerability is rooted in his weakness among more conservative voters, who recall his pre-Trump image as a moderate voice: the dealmaking friend of maverick John McCain who pushed immigration reform, voted to confirm Obama’s Supreme Court nominees and trashed Trump. With upscale white voters in and around Charleston and Columbia drifting toward Democrats, Graham now needs the skeptical conservative base to propel him to victory.  Graham has attacked Harrison as too liberal for South Carolina, linking him to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and hitting him for his previous work as a lobbyist. And his campaign notes that Harrison hasn\\'t been shy about promoting his website and urging supporters to give him donations, either.  In a six-sentence statement provided for this article, Graham campaign communications director T.W. Arrighi mentioned the URL for Graham\\'s campaign website five times.  “The mainstream media is one giant in-kind contribution to the Democratic Party,\" Arrighi said in the two sentences that didn\\'t include the address for Graham\\'s website. \"Jaime Harrison’s hollow campaign relies 100 percent on outside donations and ads because he is hiding from the issues.\"  What’s next  The end of the third quarter next week means we’ll likely hear from both men soon about their fundraising from July through September. Reports are due to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15.  In the meanwhile, Harrison’s boffo fundraising is giving him a massive advantage on the airwaves. According to Advertising Analytics, he spent $4.2 million on television this week alone — blowing Graham’s $1 million out of the water.  All told, Harrison has already spent $22.8 million and has another $15.5 million on the books, compared with $7.8 million spent and $1.9 million in future reservations for the incumbent.  “I am being killed financially,” Graham said on Fox News Channel in his first appearance of the day on Thursday. “This money is because they hate my guts.”  Harrison had a cheeky response on Twitter Thursday night: “Anybody else get the sense that @LindseyGrahamSC just realized he\\'s going to lose on November 3rd?”', '“Last night, I did what the corrupt media has refused to do,” Trump said. “I held Joe Biden accountable for his 47 years of lies, 47 years of betrayal and 47 years of failure. I held Joe accountable for shipping your jobs and dreams abroad and for bowing to the violent mob at home.”  “Joe Biden is too weak to lead this country,” he added.  The previous night, Trump spent the bulk of his time interrupting and interjecting as Biden and moderator Chris Wallace spoke. To some Trump aides, the president’s constant haranguing was positive because it allowed him to determine the terms of the debate and deflected attention from any serious policy discussion, including his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Several others in the Trump orbit thought the president’s persistent interruptions let Biden off the hook and didn’t give the former vice president the chance to potentially make gaffes or policy commitments he might later regret.  But to critics, the president’s performance only highlighted his chaotic style of leadership, which has turned off many independent, suburban and female voters this election year.  “We have a white supremacist in the White House who cares only about himself, who says he is about law and order but, I can guarantee you, is coming into my community, disregarding the laws of health and safety for Minnesotans,” Duluth Mayor Emily Larson said ahead of the visit on a call with reporters. “He parses out core information about a coronavirus pandemic at a timeline that he thinks works best for him. I am not about him. I am about this community. I’m about the state, I am about this country, and I am about Joe Biden.”  Trump’s campaign advisers, allies and even the president himself have long viewed Minnesota in 2020 as a potential toss-up, thanks to Trump’s support among rural white, noncollege-educated voters.  The last time the state went for a Republican presidential candidate was in 1972, when President Richard Nixon won a second term. Since then, the state has reliably supported Democratic candidates for president, and the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul remain bastions of progressive politics.  In 2016, 19 counties outside of the Twin Cities went for Trump, even though those same counties had supported Barack Obama in prior elections — lending credence to the Trump campaign’s idea of the state as one of the new battlegrounds.  Recent polls show Biden up by anywhere from 6 to 16 points in the state. The presidential contest is much closer in other battleground states, such as Florida, North Carolina and Arizona, but the Trump campaign still sees an opening in the northeastern part of Minnesota as the president tries to sway both rural and union workers. Roughly one week ago, Trump held a rally in Bemidji, Minn.  During the rally on Wednesday, Trump tried to portray himself as an ally of miners and other union workers. Flanking the stage were two long trucks filled with logs and adorned with signs reading “Make Logging Great Again.” Two huge American flags hung from cranes, and Trump spoke about his support for miners and the iron range in Minnesota.  \"They closed it up,” the president said. “As vice president, Joe Biden wiped out, he wiped out so much and that includes what he whipped out in the great state of Minnesota and we’re not going to let it happen anymore.”  President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally at Duluth International Airport, Wednesday, Sept. 30, 2020, in Duluth, Minn. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) | Alex Brandon/AP Photo  “But you know, they say it’s the greatest iron ore anywhere in the world and you should have it,” Trump added. “After I put tariffs on foreign steel, the iron range came roaring back. But the biggest thing I did was knock out his executive order. I knocked out so many of the things that he did.”  Though Trump tried to take credit for saving steelworker jobs, both Obama and Trump took action to protect the steel industry from foreign steel dumping in the state. Obama implemented tariffs on Chinese steel, and most mines that were shuttered during a 2015 downturn reopened before Trump was elected, Minnesota Public Radio reported.  The president spent the first portion of the rally retelling his version of the story in which he triumphed in Tuesday\\'s debate over Biden, whom he sought to cast as a socialist.  “I’ve got news for Joe: If you ever became president, you have to deal with some of the toughest people in the world, and Chris Wallace is very, very easy by comparison, I will tell you,” Trump said. “I know them all.”  “You know Biden lost badly when his supporters are saying he should cancel the rest of his debates,” he added. “With those ratings, they’re never going to let him cancel. You don’t know television.”  Biden\\'s campaign has committed to participating the next debate “under whatever set of rules the Commission develops to try to contain Donald Trump\\'s behavior.” The Commission on Presidential Debates announced on Wednesday that it would be altering the format of the debates to better control the participants.  The rally in Duluth was uncommonly short, clocking just under an hour on stage, and it hit on many of Trump’s popular themes of law and order and his support from law enforcement groups; his recent pick for a Supreme Court seat; and immigration, falsely claiming Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wanted to flood the state with refugees and inundate the state’s schools and hospitals with immigrants.  “What are they going to do when in eight, 12, 16 more years we hang it up?” Trump said, talking about how boring he thought politics would be when he left, and giving fuel to the idea that he would potentially try to serve for more than the allowable two terms.  ', 'An illegal alien has been sentenced to more than six years in federal prison for trying to pay a child for sex in Camden County, Georgia.  Alvaro Hernandez, a 36-year-old illegal alien from Mexico, was sentenced to 76 months in federal prison by U.S. District Court Judge Lisa Godbey Wood after pleading guilty to attempted coercion and enticement.  As part of the conviction, Herndandez must register as a sex offender and serve ten years of supervised release after completion of his prison sentence if he is not deported by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency before then.  U.S. Attorney Bobby Christine said in a statement:  Alvaro Hernandez was enjoying his illegal access to the American dream, living and working in rural Georgia, when he tried to pay for sex with someone he believed was a child. Our law enforcement partners helped protect our community from this predator by intercepting him during the perverted attempt.  According to court records, Hernandez was arrested in a child sex sting in April 2019 after messaging on the internet with a person he believed was 14-years-old. In the operation, Hernandez was offered sex for money by the 14-year-old and drove to a residence in Pierce County, Georgia, where he thought he would be meeting the minor.  Ten other men were arrested in the sting.  John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Breitbart News asked Marcus, one of hundreds of demonstrators, what he would tell President Donald Trump if given the chance.  Marcus replied:  I would tell [Trump] to work on the immigration situation. When it comes to black folks and immigration, it really hurts the black community when illegals come into the community. They go straight to the black neighborhoods. They don’t go into Georgetown, Beverly Hills, or places like that. We have to fight for those resources, so I think if we can really get a handle on illegal immigration, it would really help out the black community.  Marcus highlighted public education and the cost of housing as two areas negatively impacted by illegal immigration:  When you go into some of these schools in the inner cities, they’re always maxed out, because you have a lot of illegals coming to these schools and it’s taking up a lot of resources. So when you have a school classroom size that might have been meant for say, 12 or 13 kids who live in the neighborhood, now you bring illegals in, it pumps it up to 20, 25, and it’s hard for the teacher to teach that many kids.  “When it comes to resources [such as] welfare programs and things of that nature, it makes it kind of difficult for black folks,” concluded Marcus. “Housing is another thing, as well. It’s hard to find affordable housing, and when illegals come into the country, it messes up affordable housing.”', 'Migrants in Mexico awaiting U.S. asylum hearings torched an effigy of President Donald Trump.

Just read the signs, or in this case, the government-funded billboards scattered along Pennsylvania highways of “wanted” immigrants and threats of ICE raids in “sanctuary cities.” Or follow the money, which reveals an expensive campaign ad strategy that embeds Trump’s hallmark anti-immigrant dog whistles into his 2020 “law and order” messaging.  Despite the many distractions Trump manufactures, immigration is still very much a MAGA weapon of choice.  What becomes clear is that despite the many distractions Trump manufactures, immigration is still very much a MAGA weapon of choice. But unlike 2016, he’s brandishing that weapon in a more veiled and targeted way: under the radar of much of the national media, vis-à-vis nuanced messaging and targeted ads aimed at swing voters. More important, and unlike in 2016, his strategy is falling flat in the battleground states he needs to win.  The Trump campaign’s spending brings its strategic priorities into clear focus. Since April, the campaign has spent over $7 million on anti-immigrant Facebook ads alone, according to the marketing and communications organization Bully Pulpit Interactive. The campaign has also reserved more than $95 million in TV time this fall, targeting battleground states like Pennsylvania with ads saturated in fear-driven narratives around the left’s “radical” approach to immigration and refugees from “terrorist” countries. A new report over the weekend revealed that immigration was Trump’s second biggest TV ad buy from Sept. 1 to Oct. 15, only behind the topic of “China.”  This doesn’t account for other campaign expenditures pushing anti-immigrant messages, like the $10 million-plus YouTube campaign featuring Trump’s “Radical, Extreme, Left” ad that connects tax increases with undocumented immigrants. It also doesn’t account for the campaign’s direct mail strategy — which weaponizes amnesty as “evidence” of Biden’s embrace of the “radical left” — or the millions spent by groups like the America First Action Super PAC on anti-immigrant ads.  Trump isn’t sparing any expense on the issue. But he is massaging the message.  Despite eking out a victory in 2016, when Trump rallied his base by mounting an all-out assault on immigrants, the president quickly learned in 2018 that his primitive call to suburbia (under the auspices of a migrant “caravan”) no longer worked. And Republicans who echoed his message, like Lou Barletta, paid the price at the polls.  Hoping for a reprise but noting the voter pivot in 2018, Trump is currently employing his version of subtlety: relying on xenophobic tropes, dog whistles and co-opting his anti-immigrant sentiment with his broader law-and-order message. It’s reminiscent of Richard Nixon’s 1968 suburban campaign play.  Against a backdrop of dwindling support among female suburban voters, Trump is now trying to repackage and resell the same anti-immigration sentiment by fusing it into narratives about the \"radical left.” When you connect the dots, what crystalizes is a revamped immigration strategy — rooted in messaging that’s being deployed via highly targeted ad buys.  But here’s the rub: A lot of voters aren’t buying it.  Trump is now trying to repackage and resell the same anti-immigration sentiment by fusing it into narratives about the \"radical left.”  In a 2020 voter study developed in collaboration with Civis Analytics, a data science company, we identified nearly 6 million swing voters in Colorado, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin who moved away from the president and toward Democrats when targeted with values-based immigration content. These critical swing voters — whom we have dubbed “family patriots,” consisting of mostly white, male, noncollege educated suburban voters — are the very voters that Trump is banking on.  The findings of the voter study align with recent battleground polling by the Global Strategy Group that reveal a majority of voters support citizenship for Dreamers and undocumented immigrants, ending family separation and other pro-immigration solutions. The findings also align with what we’re seeing play out in real time — the president’s record and rhetoric on immigration are becoming major political liabilities, especially in the wake of recent horrifying revelations of the shameless implementation of a shrewd, cruel plan to separate children from their parents.  Despite the political backlash — even among voters he needs — the president has kept his foot on the gas, banking on a strategy stuck in the past. So while his anti-immigration message isn’t as brazenly front-and-center as it was in 2016, Trump’s re-election strategy is still grounded in the same cruelty that has underpinned his presidency.  The only difference is that in 2016 he connected the dots for us. This time, we have to do it ourselves.', 'BAKER’s imprint on the JUDICIARY — JURY TRIALS to RESUME — Students waiting on LAPTOPS in BOSTON Presented by Public Transit Public Good Coalition  GOOD MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS. TGIF!  BAKER\\'S BROAD POWER ON BEACON HILL— Gov. Charlie Baker\\'s influence in Massachusetts government will become even broader by the end of the year. After the unexpected death of Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Ralph Gants, it\\'s likely that Baker will soon be in a position to select the entire bench of the Supreme Judicial Court.  The last governor to appoint the entire court was John Hancock, according to the Boston Globe , who was the first and third governor of the Bay State.  Baker has already named five justices to the seven-member court during his time as governor. Baker will fill Gants\\' seat on the court, and another spot on the bench when Justice Barbara Lenk retires later this year. The Governor\\'s Council approves Baker\\'s appointments to the court.  Naming the entire SJC would be a long-lasting example of Baker\\'s power as governor, as justices are not required to retire until they are 70. Baker\\'s youngest appointment, Justice Kimberly Budd, will be 70 in 2036.  This comes as the court is deciding whether Baker\\'s other big area of influence — executive orders — are legal. The governor has issued dozens of executive orders to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic, having to do with travel restrictions, facial coverings, flu shots and a host of other issues. Eighty-one percent of Massachusetts residents approve of how Baker has handled coronavirus, according to a poll conducted in June.  The Supreme Judicial Court heard arguments last week in the lawsuit brought by business owners and others. The issue is not whether Baker\\'s decisions were good or bad, but whether he should have relied on the Civil Defense Act for his authority. Justices seemed wary of upending Baker\\'s Covid-19 response, according to CommonWealth Magazine .

Follow us on Twitter Stephanie Murray @StephMurr_Jour', 'Latino civic and advocacy groups have joined in the outpouring of sympathy over the passing of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The pioneering jurist died at her home in Washington on September 18 at 87. On the Court since 1993, Ginsburg was long a defender of the legal, civil, and constitutional rights of Latinos and immigrants.  Domingo Garcia, national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, said, ”One of Justice Ginsburg’s greatest legacies was that she understood and greatly respected the spirit of the law as much as the letter of the law. She was well aware of her place in history as one of the voices for the excluded, the oppressed, and those trying to find real justice in our courts.” Garcia called upon the president and the senate to wait until 2021 before nominating a new justice.  On Twitter, Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Texas), wrote, “Our nation has lost a giant. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a pioneer and trailblazer who fiercely advocated for gender equality and women’s rights. The life and legacy of the Great Dissenter will forever be celebrated and honored in American history.”  The Hispanic National Bar Association, in its statement, called Ginsburg “a legal giant” and “a fervent defender of civil liberties and civil rights... and a bridge-builder on our nation\\'s highest court.”  Other advocacy groups, such as Latino Victory Fund, and Voto Latino, also expressed sadness over Ginsburg’s passing. Los Angeles Times columnist Gustavo Arellano wrote that the best way to honor the late justice’s legacy would be to show up and vote on November 3.  In 2019, Ginsburg was a key vote in the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision to block the Trump administration from adding a citizenship question to the Census. She also joined with the majority in cases involving the Affordable Care Act (2015) and same-sex marriage (2015), two landmark rulings that impacted millions of Latinos and other Americans.  Ginsburg penned a fiery dissent in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), which dismantled a key provision of the Voting Rights Act mandating that southern states get federal approval before changing voting laws. \"Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet,” she wrote.  The Shelby County case has had significant implications for Latinos and other communities of color, as it resulted in new rules and restrictions on voting—which can be viewed as attempts at voter suppression.  On immigration, Ginsburg’s opinions reflect a consistent concern for the rights of migrants, including immigrant detainees. In June 2020, she sided with the Court’s majority in DHS. v. Regents of the University of California, finding that the Trump administration had improperly terminated the DACA program (which grants deportation relief to certain young immigrants). In Arizona v. U.S. (2012), Ginsburg again sided with the majority, this time striking down three provisions in Arizona’s SB1070, the state’s controversial “papers, please” law. In Demore v. Kim (2003), Ginsburg was in minority, arguing against lengthy mandatory immigrant detention. In Zadvydas v. Davis (2001), she joined with the majority in finding that the government could not hold immigrant detainees indefinitely if their home countries refused to accept their repatriation.  “Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a fierce trailblazer in the fight for women’s equality and a champion for justice. I join freedom fighters everywhere in mourning her passing,” said Greisa Martinez of United We Dream, the country’s largest immigrant youth-led network, in a statement. “You will be missed, but your impact and legacy will be far reaching. We will continue to honor your legacy with our work. ¡La lucha sigue! The fight continues! Rest in power, Justice Ginsburg.”  Justice Ginsburg, who served on the high court for 27 years, was herself a daughter and granddaughter of immigrants. Her father was a Jewish immigrant from Russia. Her mother was of Austrian-Jewish background.  In 2018, speaking at a Naturalization Ceremony in Washington D.C., Ginsburg noted that immigrants have historically been on “the vanguard” of the fight against discrimination. “We are a nation made strong by people like you,” she said, ”people who travelled long distances, overcame great obstacles and made tremendous sacrifices, all to provide a better life for themselves and their families.”  Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.', 'Refugee reporters document the aftermath of the devastating Moria fire, and other tragedies, on troubled Greek island.  Lesbos, Greece – In the wake of the fire that destroyed large parts of the Moria refugee camp, a group of former residents have been documenting the aftermath.  The students of ReFOCUS Media Labs, co-founded by Douglas Herman and Sonia Nandzik, have been chronicling life on the ground in Moria for the past year.  “Our programme has always been focused on their futures, to take them out of Moria both physically and mentally for as long as possible each day,” said Herman, who has also made a feature-length film with his students.  “We never intended to have them use these skills to document their daily misery. But the fascism, the pandemic, and now the indifference following the fires have left us all with no choice but to report no matter what. As mainstream media slowly shifts away from Lesbos, our collective hope is that they are not forgotten all over again.”  In recent weeks, the journalists have been reporting non-stop.  Their stories had focused on life under lockdown in the Moria camp, until the most recent fire.  As Greek police frequently denied the press access to some areas, the students, equipped with cameras and phones were often the only ones left to document.  “When Moria was gone by the fire, we came to the streets,” said Mustafa Nadri, a student journalist from Afghanistan.  “For many days, journalists were not allowed to even get close to the area, so ReFOCUS citizen journalists were the only group reporting from the protests.”  The ability to report from these places, often inaccessible to other international media, comes with its own risks, said Nadri.  “If an international journalist has an issue with the police, they can get a lawyer, but what about us? We have no one to help us but we report anyway because we have to.”  In this photo by Yaser Akbari, a refugee journalist, people protest after the fire that reduced Moria to ashes [Yaser Akbari] Yaser Akbari, a member of the team, said there is a noticeable gap in coverage when journalists only stay on the island for short periods of time.  “A major issue for us is the lack of connection between journalists and refugees. They’re just here to take some photos, some videos, then leave. We live this every day, and we see this all the time. It would be more impactful and powerful if they actually knew who they were photographing.”  The refugee students are aware of issues of photography and consent; they never take photographs of children although they often see other journalists freely pointing their cameras at children.  But Mohammed Ali, another student, acknowledges that international reporters also play an important role.  “After Moria burned we were in the streets for nine days. I saw many journalists trying to show the world what was happening. At first, we feared the new camp would be closed, but we are allowed to leave and go shopping. I think the many journalists that came here and worked very hard to show our problems, they are why we are not locked away in a prison.”  Roxani Krystalli, lecturer in the School of International Relations at the University of St Andrews, said refugee-owned narratives are important to show the breadth of the experience.  “A key issue is that much humanitarian, journalistic, and academic interest in the lives of refugees centres on their experiences of violence, loss, and trauma. While those are significant, refugees also have stories of joy and care – and many refugees want to narrate those because they are as true a part of their experience as their losses. Centring refugee voices can allow for a fuller, more textured story of the refugee experience to emerge beyond the single narrative of violation.”  The images and videos taken by the team have largely focussed on the strength and resilience of the refugees themselves.  Many of Herman’s students are now living in a new temporary camp, Kara Tepe, termed by some “Moria 2.0” – and they will continue reporting.  “When I’m working with the media and reporting on these issues I feel like a messenger who can show the world the situation of the people here,” said Yaser Taheri, another member of the team. “It is a heavy responsibility yet it makes me feel free.”', 'A federal judge has given the Trump administration until Sept. 28 to stop the practice of holding immigrant children in hotels for prolonged periods under a secretive policy that rapidly expels undocumented immigrants who arrive at the border amid the coronavirus pandemic.  U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee denied on Monday the Trump administration\\'s request to put on hold her original Sept. 4 order to end the practice while an appeal is pending, reports the Arizona Republic, which is a part of the USA TODAY Network.  The Trump administration has been holding hundreds, and possibly thousands, of immigrant children in hotels in Phoenix and several other cities under emergency pandemic measures implemented in March to quickly expel undocumented immigrants, including children. In the past, immigrant children were transferred to state-licensed supervised shelters and provided a chance to apply for asylum.  \\'Be vigilant\\':Hotel group condemns Trump administration\\'s use of hotels to hold migrant kids  Gee ruled Sept. 4 that the government\\'s detention of children longer than 72 hours violated the decades-old Flores settlement that governs the treatment of immigrant children in custody. She had ordered the Trump administration to stop holding immigrant children in hotels as part of the policy by Sept. 15, with limited exceptions, but the practice has continued while the Trump administration sought stays pending an appeal.  A review of federal court records by The Arizona Republic shows that a total of 660 immigrant children were held at 26 hotels between April 18 and July 31 as part of a Trump administration policy to expel undocumented immigrants rapidly. The hotels were located in Phoenix; in El Paso, McAllen, Pharr, Houston and San Antonio, Texas; and in Alexandria, Louisiana, court records show.  Of the 660, 577 of the children were minors not accompanied by parents.  The data was included in court records filed by the National Center for Youth Law and the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, plaintiffs in the Flores settlement case, based on data provided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. An analysis by the National Center for Youth Law of the ICE data provided by ICE found several inconsistencies, including discrepancies in the dates some children were held in hotels and more alarmingly discrepancies in which cities they were held, court records show.  “The fact that the government cannot seem to consistently keep track of how many children it has held in its custody is disturbing, to put it mildly. It is emblematic of the problem with such an opaque, unregulated, ad hoc program,” Gee wrote in the Sept. 21 order.  The children ranged in age from 3 months to 17 years and were held in hotels as long as 29 days by a private contractor, MVM Inc., working for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, court records show.  Many of the immigrant children held in hotels during that period have already been expelled, the records show.  The court records show that more hotels in Phoenix were used to hold immigrant children than was previously known. They also show how many children were held in each hotel.  Of the 660 immigrant children held in hotels, 124 were held at three hotels in Phoenix.  Of the 124 immigrant children held at hotels in Phoenix, the vast majority, 121, were held at the Hampton Inn Phoenix-Airport North hotel on 44th Street near Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. That is the second highest number of children held at any one hotel during that period, according to the court records.  Two immigrant children were held at the Crown Plaza Phoenix Airport hotel on Washington Street during that period, the records show, and one child was held at an unnamed hotel in Phoenix listed in court records only as \"hotel.\"  Previously, it was only known that immigrant children were held at the Hampton Inn Phoenix-Airport North hotel. The number of children held there also previously was not known.  The 121 immigrant children held at the Hampton Inn Phoenix-Airport North was the second highest total behind the Hampton Inn and Suites in McAllen, where a total of 339 immigrant children were held during that period, court records show.  Owners of the Hampton Inn Phoenix-Airport North and the Crown Plaza Phoenix Airport hotels did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, a critic of holding immigrant children in hotels, said the 124 immigrant children held in Phoenix shows the scope of the program is larger than the federal government has acknowledged.  \"I\\'ve spoken to the federal government and they claimed this was a very small program. Your reporting indicates that it\\'s much larger than I was led to believe,\" Gallego said.  Gallego wrote to Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf asking for information about the program after the Associated Press first reported that hotels in Phoenix, El Paso and McAllen Texas had been used to hold immigrant children.  Wolf said during a Senate hearing in August that the practice of holding immigrant children in hotels was ongoing and said DHS officials would provide information about the practice to Phoenix officials. That has not happened, Gallego said.  \"This is a very significant program and we are not getting the information we need. Given the magnitude of the program it could look like human trafficking,\" Gallego said. \"The hotels are not set up to provide the necessary security for children including accountability of who enters their rooms when they are alone.  \"Children should be kept in facilities that were designed for this purpose,\" Gallego said. She noted that there are state-licensed facilities that have been used to house immigrant children in the past available in Phoenix.  The facilities \"had many beds open during this time period. I\\'m very concerned about this program. It needs to end,\" Gallego said.  Owners of the Hampton Inn Phoenix-Airport North and the Hampton Inn and Suites in McAllen where the bulk of the immigrant children were held early have said they have ended contracts and had stopped allowing immigrant children to be held at the two hotels.  The total number of immigrant children who have been held in hotels since the Trump administration implemented the emergency COVID-19 policy is not known.  \"The government’s detention of children in unlicensed and unmonitored hotels presents a significant risk of harm to these children, as children are supervised by private contractors who do not have licensure or appropriate training in children’s development, trauma, or legal rights,\" said Melissa Adamson, an attorney at the National Center for Youth Law.  \"The government’s detention of children in unlicensed and unmonitored hotels is particularly egregious given that there are over 10,000 available licensed beds in ORR shelters,\" she said.  At least 147,601 immigrants who arrived at the southern border without documents have been expelled under the policy, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. Of those, least 8,800 immigrant children have been expelled, court records show.  In denying the Trump administration\\'s request for a stay, Gee, the judge, rejected the Trump administration\\'s argument that holding immigrant children in hotels to expel them quickly protected the public and others from the spread of COVID-19 at state-licensed facilities operated under contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement.  Holding immigrant children in hotels, on the contrary, poses just as much a risk, while also exposing children to unsupervised and potentially traumatic conditions, Gee wrote.  \"Defendants have failed to demonstrate how hotels, which are otherwise open to the public and have unlicensed staff coming in and out, located in areas with high incidence of COVID-19, are any better for protecting public health than licensed facilities would be.” Gee wrote, citing the Sept. 4 order. \"Not only are the minors and their families potentially endangered by hoteling, but so are (ICE contract) personnel, hotel staff, and other guests that stay at the hotels.\"  Reach the reporter at daniel.gonzalez@arizonarepublic.com or at 602-444-8312.

Brussels on Friday confirmed an E.U. mission had arrived in Caracas as part of an effort by the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, to secure “minimum democratic conditions” for upcoming legislative elections. The U.S.-backed opposition led by Juan Guaidó is boycotting the December vote, which it argues will be manipulated and used by Maduro to consolidate power. The U.S. has also called for a boycott.  The Europeans have said the elections as currently organized would not meet minimum democratic conditions. But they’ve been in talks with Maduro’s government and dissenting members of the opposition on a way forward.  To nudge all sides toward agreement, the E.U. team, led by Enrique Mora, the bloc’s deputy secretary general for political affairs, and Javier Niño Pérez, its leading diplomat on the Americas, met separately with Guaidó and with senior representatives of Maduro’s government over the weekend. They proposed a suspension of the December vote for at least six months, during which time a European negotiating team would try to secure the minimum standards needed to allow E.U. monitors to observe and potentially lend international legitimacy to the vote.  Guaidó said the opposition was informed of the E.U. visit 24 hours before the mission arrived. In a statement to The Post, he maintained his position that “postponing a fraud does not make it less of a fraud.”  The United States and more than 50 other nations consider Maduro illegitimate. They recognize Guaidó as Venezuela’s rightful leader.  Abrams said Borrell devised the E.U. mission without consulting Washington, individual E.U. member nations, the Venezuelan opposition or key Latin American countries.  “It’s not useful to have Borrell’s office working on its own,” Abrams said. “It’s fair to call it cowboy diplomacy.”  Abrams said Borrell, a longtime socialist politician in Spain who became the E.U.’s top diplomat late last year, could be eager to reach a deal with Maduro for domestic political reasons and warned that he might lower the bar for a free and fair vote.  “If the regime agrees to postpone [the election] and does so in a deal with Borrell to get European monitoring, [Borrell] won’t want to fail,” Abrams said. “He will want to succeed, and therefore he will be inclined to accept regime excuses and accept conditions that are unacceptable in a democracy.”  An E.U. spokeswoman said the mission had “nothing to do with Spanish politics.” She said Borrell moved forward after receiving backing from members of the International Contact Group, a cluster that includes Mexico, Uruguay, Costa Rica and some European nations. Individual E.U. member states, the spokeswoman said, were informed of the mission before its departure.  “We believe there is a window of opportunity to support a peaceful and democratic transition in Venezuela,” she said.  A senior member of the opposition, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues, said Guaidó was advised of a possible mission on Wednesday, but was not told it was happening until after the team had left for Venezuela on Thursday.  The Europeans met with Guaidó on Friday before holding two rounds of meetings with senior Maduro officials including former communications minister Jorge Rodríguez, Miranda state governor Hector Rodríguez and foreign minister Jorge Arreaza. E.U. officials told the opposition that Maduro’s side appeared reluctant to postpone the vote, but held out the “tiny” possibility of a delay.  Abrams said U.S. assessments suggest Maduro’s government is divided on whether to postpone a vote. The senior Venezuelan opposition figure said the E.U. should have told the opposition of its mission sooner, but the opposition had “confidence” the Europeans would not seek a deal with Maduro that did not address their five key demands for free elections, among them a new electoral council and permission for all barred opposition politicians to run.  The spat between the E.U. and the United States, the official said, left the Venezuelan opposition in an awkward position.  “I do think that there is a component of the [European] mission that is anti-U.S., but we need the E.U. and we need the U.S.,” the opposition official said. “They should not put us in the position of having to choose. It’s like we are the kids and the parents are fighting.”', \"A failed asylum seeker has been jailed after committing a “frenzied and calculated” knife attack on a woman in a bid to prevent her deportation from Britain.  Awa Zongo, 29, poured a pan of boiling hot water over her housemate and stabbed her 30 times in an “unprovoked” assault in December last year, just two days before her deportation from Britain was due.  Manchester Crown Court heard that the defendant kept shouting “I’m not going back” as she launched the almost deadly attack on Asam Panahandeh at their home in Wigan, with doctors describing as “miraculous” the fact that the victim survived.  Zongo, who arrived in Britain from Burkina Faso in January 2019, sought entry to the nation as a visitor but was refused and placed in an immigration detention centre, according to the Manchester Evening News.  It reports that she was due to be removed from the country two days later but was taken off her deportation flight after becoming “uncooperative and unmanageable” and allowed to seek asylum and given accommodation at British taxpayers’ expense.  Even as More Migrant Boats Land, 40,000 Un-Deported Failed Asylum Seekers Remain in UK https://t.co/GdpczhVa5p — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 27, 2019  Prosecutor Joe Boyd said Zongo began to experience mental health problems in December after she learned that her asylum claim had been rejected and that, having exhausted her appeal options, she would be deported on the 16th of the month.  Emergency services were called to the defendant’s address, where they found Panahandeh in critical condition with a knife lodged deep in her neck, with just the handle sticking out.  The 40-year-old victim required surgery to remove the blade and had suffered 30 stab wounds to her neck, chest, stomach, and thighs, and also had burns covering her face, shoulder arm and back.  After plunging the knife into her housemate’s neck — an attack which only narrowly missed severing a lethal artery — Zongo left her for dead.  When arrested by police on suspicion of attempted murder, she claimed she had not intended to kill Panahandeh and had no memory of the morning’s events.  Report: Glasgow Stabber 'Very Hungry' Sudanese Man, Migrants Unhappy with 'Culturally Inappropriate' Spaghetti, Mac and Cheese Meals at Hotel https://t.co/uFjJ9zGfJh — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 27, 2020  Representing Zongo, Steven Swift claimed his client’s life had been “blighted by physical and sexual abuse” in Africa, where she had moved between a number of different countries with cultures “where violence and sexual exploitation became the norm for her”.  “These circumstances do appear to have impacted upon her,” he told the court, before claiming that a psychiatrist had reported that Zongo appeared to be suffering symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) triggered by the rejection of her asylum application.  But Judge Patrick Field QC rejected the defence’s claim that PTSD had played a major role in the “merciless attack”, telling Zongo it appeared “that your sole purpose was to prevent your lawful removal from this country”.  “No other explanation has been offered… If, therefore, this was your motivation it was particularly calculated, cynical and, frankly, wicked,” the judge said.  “You acted in a deliberate and calculated manner,” he told Zongo, adding that: “Whatever your motivation, what happened on December 14 demonstrates that you are a particularly dangerous offender.”  Despite this strong rhetoric, however, he sentenced the migrant to a minimum term of just seven years.  'Hundreds' Break Coronavirus Rules to Attend Funeral of Glasgow Knife Rampage Migrant https://t.co/wg5pIYAZaQ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 19, 2020\", 'An illegal alien has been charged with raping a child in Cherokee County, North Carolina, local law enforcement officials confirm.  Benito Morales Mendez, a 39-year-old illegal alien, was arrested by the Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office on statutory rape charges after allegedly fleeing to Texas in an attempt to evade arrest.  In January, a complaint was filed alleging that Mendez had sexually assaulted a child. Officials also alleged he violated a domestic violence protective order before issuing a warrant for his arrest.  Mendez, officials allege, fled North Carolina for Texas. In cooperation with the United States Marshals Service and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), officials were able to locate Mendez in Texas months after the arrest warrant was issued.  Since locating Mendez, law enforcement secured his extradition back to North Carolina where he is now in local custody on $500,000 bail. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has placed a detainer on Mendez so that if he is released at any time, he will be turned over to their custody for arrest and deportation.  North Carolina’s illegal alien population has ballooned in recent years thanks to its multiple sanctuary jurisdictions that shield illegal aliens from arrest and deportation. In 2019, more than 500 illegal aliens were released in the state by sanctuary jurisdictions.  As Breitbart News reported, up to 80 percent of criminal illegal aliens freed back into American communities by sanctuary jurisdictions go on to commit more crimes, an ICE official confirmed in congressional testimony.

Some days, her job is to stitch tags or labels for clothes that carry the proud slogan \"Made in America\" or \"Made in LA.\"  \"Those pay you around 3 cents apiece,\" said Son, who has worked in the industry for over 15 years.  Son said that under the piece-rate system, she has to work 60 hours to 75 hours a week to earn $300. Although a state law is supposed to ensure that employers make up the difference so workers get paid the minimum wage, the U.S. Labor Department found wage violations in 85 percent of the California garment factories it visited.  \"In the garment industry, there\\'s a lot of exploitation and a lot of wage theft,\" Son said.  Son and many of her peers were advocating for California to pass the Garment Worker Protection Act. It would have ensured hourly pay for workers and closed loopholes that have allowed the state\\'s more than 45,000 mostly immigrant garment workers to be paid an average of $5 an hour.  \"The biggest culprits of wage theft in L.A. County are in the garment industry,\" said state Sen. Maria Durazo, a Democrat from Los Angeles, who introduced the bill in April with Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, a Democrat representing a San Diego-area district.  The bill died in the Senate, failing to come up for a vote during the final hours of California\\'s legislative session, which adjourned Aug. 31. The session was suspended for two months because the number of Covid-19 cases surged. California legislators meet every two years.  Most of the U.S. garment production industry is in California, where many clothes and, increasingly, fabric masks are cut and sewn every day by garment workers who can work long shifts in often-crowded factories.  In some instances, workers can make well above the minimum wage through the piece-rate system. But advocates for the Garment Worker Protection Act say the rates in the apparel industry are so low that workers rarely make more than $6 an hour. The measure would have allowed for piece-rate compensation in the form of incentive bonuses.  California has raised the minimum wage to $13 an hour, rising to $14 an hour next year and $15 to hour in 2022. But for garment workers, Son said, \"if the minimum wage is going up, they don\\'t know about it, since everything is paid by the piece.\"  \\'They\\'re risking their lives for us\\'  Durazo said the pandemic makes it even more important to ensure fair wages and decent working conditions for garment workers.  One of Los Angeles County\\'s largest coronavirus outbreaks this past summer was at a garment factory where 375 L.A. Apparel workers tested positive for Covid-19 and four died.  In a statement, L.A. Apparel said it had \"implemented a rigorous safety protocol during the COVID-19 pandemic that exceeded state and county requirements, in addition to providing on-site testing.\"  Like Son, most of Los Angeles\\' garment workers are immigrant women, many of whom are undocumented. Durazo said that leaves them ripe for exploitation. The Garment Worker Protection Act would have designated brands and retailers as \"brand guarantors,\" which would be liable for making sure that the people at the very bottom of their supply chains are paid fairly.  Eliminating piece rate a \\'job killer,\\' say opponents  Critics of the measure argued that the bill would have been a huge blow to the state\\'s garment industry, which has relied on the piece-rate system to compete with cheaper foreign labor in Asia and Latin America.  Multiple business groups spoke out against the bill, including the California Retailers Association and the California Fashion Association, which represents brands like L.A. Apparel and Alibaba, as well as law firms that represent brands like Fashion Nova and Forever 21.  The California Chamber of Commerce called the bill a \"job killer.\"  In a statement to NBC News, CalChamber Executive Vice President Jennifer Barrera said the bill \"proposed to make significant and unprecedented labor and employment policy changes that would have driven the limited manufacturers and businesses in the apparel industry out of California.\"  Barrera added that \"current law already mandates that all employees receive minimum wage, overtime payment, meal and rest periods, and compliance with health and safety regulations.\"  Not all in the industry opposed the bill. A handful of companies already pay their workers fair wages, and they supported the bill because they would like to even the playing field. The eco-conscious brand Reformation supported the legislation.  Worker advocates say that apart from ensuring adequate wages, there needs to be a continued focus on working conditions. A 2015 UCLA Labor Center survey of more than 300 garment workers detailed complaints about unsanitary bathroom conditions, blocked doors and exits and excessive dust, heat and poor ventilation.  Planning to \\'come back stronger\\'  Marissa Nuncio, director of the Garment Worker Center, said she and her colleagues held a Zoom watch party with garment workers to watch the close of legislative session.  \"As they saw it happening, [the garment workers] said: \\'They don\\'t care about us. We\\'re not a priority,\\'\" Nuncio said. \"The workers were right. There were bills that were prioritized and bills that were not. Ours was not.\"  Durazo said: \"2020 has not been the best year. As we regroup to plan for the upcoming legislative session, our garment worker bill will continue to be a priority — while workers continue to be paid by the piece, they continue earning on average $5 an hour. We will grow our coalition and come back even stronger.\"  Son said that she was sad but that she and her peers refuse to feel defeated. \"We will continue fighting because we want this situation to improve,\" she said. \"These companies will not change on their own.\"  Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.', 'The father of a pupil who put out a video fatwa on Samuel Paty for showing Mohammed cartoons in class and two teenagers who were paid to identify the teacher are amongst seven to appear before an anti-terror judge in France.  Eighteen-year-old Chechen refugee Abdullah Anzorov beheaded teacher Samuel Paty outside of a school in a suburb of Paris on Friday, after the history teacher had shown satirical cartoons of the Muslim prophet, Mohammed, to his class during a lesson on freedom of expression.  A number of people had been taken into custody for questioning, with French media announcing on Wednesday that seven must face an anti-terror judge for possible indictments and to establish whether Anzorov, who was shot dead by police, had benefitted from the collaboration of others before committing the deadly Islamist terror attack.  Brahim Chninam is one of the seven. The father of a 13-year-old daughter in Paty’s class, Chninam had posted a video on social media calling for a “mobilisation” against Mr Paty, revealing the teacher’s name and school’s address in Conflans-Saint-Honorine. France’s Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin had described the social media campaign as a “fatwa”. Chninam was also reportedly in contact with Anzorov before the deadly attack, but French media said that the content of the WhatsApp messages had not yet been revealed.  Two others facing indictment include a 14-year-old and a 15-year-old, according to franceinfo, who are suspected of having accepted from Anzorov between €300 and €350 to identify their 47-year-old teacher.  France Shuts Paris Mosque that Shared Fatwa Call Against Beheaded Teacher https://t.co/zcRnwoyHQc — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 20, 2020  There has been growing concern over the radicalisation of pupils in France’s schools. One teacher at a school in the heavily migrant-populated Seine-Saint-Denis said recently that after showing footage of people in Pakistan burning French flags in response to Charlie Hebdo republishing the satirical drawings of Mohammed, his pupils cheered.  Islamist activist Abdelhakim Sefrioui, who supported Chninam in his media campaign against the teacher, will also appear before the judge, according to Le Point. Sefrioui is known to French security services, being on the ‘File S’ of suspects believed to be a threat to national security.  Sefrioui also knows M’hammed Henniche, who leads a group of mosques in Pantin, Seine-Saint-Denis, which shared Chninam’s video on their official Facebook page. However, Henniche said that he had not been in contact with the Islamist activist since 2012.  Henniche was forced to apologise for sharing the post. The Grand Mosque of Pantin, some 45 minutes away from the school, will be closed for six months from Wednesday evening, on the order of the interior minister “in response to its leader sharing a message calling for the intimidation of a teacher and giving out the school’s address”.  Three other adults, described by French media as either friends or relatives of Anzorov, who surrendered themselves to authorities, will also face the judge. LCI revealed that six others, including members of Anzorov’s family, have been released after investigators determined they were not involved in the teacher’s assassination.', 'The election of Joe Biden to the Presidency carries significant economic implications affecting all Americans, ranging from tax policy to educational initiatives, and more.  In particular, some of the Biden team’s proposed policies may have profound impacts on some segments of the Latino community. We spoke with Rich Prinsinzano, Penn Wharton budget model director of policy analysis to discuss some of his findings as described in the PWBM Analysis of the Biden Platform.  Over the long-term, the model projects Biden’s policies would decrease federal debt by 6.1% and increase GDP by 0.8%. The nuances of the plan also carry more specific significance for some segments of the population, such as some parts of the Hispanic community.  Tax Policy  While Biden’s tax plan calls for an increase in taxes for high-income earners (broadly defined as those earning above $400,000 per year), Prinsinzano said that the vast majority of Americans would be unaffected and experience no tax increase.  “There’s basically no increase in marginal tax rates for anybody,” he explained. “Employment taxes may increase for individuals over $400,000, and the income tax rate would be higher for households earning over that amount annually, but that constitutes only the top 1% of income earners. The reality is that the increase in taxes affects very few households, so Hispanics will mostly be part of that majority that will be unaffected.”  Still, Hispanics earning above the $400K threshold may experience some tax increases. And some of Biden’s other tax policy proposals – such as taxation of capital gains at traditional income rates, as well as increasing taxes on corporate foreign-earned income – could impact certain Hispanic investors or business owners.  Education  The Biden plan carries significant proposals for education, including making community college free, and forgiving some portion of student loan debt. For most middle-income Americans including many Hispanics, that can create significant new economic opportunities, said Prinsinzano. “Our analysis shows that a more educated population creates opportunities; it frees up people to advance in more ways. A more educated population is a more productive population. The economy grows as educational levels grow.”  The Biden plan also proposes free public college for low-income Americans, making education more accessible for millions of families who fall in this income category. And forgiveness of some amount of student loan debt helps millions of debt-saddled borrowers use their earnings more productively so they can buy homes, start a businesses and invest.  Immigration  Perhaps one of the biggest policy differences between a Trump and Biden administration is management of immigration. In fact, the Penn Wharton Budget Model suggests that Biden is likely to model his immigration policy on the 2013 Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, which, according to the PWBM study, includes: \"A 10-year transition to lawful permanent resident status for undocumented immigrants, including immediate work permits to transition them to full legal status. Drawing on a CBO analysis of the 2013 bill, S. 744, we estimate that two-thirds of unauthorized immigrants would gain legal status under Biden’s plan.\"  Prinsinzano goes further in describing the economic boost likely to be generated by this policy proposal. “There are proposals from the Biden campaign for a path to citizenship bill similar to what was proposed under the Obama aministration, and we ran that through our models. We found it’s good for the economy. Immigrants -- especially Hispanic immigrants -- tend to have more children, which grows the economy.” As he explainedpopulation growth tends to increase economic growth through channels such as increased consumption and tax contributions.  The impact of Biden’s immigration policies is also likely to be felt by highly-skilled immigrants such as those seeking H1-B visas. This type of visa allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations including those in STEM fields.  “The H1-B visa limitations would likely be undone by Biden, and that would be a positive boost for the economy, since Trump’s proposal to shut that off would limit the number of highly skilled professionals entering the country,” said Prinsinzano.  Finally, Prinsinzano noted that a Biden Administration may affect trade with Latin American countries. Trump’s re-negotiation of NAFTA and other regional trade agreements impacted some Latin American nations, and Biden may seek to further re-negotiate these.  “Trump re-negotiated NAFTA, and other agreements, which could impact trade in the region. Some of the changes Trump made affect Central American countries,” Prinsinzano pointed out. “Biden, similar to Trump, could change some trade deals.”  Whether the changes proposed by Biden are a net negative or positive for your household is dependent on several personal factors and preferences. Nonetheless, one thing is for certain: the tenor of the overall impact on Americans – including Hispanics – is likely to represent a seismic shift from the current policy environment.

That program grants temporary employment directly related to the student’s field, and allows them to work for up to 12 months before and after their studies are finished.  But it has raised concerns about abuse, and ICE says it arrested 15 non-immigrant students who claimed to be employed by companies that don’t exist. “Non-immigrant” refers to immigrants who are on temporary visas, rather than those living permanently in the U.S.  ICE said the arrests took place in Massachusetts, Texas, Florida, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania and included 11 Indian nationals, two Libyan nationals, one Senegalese national and one Bangladeshi national.  BIDEN WOULD RETURN TO OBAMA-ERA IMMIGRATION POLICIES IF ELECTED, REPORT SAYS  Acting Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is also sending out about 700 letters to a group of 1100 foreign nationals that ICE identified as in the U.S. \"out of status.\"  ICE will seek to remove them from the country, and they’ve been informed their work permits will be revoked. The remaining few hundred have work permits that expire so soon that USCIS isn’t even issuing a letter, they simply won’t renew their work permits.  He also suggested that employers, as well as immigrants, had abused the program for cheap labor.  \"One of the most un-American things I can think of is an employer who is depriving qualified Americans of work while filling that job with a foreign national who doesn’t qualify for it, just to save a buck,” he said.  Cuccinelli said it was one of a number of actions taken by Trump to make sure that the labor market \"is clear for American workers to get back to work first” after the spike in unemployment related to the COVID-19 crisis.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  The move was welcomed by those in favor of immigration restrictions, although the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) said the administration should go a step further and scrap the program.  \"While this enforcement under new ICE Director Pham is encouraging, it’s long past time for the White House to end the OPT program entirely,\" RJ Hauman, FAIR\\'s head of government relations told Fox News. \"It’s not Congressionally mandated, diverts over a billion dollars from Medicare and Social Security due to payroll tax exemption, and worst of all, it takes jobs away from American graduates looking for employment in these trying times.\"', 'WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court tries to stay out of politics, but it begins its 2020 term Monday as both a divisive issue in the presidential election and the potential arbiter of it.  Shorthanded and still mourning the death last month of Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the eight remaining justices will carry on their work amid a partisan firestorm over her likely successor.  At the same time, they will face a flurry of emergency petitions from Democrats and Republicans over the way mail-in ballots are distributed, delivered and counted in an election President Donald Trump claims – without proof – has been rigged against him.  Not since 1991 has the court faced an ideological shift as dramatic as the one federal appeals court Judge Amy Coney Barrettrepresents. Not since 2000 has it faced the prospect of interceding so deeply in a presidential election.  Amy Coney Barrett: Talented judge, popular professor brings solid conservative credentials  And the Senate confirmation fight, which will drown out the more mundane docket of cases the justices will consider by phone because of the COVID-19 pandemic, comes with its own rancorous history. Republicans are determined to confirm Trump\\'s nominee days before the election after blocking President Barack Obama\\'s similar effort in 2016.  More:Trump and 2 senators\\' positive COVID-19 tests spark worries over Amy Coney Barrett confirmation, but GOP moving forward anyway  The ideological, political and procedural firestorms will make it difficult for the court to do what Chief Justice John Roberts strives to do: call balls and strikes, and steer clear of politics.  “The last thing they want is for the court to be seen as even more partisan,\" says David Strauss, who heads the Supreme Court and appellate clinic at the University of Chicago Law School. \"That’s the worst possible outcome.”  The political controversies at the high court\\'s doorstep threaten its standing as the most trusted branch of government. The executive and legislative branches, battling over the pandemic, a foundering economy, racial inequities, immigration and health care, fare much worse.  The high court\\'s year began with Roberts presiding over the president\\'s impeachment trial in the Senate and included landmark rulings denying Trump the immunity he sought to protect his tax returns and financial records from investigation. It could end with the justices playing a crucial role in the presidential and congressional elections.  But when it comes to the federal judiciary, Trump may have the last laugh. Having named two Supreme Court justices and more than 200 lower federal court judges in his first term already, he is on the verge of adding a third justice: a deeply conservative, 48-year-old judge and Notre Dame law professor from Indiana who could reshape the court for decades to come.  More:Six conservative justices? 10 ways the Supreme Court could change  “On the whole, we’re going to see a considerable and perhaps quite rapid shift to the right,\" said Orin Kerr, a University of California-Berkeley School of Law professor, during a recent panel discussion sponsored by the conservative Federalist Society. With Barrett replacing Ginsburg, he said, \"That\\'s a very conservative court.\"  Conservative ascendance  To be sure, the high court has been conservative for decades. But the tilt has been somewhat tenuous, moderated by justices in the middle such as Sandra Day O\\'Connor, Anthony Kennedy and, most recently, Roberts himself.  Ginsburg\\'s death occurred just in time for Republicans to change that. For much of the past year, her battle with cancer privately riveted liberals as well as conservatives, her every medical relapse and recovery hitting the headlines.  Former U.S. solicitor general Paul Clement has argued more than 100 Supreme Court cases, but he always will remember the most recent one, held by telephone while Ginsburg was in the hospital.  \"What an image that somebody was so dedicated to her craft and her role that she literally was asking questions from her hospital bed,\" Clement recalled at a Supreme Court conference sponsored by William & Mary Law School.  Remembering RBG:Justice Ginsburg returns to Supreme Court for final time  Trump wasted no time with procedural formalities. The White House contacted Barrett the day after Ginsburg\\'s death, and two days later the federal judge and mother of seven was interviewed and offered the nomination.  All but two Senate Republicans quickly endorsed moving ahead with confirmation, all but assuring she wil join the court in time for oral arguments in November. If so, one of her first cases will determine whether religious groups can be exempt from anti-discrimination laws, followed closely by a third major threat to the Affordable Care Act.  In that case, Ginsburg\\'s death makes what had appeared to be the health care law\\'s likely survival a bit more precarious. Republicans who have tried for a decade to kill the law could have Barrett on their side. Democrats and their liberal interest group allies, meanwhile, are trying to use the threat to their advantage in the confirmation battle.  More:Health care law faces another Supreme Court showdown, this time without Justice Ginsburg\\'s vote  For her part, Barrett insists she would not impose her personal convictions on the law.  \"The president has nominated me to serve on the United States Supreme Court, and that institution belongs to all of us,\" she said in a Rose Garden ceremony Sept. 26. \"If confirmed, I would not assume that role for the sake of those in my own circle, and certainly not for my own sake.\"  That\\'s of little solace to abortion rights advocates who fear that Barrett, who is on record opposing abortion personally, would help the court uphold new state restrictions. Longer term, they fear the court could overrule its 1973 Roe v. Wade precedent legalizing abortion nationwide.  Fact check:In early 1970s, RBG represented woman discharged from military because she wouldn\\'t get an abortion  “I’ve never been more afraid for the prospects ahead,\" says Louise Melling, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union.  Counting every ballot  Abortion rights survived the recently concluded Supreme Court term intact, along with other liberal causes such as LGBTQ rights and protecting undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children from deportation. In each case, Roberts joined the liberal wing.  This term, a similar coalition is considered likely to save most of the Affordable Care Act, even without Ginsburg. States governed by Republicans want the entire law struck down because Congress in 2017 eliminated the tax used to enforce its mandate that most people purchase insurance. But Roberts and Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote separate opinions last term that allowed statutes to stand after severing problematic provisions.  It\\'s far more likely that the court\\'s 2020 term will be known for the many voting rights cases headed its way. The court has been involved in the election since April when it ruled 5-4 along ideological lines that absentee voting in Wisconsin could not be extended past the primary election date.  More:Supreme Court is shorthanded but could play role in election  More than 300 lawsuits have been filed, in nearly every state, thanks largely to problems associated with COVID-19 and the expansion of voting by mail. Republicans, including Trump\\'s reelection campaign, want to limit mail-in voting while Democrats push for greater opportunities.  Any day now, the justices are expected to decide if Pennsylvania can count mail-in ballots for three days after Election Day. A similar lawsuit in Wisconsin is headed toward the high court. Both states are crucial battlegrounds in Trump\\'s battle against former Democratic vice president Joe Biden.  Before, during and after Election Day, \"It\\'s easy to imagine the campaigns fighting over every absentee ballot,\" says Richard Pildes, a leading election law expert at New York University School of Law.  Trump has raised that prospect as a reason for the Senate to confirm Barrett by Election Day. After privately offering her the nomination but before announcing it, Trump said, \"I think this will end up in the Supreme Court, and I think it\\'s very important we have nine justices.\"  That has led some liberal interest groups to argue that if she is confirmed, Barrett should recuse herself from considering election-related cases. Judges and justices generally remove themselves from a case only for more personal reasons, such as family interests or financial investments.  “Trump has put Barrett in a very difficult position,\" says Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California-Irvine School of Law. \"Now her objectivity in any Trump v. Biden case could reasonably be called into question.”  Packing the court  Once the election and subsequent lawsuits are history, the justices will hope to sink back into relative obscurity. But that\\'s unlikely to happen.  Whether Trump and Senate Republicans succeed in creating a 6-3 majority on the court or not, Democrats and allied groups appear intent on considering retaliatory changes to the court\\'s structure.  More:Liberal groups seek to make Supreme Court an issue in 2020 presidential race, and conservatives exult  If they emerge from the election with Biden in the White House and majorities in both houses of Congress, Democrats could try something last attempted by President Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s: adding seats to the nation\\'s highest bench. That would allow them to install liberal justices as a counterweight to the court\\'s conservative majority.  Ginsburg\\'s death \"makes court-packing by the Democrats more likely than it\\'s ever been,\" Strauss says. And that could lead Republicans, if they later regain power, to fight court-packing with more packing.  Under that scenario, \"the Supreme Court starts to look ridiculous,\" Clement said at the William & Mary conference. \"They\\'ve got to get a new bench.”', 'In 2016, a total of 206 counties across the country that voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 swung away to support Republican nominee Donald Trump in 2016. Wisconsin has 23 of these counties.  More than a dozen of these counties are in western Wisconsin. Communities lining the banks of the Mississippi River helped turn Wisconsin Republican in the first presidential election since 1984.  These rural, overwhelmingly White and sparsely populated counties in the state\\'s western edge are highly sought, in large part, for their lack of partisan loyalty at a time when Americans sit increasingly entrenched in Democratic and Republican camps.  Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox  John Valentine, a 55-year-old from Viola, Wisconsin who works in maintenance, supported Mr. Obama in 2008, but regretted his decision because his health insurance costs then went up. He sat out 2012, but voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 and is voting for him again this year.  \"He\\'s a leader — he\\'s not afraid to tell people what needs to be said,\" Valentine said while packing up his car outside of a Walmart in Richland County. Mr. Obama won the county by 16.1 points in 2012, and Mr. Trump won it by 5.5 points in 2016.  And while many of Wisconsin\\'s small towns and cities in its southwestern corner drove up Mr. Trump\\'s margins, most had not voted for Republicans in decades, says Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  \"That was part of Trump\\'s victory in the state, for sure — to cobble together a lot of those small communities to overcome losses in other parts of the state,\" said Burden. The communities also tend to skew older and with working-class roots, a critical base of support for Mr. Trump\\'s 2016 victory offsetting smaller margins in the traditionally Republican suburbs.  \"Compared to prior Republicans, both statewide candidates and presidential candidates, Trump is not faring as well in the suburbs as they had, particularly the suburbs around Milwaukee,\" said Burden. \"He needs to compensate by winning some Republican votes elsewhere, and four years ago, that was done by winning a lot of rural communities.\"  But Democrats reclaimed some of the territory in western Wisconsin in 2018. Governor Tony Evers carried five of the counties that Mr. Trump flipped, and Senator Tammy Baldwin won nine.  Burden said that the president\\'s message on trade, health care and illegal immigration resonated with voters four years ago, but some are \"unsatisfied\" with Mr. Trump\\'s record.  Many communities in the region have deep ties to farming, especially in southwestern Wisconsin and have endured big losses in recent years. In 2019, Wisconsin led the country in farm bankruptcies, according to the American Farm Bureau, and the state lost 10% of its dairy herds due to low milk prices.  Representative Ron Kind, a moderate Democrat whose district encompasses many of the areas that pivoted to Mr. Trump in 2016, thinks both parties \"have been derelict in addressing income inequality, and opportunities for all workers.\"  The 12-term incumbent now faces a serious challenge to keep his seat. President Trump won Kind\\'s district by 4 points in 2016, when he was unopposed.. This year, Kind is depending on Democrats\\' \"PTSD from 2016,\" combined with greater enthusiasm for Joe Biden, to drive turnout.  \"Obviously, four years ago, you had a known entity of 30 years. People had pretty much made their mind up, and decided to take a flyer on the outside change agent, Donald Trump,\" Kind told CBS News. \"Fast-forward four years, and I don\\'t think there\\'s a lot of embrace of what they\\'ve seen and what he has done, especially at the height of this pandemic.\"  As coronavirus\\' third resurgence ravages the Midwest, nearly every county in western and southwest Wisconsin is seeing \"very high\" case activity levels according to state data, with hospitalizations on the rise in some counties.  Bob Nugent, a 76-year-old retired school administrator from Ithaca, Wisconsin, recently recovered from COVID-19. The Biden supporter experienced a bad cough and felt constantly fatigued.  \"It\\'s unimaginable that a country of our wealth and...how medically astute we are that we\\'re in this position,\" Nugent said \"And it\\'s just because Donald Trump screwed up.\"  On Tuesday, just before President Trump arrived to campaign in West Salem, health officials in the state announced Wisconsin\\'s highest number of daily coronavirus cases and deaths since the pandemic began. That same day, the U.S. added more than 74,000 cases.  The president repeatedly told rally-goers that the country was \"rounding the turn\" on the pandemic, a metaphor ready-made for La Crosse Fairgrounds Speedway. \"This race track, look at this. It\\'s perfect. We\\'re rounding the curve. We will vanquish the virus.\"  Both Biden and Mr. Trump are in Wisconsin on Friday. It\\'s Biden\\'s third trip since he secured the Democratic nomination and Mr.Trump\\'s ninth campaign visit to the state since January 2019 and his fourth stop in October.  The final Marquette University Law School poll before the election showed Biden leading Mr. Trump 48% to 43% among likely voters, a margin that has held relatively steady since the spring. The latest CBS News Battleground Tracker also shows Biden leading in Wisconsin by 6 points.  Kind\\'s challenger, Derrick Van Orden, argues that the fact that Mr. Trump is not a career politician, coupled with the signing of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will bolster his popularity in this part of the state, particularly among farmers and manufacturers.  \"There\\'s a tremendous amount of independents and former Democrats that have come up to me and said, \\'we are supporting you because we know that you are going to put us first,\\'\" Van Orden said. \"And that\\'s exactly the same reason that these former Democrats, or gee, some of them are current Democrats and independents are voting for President Trump this year.\"  The president\\'s reelection bid claims that more than half of those who registered online for his rally in West Salem are not listed as Republicans in their voter database, while just over a quarter did not vote in 2016.  Voters like Ellen Sanson, a retired clinical laboratory scientist who lives in Lancaster, finds neither candidate appealing. She\\'s voting for Mr. Trump: \"I\\'m going to go with the devil I know instead of the devil I don\\'t.\"  But she remarked, \"I don\\'t think he\\'s been bad for the country, but his mouth gets him in trouble.\"  Sanson voted for Mr. Trump four years ago and said she likes what he did for the economy before the pandemic and his focus on the military. Biden is too old, she\\'s decided, and she worries about running mate Kamala Harris\\' experience. There was one Democrat she would have voted for in November: Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar.  In Juneau County, where Mr. Obama won by 7 points in 2012 and Mr. Trump by 26, artist Diane Dahl says she\\'s tired of the political division. She rents space to the local Democratic Party in a building she owns, and has lost at least one prospective tenant because of it.  \"One person has stopped to look at it and pretty much on the way out said, \\'Well, if the Democrats would ever leave, let me know,\\'\" said Dahl, who voted for Biden. \"We have to stop the hate. We just have to stop this hate that is festering through the country.\"', 'A wooden boat carrying migrants bound for Europe capsized off the coast of Libya and 20 of them drowned, an international humanitarian group said. The statement from Doctors Without Borders late Thursday came just hours after it was revealed that another shipwreck had claimed the lives of at least 74 migrants in the Mediterranean Sea.  Only three women could be rescued by local fishermen, the group said on Twitter. \"They were in shock and terrified; they saw loved ones disappear beneath the waves, dying in front of their eyes,\" the statement said.  The wooden boat was carrying 23 migrants who had departed from the Libyan coastal town of Sorman, said Anais Deprade, a spokesperson for MSF, the abbreviation for the French name of the group, Medecins Sans Frontieres.  Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox  One of the three survivors lost her husband, her sister and her sister\\'s 1-year-old child, Deprade said.  Alarm Phone, an independent group that supports rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea, tweeted that the boat had called them for rescue before it sank. The group said it \"repeatedly\" requested a search-and-rescue operation by EU authorities. \"In vain. They decided to let them drown. Our hearts are broken,\" the group tweeted.  Earlier on Thursday, the U.N. migration agency said at least 74 migrants had drowned when their boat capsized off the coast of the Libyan port of al-Khums. Only 47 people were rescued by the Libyan coast guard and fishermen and brought to shore. As of late Thursday, 31 bodies were retrieved as the search for the remaining victims continued, the International Organization for Migration said.  A migrant kisses a baby after they both were rescued by NGO Proactiva Open Arms in the Mediterranean sea, Nov. 11, 2020. The Open Arms rescue ship had been searching for the boat in distress for hours before finally finding it Wednesday morning in international waters north of Libya. Sergi Camara / AP  In the years since the 2011 uprising that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, war-torn Libya has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants hoping to get to Europe from Africa and the Middle East. Smugglers often pack desperate families into ill-equipped rubber boats that stall and founder along the perilous Central Mediterranean route. At least 20,000 people have died in those waters since 2014, according to the IOM.  In recent years, the EU has partnered with Libya\\'s coast guard and other local groups to stem the dangerous sea crossings. Rights groups, however, say those policies leave migrants at the mercy of armed groups or confined in squalid detention centers rife with abuses.  Last month, at least 140 migrants trying to reach Europe drowned off the coast of Senegal when their boat caught fire and capsized.  According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), there have been at least 825 migrant deaths reported in the Mediterranean region in 2020. The group says there have been more than 2,500 migrant fatalities worldwide this year.', 'The coronavirus crash has completely impoverished New York City’s huge illegal-migrant population, so it needs a bailout from billionaires, says a far left group of open border activists.  The advocacy group, Make the Road NY, wants to raise $5.5 billion from 120 New York billionaires to provide roughly $750 per week in aid for up to 1.2 million illegal migrants and their dependents. Numerous Democratic legislators back the campaign.  The New York Times gave the draft legislation a boost on November 15, with an excellent video report that showcased some of the unemployed, illegal migrants who were trying to earn some cash as street vendors:  On one corner, Cristina Sanchez stood forlornly at a produce stand. She had not sold a single thing. During the pandemic she had lost her job, and then her rented room, triggering a frantic hustle to survive: First she sold produce, then tacos, then produce again … … “This has affected my children [in Mexico] a lot,” Cristina said, as she started to cry. “I try to tell them that because there’s no steady work, whatever I make is only enough for me to survive for the day.”  The New York Times showcased one of the group’s members, “Gerardo,” a Mexican who arrived in 2006:  He decided to sell tacos de alambre — made with steak, chiles, bacon and cheese — on the street.

The Make the Road group said its surveys showed that:  92% of respondents reported that either they or another earner in their household has lost their job or income as a result of the crisis. 84% of respondents are now themselves unemployed, with 88% of them reporting job loss due to COVID-19. Only 5% of respondents received unemployment benefits in the last month. 90% of household cleaners had lost their jobs. Those that were working had fewer clients than usual and had lost income.  The group’s survey says that 28 percent of renters in New York pay more than 50 percent of their wages on housing in the city’s migrant-crowded neighborhoods.  The scale of the imported poverty is huge but unclear.  Make the Road claims 1.2 million people “who haven’t received any aid,” while the New York Times says the city includes roughly half a million illegals.  The leaders in New York City choose to build their service and real-estate economies on cheap imported labor, so denying wages, jobs, and home to the many Americans who did live – or want to live — in the city.  Now the coronavirus crash is threatening the city’s economy by pushing out impoverished migrants, and their departure is pressuring employers to raise wages high enough to attract Americans to jobs in New York.  New York’s problem with impoverished illegal migrants is mirrored in Boston, Massachusetts, and in Los Angeles.', \"How a nonprofit is preparing to derail a Green New Deal Presented by Robinhood  With Daniel Lippman  HOW A NONPROFIT IS PREPARING TO DERAIL A GREEN NEW DEAL: A nonprofit dedicated to combating the Green New Deal and championing natural gas has been working to win over lawmakers and build grassroots support this summer as it prepares for the threat of a Joe Biden administration — or the opportunity of President Donald Trump’s second term. The nonprofit, called the Empowerment Alliance, was set up last year and is funded by anonymous donors. Terry Holt, a Republican operative whose firm, HDMK, is consulting for the alliance, told PI last year that the group was up against a “flood of left-wing money that would have us virtually shut down” the natural gas industry.  — The Empowerment Alliance has recruited more than 100,000 people to its grassroots network by running digital ads asking voters whether they “stand with President Trump’s American Energy Plan” and warning that Russia and Saudi Arabia are “Trying to Kill American Energy Independence,” according to the group. It’s also persuaded House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and dozens of other Republican lawmakers, governors and state attorneys general to sign a “Declaration of Energy Independence” championing “domestic natural gas discovered, produced, and refined in the U.S.”  — “Though it won’t make the headlines, increasing natural gas production has resulted in lower energy costs for American families while reducing air pollution,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) wrote in an op-ed in July in which he noted he’d signed the nonprofit’s declaration. “And last year, the U.S. led the world in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, while providing affordable energy to everyone.”  Good afternoon, and welcome to PI.

The trade group is pushing Congress to set up “grant programs or programs with some form of loan forgiveness,” such as a second round of Paycheck Protection Program loans and an expansion of the program “that waives the affiliation rule or counts employees by full time equivalents rather than headcount on payroll.”  EMHOFF HEADLINES ‘LAWYERS FOR BIDEN’ EVENT: Sen. Kamala Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, and her brother-in-law, Tony West, headlined a ‘Lawyers for Biden’ fundraiser on Wednesday that drew more than 700 people, according to a pool report. The event had brought in $960,000 by the time it started. Emhoff is on leave from DLA Piper, where he’s a partner, and West is Uber’s chief legal officer. Jonathan Henes, a partner in Kirkland & Ellis’ New York office, introduced them.  DEJOY TAPS REPUBLICAN LOBBYIST TO AID OUTREACH TO CONGRESS: Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told postal officials on Wednesday “that he had selected Peter Pastre, a former Republican congressional aide and insurance lobbyist, to act as a liaison for the agency with Congress and state and local governments, according to people familiar with the discussions,” The New York Times’ Ken Vogel, Hailey Fuchs and Luke Broadwater report. “The move came as the Postal Service was facing mounting political and operational crises. Mr. Trump has raised concerns about the security of voting by mail, and the independent quasi-governmental agency has struggled to overcome a delivery slowdown and a dire financial forecast — all while Democrats accuse Mr. DeJoy and the agency’s Republican-majority governing board of doing the president’s bidding.”  — “Mr. Pastre, who worked in the 1980s as an aide to the Republican former Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming and made his reputation in Washington as a politically active government relations executive for the insurance industry, was chosen in part because he was seen by Postal Service management as someone who could reach out to Democrats, according to people familiar with the selection process. Mr. Pastre worked for 16 years at MetLife, where he directed the company’s federal political action committee, which has donated more to Republicans in recent years.”  SELF-PROMOTION ISN’T CHEAP: “When Seema Verma, the Trump administration's top Medicaid official, went to a reporter's home in November 2018 for a ‘Girl's Night’ thrown in her honor, taxpayers footed the bill to organize the event: $2,933,” POLITICO’s Dan Diamond and Adam Cancryn report. “When Verma wrote an op-ed on Fox News' website that fall, touting President Donald Trump's changes to Obamacare, taxpayers got charged for one consultant's price to place it: $977. And when consultants spent months promoting Verma to win awards like Washingtonian magazine's ‘Most Powerful Women in Washington’ and appear on high-profile panels, taxpayers got billed for that too: more than $13,000.”  — “The efforts were steered by Pam Stevens, a Republican communications consultant and former Trump administration official working to raise the brand of Verma, who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The prices were the amount a consulting company billed the government for her services, based on her invoices, which were obtained by congressional Democrats.”  — “They are among the revelations included in a sweeping congressional investigation chronicling how Verma spent more than $3.5 million on a range of GOP-connected consultants, who polished her public profile, wrote her speeches and Twitter posts, brokered meetings with high-profile individuals — and even billed taxpayers for connecting Verma with fellow Republicans in Congress.”  IF YOU MISSED IT ON WEDNESDAY: “TikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance Ltd., is discussing with the U.S. government possible arrangements that would allow the popular video-sharing app to avoid a full sale of its U.S. operations, according to people familiar with the matter,” The Wall Street Journal’s Miriam Gottfried, Georgia Wells and Kate Davidson report. “Discussions around such an option have risen in prominence since the Chinese government took steps that make a sale to a U.S. technology giant like Microsoft Corp. more difficult, the people said. They take place against a fast-approaching deadline that President Trump imposed for TikTok to agree to a sale of its U.S. operations or else be shut down, and as geopolitical wrangling over the app intensifies.”  Jobs Report  — The Canadian quantum-computing company D-Wave Systems has hired Allison Schwartz as its global government relations and public affairs leader.

This time around, some have claimed that Sen. Kamala Harris is ineligible for the presidency because, though born in the United States, her parents were immigrants who had not become citizens by the time of her birth.  We believe this claim is untenable. But the need to address the matter at all highlights why eligibility distinctions that turn on place of birth or status of parent ought to be abolished. That eligibility for our highest political office is conditioned by an invidious discrimination buried in the Constitution itself should be highly disturbing.  In 2016, the targets were Republican candidates Ted Cruz (born in Canada to U.S.-citizen parents who had immigrated from Cuba) and Marco Rubio (also the son of Cuban immigrants). In 2008 and 2012, Barack Obama, was assailed by “birthers” who falsely claimed he was born outside the United States. Obama\\'s 2008 GOP opponent, John McCain, came under attack because he was born in what was then the Panama Canal Zone. Such episodes are all too likely to recur. In an increasingly diverse society, it will often be possible to claim tendentiously that some candidate or other is ineligible.  Ban does not apply to other offices  Sen. Tammy Duckworth’s stock as a potential running mate for Joe Biden reportedly declined in part because of concerns that there might be litigation over her eligibility since she was born in Thailand to an American-citizen father and a Thai mother. The incident illustrates how even a highly dubious accusation of ineligibility can derail a potentially promising nominee  Barring naturalized citizens from eligibility for the presidency is little different from discrimination based on race, ethnicity or gender. Such unchosen circumstances of birth say nothing about a person\\'s competence or moral fitness for office. Our legal system rejects the natural born requirement elsewhere. It does not apply to governors, members of Congress, justices of the Supreme Court, cabinet officers, or the Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It should be removed as a condition for eligibility for the presidency.  Although the history of the natural born citizenship requirement is murky, its adoption probably stemmed from fear of skulduggery by European royalty who might seek election to the presidency. This concern, overblown in the 1780s, is even less plausible today.  The most obvious objection to letting immigrants ascend to the presidency is concern that they might be less loyal to the nation than native-born citizens. But there is no good reason to think that people who became Americans by choice are less likely to be loyal than those who did so merely by accident of birth.  Our American stories: Like Kamala Harris, I\\'m the daughter of an Indian immigrant.  If the issue is that immigrant-citizens might have a conflict of interest by virtue of economic or social connections abroad, the same issue can arise with natural-born citizens, as witness the numerous conflicts arising from Donald Trump’s business dealings. The appropriate solution is to impose uniform conflict-of-interest rules that apply equally to all regardless of origins.  Time to end quadrennial claptrap  Some may fear that immigrants have less knowledge of American society than their native-born peers. But that concern is addressed satisfactorily by the Article II requirement that to be president a person must be 35 years of age and a resident within the United States for 14 years.  The constitutional amendment needed to repeal the natural born citizen requirement will be difficult to enact. Any amendment is an uphill struggle because of the required hurdle of securing two-thirds majorities in both houses of Congress, and ratification by three-fourths of state legislatures. This amendment would also face headwinds because of strong anti-immigrant sentiment on the political right. But things might well change as the current political moment passes, xenophobia recedes (polls show younger voters are much more supportive of immigration than older ones), and more people come to realize how ridiculous this restriction is. At the very least, Americans may get tired of hearing this claptrap every four years.  Citizens who can be kicked out:Donald Trump\\'s denaturalization task force is a new way to threaten the American Dream  Favoring the amendment is the fact that supporters hail from across the political spectrum. The two of us come from very different backgrounds and have widely divergent ideological views. But we agree that the time has come to put an end to this wrongful exclusion.  We are not alone. Robert Post, former dean of the Yale Law School and a strong liberal, denounced the requirement stirringly: “[A]t the very heart of the constitutional order, in the Office of the President, the Constitution abandons its brave experiment of forging a new society based upon principles of voluntary commitment; it instead gropes for security among ties of blood and contingencies of birth.” So, too, did former Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a strong conservative. Proposing a 2003 amendment to abolish the clause, he described it as an “unfounded inequity” and “an anachronism that is decidedly un-American.” He was right.  Randall Kennedy is the Michael R.

The women, including 13 Australians, were examined at Hamad International Airport on Oct. 2 after Qatar Airways Flight 908 to Sydney was delayed.  Australia\\'s foreign affairs department described the treatment of the women as inappropriate and beyond circumstances in which they could give free and informed consent.  Australian Foreign Minister Marine Payne speaks at Parliament House in Canberra, Oct. 26, 2020. LUKAS COCH / AP  \"This is a grossly, grossly disturbing, offensive, concerning set of events,\" Foreign Minister Marise Payne told reporters. \"It\\'s not something that I\\'ve ever heard of occurring in my life, in any context. We have made our views very clear to the Qatari authorities on this matter.\"  Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox  Australia will await a report from the Qatari government before \"we will determine the next steps,\" Payne said.  She said the matter was reported to Australian Federal Police, but did not explain what action police might take. Police said in a statement they are working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the matter and that further comment would be inappropriate.  The baby was still unidentified and was being cared for by medical and social workers, airport officials said in a statement sent to The Associated Press.  Medical professionals were concerned for the mother\\'s health and had requested she be located, it said. \"Individuals who had access to a specific area of the airport where the newborn infant was found were asked to assist in the query,\" it added.  The statement did not acknowledge the forced examinations.  The women were examined in an ambulance parked on the tarmac, Seven Network News reported.  Wolfgang Babeck, who was returning home to Australia on the flight, said women were taken from the plane regardless of their age.  \"When the women came back, many of them or probably all of them were upset. One of them was in tears, a younger woman, and people couldn\\'t believe what had happened,\" Babeck said.  \"They told me they had to take their underwear off or their clothes from the bottom and then it was inspected whether they had given birth,\" he added.  Babeck said no explanation was provided for why the departure was delayed for more than three hours or why women were required to leave the plane. He said the examinations were conducted by a woman.  The passengers are now in 14-day hotel quarantines in Sydney as part of coronavirus measures.  Qatar Airways and the Qatari government did not respond to questions from the AP on Monday.  In Qatar, like much of the Middle East, sex outside of marriage is a criminal act. Female migrant workers in the past have hidden their pregnancies and tried to travel abroad to give birth. Others have abandoned their babies anonymously to avoid prison.  Qatar, a small, energy-rich country on the Arabian Peninsula, is home to state-owned Qatar Airways, which along with Etihad and Emirates leverages its location to be a major hub for East-West travel. Its modern Hamad International Airport serves as the base for Qatar Airways\\' operations and soon will funnel travelers into the country for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.', 'Senate sidetracked by Covid-19 cases  Editor’s Note: Weekly Shift is a weekly version of POLITICO Pro’s daily Employment & Immigration policy newsletter, Morning Shift.

Quick Fix  SENATE OUT UNTIL OCT. 19: The full Senate will return two weeks later than scheduled after Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) tested positive for the coronavirus, our Congress team reports. The announcement came as President Donald Trump, who tested positive for Covid-19 last Friday, was spending the weekend at Walter Reed Medical Center just north of Washington.  But Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the change of plans won’t stop the Senate from moving forward with Amy Coney Barrett\\'s Supreme Court nomination. The Senate Judiciary Committee is still set to begin confirmation hearings on Oct. 12.  The delay will interrupt the Senate’s other business. Last week, the Senate Homeland Security Committee advanced Chad Wolf’s nomination to lead the Department of Homeland Security permanently, meaning he now awaits a full Senate vote. And since McConnell had filed cloture on a handful of judicial nominees before the Senate pushed back its schedule, it’s even more unclear when Wolf will be up next.  And the outbreak “has added another layer of chaos to already tumultuous negotiations over renewing aid for airline workers,” our Stephanie Beasley reports, throwing into doubt whether any relief could be passed soon. On Friday, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi promised that airline aid will be enacted one way or another, whether as part of a larger package or as a standalone bill.  House members are on call to head back to D.C. as soon as a deal is reached, but even if an aid bill passes the House, the Senate\\'s planned recess raises questions about its fate. A spokesperson for McConnell declined to comment on whether Senate members would consider voting on airline aid prior to Oct. 19.  Complicating matters, three more Republican senators have said they are quarantining, narrowing the GOP’s 53-member majority. And don’t forget, Senate rules stipulate that Senators need to be in Washington in order to cast their votes.  GOOD MORNING.

Driving the Day  CDC OFFICIALS FOUGHT TRUMP BORDER POLICY: Senior officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention objected to a March order the CDC issued that permitted border agents “to immediately return to Mexico any migrants they encountered crossing the border, citing the threat of the coronavirus,” Michelle Hackman, Andrew Restuccia and Stephanie Armour report for The Wall Street Journal.  “White House officials said at the time the order was driven by the advice of public-health experts and was solely a pandemic-related safety precaution intended to prevent Covid-19 from spreading through cramped and unsanitary Border Patrol stations, where migrants arrested at the border would be crowded together.”  But Hackman, Restuccia and Armour found “the policy was driven by immigration officials in the administration over the objections of senior officials at the CDC, the agency with the authority to issue the order, who warned the rationale behind enacting the pandemic policy was an inappropriate use of its public-health powers.”  “The policy achieves a longstanding goal that Trump administration officials have publicly discussed to discourage or prevent migrants at the southern border from making claims for asylum, which they believe are often meritless,” they write.  Business Relief  REGAL MAY SHUTTER ALL LOCATIONS: “The second-largest cinema chain in America is likely to close indefinitely all its U.S. locations, after reopening in August,” R.T.

MORE ON THAT AIRLINE AID: Pelosi on Friday asked airline executives directly to hold off on massive job cuts, promising that Congress would deliver “imminent” relief, our Sarah Ferris, Tanya Snyder and Sam Mintz report.  BACKGROUND: “The U.S. airline industry is at a crisis point, with thousands of furloughs and layoffs going into effect Thursday after Congress failed to renew a pandemic aid program for aviation workers.” Airlines had agreed to reverse those job cuts if Pelosi and Secretary Steven Mnuchin could reach a deal in the next few days, but as of Sunday they remain far apart on key issues.  “The airline aid, which would cost roughly $28 billion, has broad bipartisan support, but has been unable to win approval from Congress amid more contentious disputes over coronavirus relief,” Sarah, Sam and Tanya write.  ALSO: “Mnuchin: Administration will simplify small business loan forgiveness,” from our Zachary Warmbrodt  Unions  FLRA LIMITS FEDERAL BARGAINING RIGHTS: The Federal Labor Relations Authority issued a trio of decisions last week that make it harder for federal employee unions to negotiate on issues not brought up during formal contract negotiations, Erich Wagner reports for Government Executive.  The first decision raised the standard for whether an agency policy change “triggers a duty to bargain” over its implementation. The second found that federal labor law “neither requires nor prohibits midterm bargaining” and “makes zipper clauses, which limit negotiations during the term of a union contract, mandatory subjects of bargaining,” according to Wagner.  The last decision, he writes, “states that when an expiring union contract is renewed indefinitely while parties negotiate on a new contract, that is effectively a new agreement that is subject to agency head review and implementation of new governmentwide rules and regulations.”  MORE: “Judge declines to stop rule requiring Michigan state employees to OK union dues annually,” from The Detroit News  Economy  ICYMI — SEPTEMBER JOBS REPORT: The unemployment rate dropped last month by half a percentage point to 7.9 percent.

This time around, approximately 1.5 million jobs had been lost since the pandemic hit, as of June,” Kellie writes.  CUTS AHEAD: Democrats, governors and labor groups have been calling for more aid for state budgets decimated by steep revenue drop-offs because of the pandemic. “Otherwise, they warn, more cuts are coming to essential services like education, health care and public safety that local economies need now more than ever,” Kellie adds.

Follow us on Twitter Rebecca Rainey @rebeccaarainey', 'More than a week after the gruesome murder of French teacher Samuel Paty by a Chechen refugee, France remains gripped by shock, hatred and despair. The terrorist attack, which followed Paty’s decision to show the controversial Charlie Hebdo caricatures of Prophet Muhammad in class, has intensified anti-Muslim sentiments.  Once again, France’s Muslim citizens find themselves at the heart of a debate that holds their religion and its symbols in contempt and smears and vilifies them in the political sphere, mainstream media and social media networks. And once again the ruling elite and a large part of the French society are in denial about the true roots of radicalisation.  But this time around, it seems the head of state is particularly intent on fanning the flames of Islamophobia. President Emmanuel Macron feels his electorate is abandoning him and thinks the only thing he that can save his political career is taking a page out of the far right’s playbook.  Macron’s faltering support  It is worth pointing out that the attack comes as France is suffering from a long-term social crisis that has been made worse by the failed policies of Macron’s government. Popular anger has reached the boiling point and manifested itself in street protests. In the spring of 2018, major public sector strikes took place followed by the Gilets Jaunes (yellow vests) protests in fall.  Then throughout 2019, there were major demonstrations against pension reforms, fuel-price hikes, police violence, and unemployment. The year ended with one of the longest public transportation strikes in French history, which paralysed the country.  This upheaval brought Macron’s ratings from approximately 60 percent when he was elected in May 2017 to 23 percent in December 2018. Before the pandemic mobilised French society earlier this year, the French president had the approval of about 33 percent of the people.  The slight gains Macron made at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis did not help his party in the June municipal elections, where it suffered a crushing defeat by the Greens movement in a number of large French cities.  The presidential election is scheduled for April 2022, and the French president is seemingly running out of time to come up with something that can help secure his re-election. His latest desperate attempt at gaining political ground – specifically at the expense of the far right – seems to be his decision to come after the Muslim community in France. He knows that anything that has to do with attacking Muslims galvanises the supporters of the far right and its racist and anti-Muslim agenda, as well as perhaps a good segment of the French left.  Thus, in early October, Macron made a special address to the nation in which he insisted that Islam “is in crisis” and that he was going to “liberate” it from foreign influences.  When the murder of Paty took place less than two weeks later, the French president was quick to seize the moment and declare he was going to take action to eradicate “Islamist extremism” in France.  A kneejerk reaction  In the aftermath of the attack, Macron and his government launched a crackdown on Muslim civil society – or what they called “extremists”. Among the measures they took were “several dozen concrete actions … against organisations, associations or individuals who carry a project of radical Islamism”.  As a result, more than 50 charities – including the Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF), a mainstream organisation that combats Islamophobia – dubbed by Minister of the Interior Gerald Darmanin as “enemies of the Republic”, may face dissolution.  Throughout the process, Macron and his government have kept up their Islamophobic rhetoric, setting the tone for the public debate on the terror attack.  Thus a chorus of media pundits and politicians across the political spectrum have apparently united in the conviction that the French “values” are under threat and that the general population needs to mobilise for a fight. “It is wartime!” declared one magazine on its front cover. “To arms, citizens” tweeted MP Meyer Habib, deputy chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee at the National Assembly, using a phrase from the French national anthem.  The “weapons” some suggested should be used in this “war” include the rescinding of citizenship, obligation to adopt French first names, the reinstatement of the death penalty, etc.  This belligerent rhetoric did not spare public figures who have come out in defence of the French Muslim community. In a TV debate, writer Pascal Bruckner accused journalist Rokhaya Diallo, whom he identified as a “Black Muslim woman” of having, through her words “led to the death of Charlie Hebdo’s 12 cartoonists”.  Jean-Luc Mélenchon, head of the France Insoumise (Unbowed France) party, has also faced a smear campaign since he has been warning against the stigmatisation of Muslims. He has been accused by the political establishment of being an Islamo-leftist in an attempt to undermine the Left by associating it with “Islamism”, which has a very negative connotation in the minds of the French majority.  Coincidentally or not, Mélenchon had emerged as a potential challenger to Macron in the next presidential election. If this character assassination campaign against him succeeds, Macron may have an easier time securing re-election.  The real problem  Amid this cacophony of Islamophobia and electoral scheming, the crux of the matter has not really been addressed.  For well over two decades, the French state has been moving in a vicious circle in its relationship with its Muslim citizens.  The state still does not acknowledge the fact that Islam is a religion of France, that it is not wise to systematically remind or refer to French Muslims by their racial or geographic origins, and that French Muslim issues are inherently French issues.  The state does not want to recognise the fact that there is no empirical evidence to suggest that religion is a primary motivator for violent extremism and that radicalisation is a social phenomenon.  It continues to use terrorist incidents as a distraction from its own failed policies towards French Muslim citizens which have led to the marginalisation and alienation of an entire community.  The state has done little to address job and housing discrimination, police brutality, poverty and everyday racism and yet it accuses the French Muslim community of failing to “integrate” or even of “separatism”.  It has relied on a security-centred approach in which Islam has been systematically perceived as an evil that society should confront, and Muslims as a threat to the way of life and to fundamental rights, such as freedom of expression.  For the majority of Muslims, the most blatant bias is that when it comes to criticising or mocking Islam and its symbols, the establishment’s definition of freedom of expression is universal, absolute and indisputable. While insisting that Muslims embrace criticism and mockery of what is sacred to them, it has very little tolerance for criticism of Israel, Israeli policies and Zionism.  If anything, it appears that it is the state rather than the Muslim citizens that is “separating” itself from a segment of society and is insisting on treating them as outsiders. It clearly does not want to acknowledge that multiculturalism is an integral part of French society and should be embraced as such.  Unfortunately, as long as the French state considers its Muslim citizens a “fifth column” and excludes them from its battle against extremism; and as long as the political establishment uses heinous terror attacks to make political gains ahead of elections, we will continue to be light years away from the Republic’s core principles of social cohesion, civil peace and dialogue.

Kamala Harris (D-CA), Democrat Joe Biden’s running mate for vice president, skipped a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing for United States Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett despite attending a number of indoor events on the campaign trail.  During her remarks on the first day of Barrett’s confirmation process, Harris blasted the hearing as “reckless” in the face of “a deadly, airborne virus,” referring to the Chinese coronavirus crisis.  “This hearing has brought together more than 50 people to sit inside of a closed-door room for hours while our nation is facing a deadly, airborne virus,” Harris said through a monitor as she sat in her office in California.  “This committee has ignored common sense requests to keep people safe, including not requiring testing for all members despite a coronavirus outbreak among senators of this very committee,” Harris continued. “… The decision to hold this hearing now is reckless and places facility workers, janitorial staff, and professional aides, and Capitol Police at risk.”  Despite claiming she skipped the hearing because of the risk of contracting the Chinese coronavirus, Harris has attended numerous indoor events packed with people including the recent vice presidential debate which featured an indoor audience and the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s funeral.  Harris made the accusations even as the majority of her Senate Democrat colleagues showed up to the hearing including senators who are much older than her like Sens.

In those 74 days, Biden and his transition team will conduct a full search to fill administration posts from chief of staff to members of his Cabinet. The president-elect and his team will be forced to navigate a wide variety of interests from the moderate Republicans that supported his campaign to the longtime Biden allies that are establishment Democrats to the vocal left wing of the Democratic Party, which is already making its demands for an ambitious progressive agenda.  \"Congratulations to @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris on your historic win!\" Rep.

A nation without borders is not a nation,” he said, echoing one of the more famous aphorisms attributed to the late President Ronald Reagan.  “So, on behalf of the United States, I’d like to extend my sincere, really sincere condolences to a friend of mine, President Macron of France, where they just… had a vicious, vicious, Islamic terrorist attack, beheading an innocent teacher near Paris,” the President continued.  “A horrible thing, and they’ve apprehended [I think] nine people, who knows — but we’ve been very, very strong on radical Islamic terrorism, and we do have a ban,” he added, referring to the travel ban his administration imposed on a number of Muslim-majority countries first identified as hotbeds of terrorism by the Obama-Biden administration.  “People said ‘oh, that’s such a terrible thing’, remember, when I put the ban on — and then we got sued, and we lost, lost, and then we won in the United States Supreme Court,” Trump recalled, eliciting cheers from the crowd.  “France is having a hard time, and Macron’s a great guy, and I just want to say, whatever we can do,” the President concluded.

The images were taken from the satirical Charlie Hebdo magazine, which saw its editor and many of its staff members massacred in their offices by Islamist gunmen in 2015, along with a police protection officer and a building maintenance worker.  The massacre in currently has been in the public eye again in France due to a number of people believe alleged to be connected to the killings having been out on trial in recent weeks.  Two people were attacked with a meat cleaver by a Pakistani migrant outside Charlie Hebdo‘s former offices when the trial began in September. He believed the magazine was still based there.  France, a member of the European Union borderless Schengen Area — once described as “effectively an international passport-free zone for terrorists” by former INTERPOL chief Robert Noble — is home to hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of illegal migrants and asylum seekers, many of them currently massed on the country’s northern coast awaiting opportunities to cross the English Channel to the United Kingdom in small boats.  Thousands of the migrants and their supporters rallied openly on the streets of the French capital just a day after Samuel Paty’s beheading, demanding the government regularise their presence through some form of amnesty.

Seventy-two percent of them reported that they had lost all of their clients by the first week of April, according to a survey by the National Domestic Workers Alliance. The fortunate had employers who continued to pay them. The unlucky called or texted their employers and heard nothing back. They weren’t laid off so much as ghosted, en masse.  The article, and the quoted pro-migration activists, only hinted at the hypocrisy of elites who applaud migration and diversity but discard their illegal migrant employees without warning or compensation.  But the article also sidelined the damage done to Americans’ labor market by the creation of several underclass workforces within the U.S. labor market. For example, the article glossed over the reality that employers know they can hire low-wage illegals at minimal legal risk, so undermining the hard-won labor market rights of Americans.  The article said:  [In 1950] domestic work was finally added to the Social Security Act, and by the 1970s it had been added to federal legislation intended to protect laborers, including the Fair Labor Standards Act. African-American women had won many of those protections by organizing, though by the 1980s, they had moved into other occupations and were largely replaced by women from South and Central America as well as the Caribbean.  The passive-voice phrase “were largely replaced” hides the rarely-noted movement in the 1970s and 1980s by upper-income whites to hire illegal, grateful, and compliant Latinos instead of proud American citizens — mostly blacks — for domestic chores.  “The reporter seems to be avoiding the question of why the American women, having won these new worker protections, just coincidentally happened to stop working in this field and be replaced by Hispanic women,” said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors reduced immigration and tight labor markets. He added:  Maybe it was just a coincidence, but it doesn’t seem like it, and it surely is a question that you would want to at least raise in an article like this. The problem is that it would be “setting one minority group against another.” I am not going to head-shrink the person, but I would suspect this is an example of [George Orwell’s idea of “Thought]-crime stop”: It never even occurred to the reporter to pursue that because pursuing that question would lead to potentially unpleasant findings.  Many employers also hired white-collar visa workers instead of Americans. At least one million H-1B, J-1, OPT, and L-1 workers are part of the green card economy because they work hard for lower wages in the hope of getting paid with green cards and citizenship. Congress created that economy, at the request of business leaders, partly because it greatly reduces job opportunities, bargaining power, and salaries for American graduates.  Established media outlets rarely note how the huge supply of imported legal and illegal workers shifts economic power and money towards employers and away from employees. But one of the pro-migration activists cited in the New York Times acknowledged that the huge supply of workers in the sector makes it difficult for the workers to bargain for decent wages:  Premilla Nadasen, the author of “Household Workers Unite” and a professor of history at Barnard College … [said] “The imbalance of power between employer and employee has been magnified by the pandemic because millions of people are now looking for work. And xenophobic rhetoric has made women more fearful of being deported.”  “She’s admitting that loose labor markets are bad for workers,” said Krikorian. “Black American women won those labor rights earlier on not because they marched louder or had better protest signs,” he said, adding:  It was because people who wanted domestic workers didn’t have any real choice [of alternative workers]. The black women in the 1950s and 1960s had market power, and the employers responded to that market power rationally by conceding some of the demands. Once the [workers] lost that market power because of mass immigration — legal and illegal — employers again responded rationally and withdrew those benefits.  The article echoes the calls by advocates for a federal bailout of the illegal migrant economy that has been embraced by many progressives and business groups, and by city leaders in wealthy coastal cities:  “We plateaued at about 40 percent employment in our surveys of members,” said Ai-jen Poo, executive director of the alliance. “And because most of these people are undocumented, they have not received any kind of government relief. We’re talking about a full-blown humanitarian crisis, a Depression-level situation for this work force.”  “The coronavirus shutdown was going to be bad regardless,” responded Krikorian, continuing:  But the effects have clearly been exacerbated [by immigration], not just because there are lots of immigrants, but because mass immigration has created this gig economy where jobs are not institutionalized. If you were a live-in domestic helper in the 1940s or 1950s, you’d be a lot less likely to be thrown out on the street when there’s an economic slowdown. I’m not saying it was all wonderful and roses, but it was a more institutionalized arrangement. Whereas if you’re hiring a house cleaner [in today’s gig economy], and when you can’t afford it anymore, or you have to tighten your belt, it’s easy to just cross them off your list. Mass immigration over the years has made that kind of arrangement much easier to maintain, and so when there’s a downturn … It’s just easier to dispose of people that way.  The demand for a bailout of the illegal migrant economy comes amid an increasing recognition that legal and illegal migration inflates the wealth of the coastal states at the expense of the interior states.', 'Nearly half of the young people in North Africa and the Middle East say they are either actively trying to migrate or are considering migrating to another country, according to the 12th ASDA’A BCW Arab Youth Survey.  The survey, which interviewed 4,000 people aged 18 to 24 across 17 states in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), found that 42 per cent of those polled wanted to leave their home countries and migrate elsewhere, and 40 per cent have thought of moving to another country in a permanent basis.  Fifteen per cent of the respondents said they have taken active measures to move to another country, and only 32 per cent said that they would never leave their country.  Up to Two-Thirds of Sub-Saharan Africa’s 1.1 Billion People Want to Migrate to the EU, U.S. https://t.co/RfoTgRESxP — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 23, 2018  Lebanon saw the highest rate of young people wanting to leave at 77 per cent, followed by Libya at 69 per cent, Yemen at 66 per cent, and Iraq ar 65 per cent.  Around a quarter of the youth said that they wanted to move for economic reasons while factors commonly associated with refugee status such as religious or political reasons scored just two per cent and eight per cent respectively. Security issues scored slightly higher at 12 per cent.  The Wuhan coronavirus has also had an impact on attitudes towards migrating, with 32 per cent of the youths saying the virus has made it more likely they want to move abroad. In Lebanon, the figure was far higher, at 77 per cent.  Similar surveys taken in recent years have also shown a strong desire to migrate in other regions such as sub-Saharan Africa. In 2018, a Pew Research Center study revealed that as many as two-thirds of sub-Saharan African’s 1.1 billion people wanted to migrate to either Europe or the United States within a five year period.  Many within the European Union and its member states have long argued for more legal ways to encourage migration from regions such as Africa. French President Emmanuel Macron had said in 2018 that population growth in the continent will lead to an “unprecedented” age of mass migration.  Macron: Europe Entering Age of ‘Unprecedented’ Mass Migration, ‘Shares Destiny’ with Africa  https://t.co/pg9tmMbJBC — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 17, 2018', 'Could that help produce the sort of youth turnout in this election that we last saw in 2008, when Barack Obama’s first presidential run inspired young people to pour out to the polls in unprecedented numbers?  The answer to this might be yes, according to a new poll of 18- to 29-year-olds from the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics.  The poll finds that among likely voters in that 18-to-29 demographic, Biden is leading President Trump by 60 percent to 27 percent among likely voters. That’s significantly better than the 49 percent that Hillary Clinton got in this poll in 2016.  But that’s not all. The poll also finds that an astonishing 63 percent of respondents say they will “definitely be voting,” compared to 47 percent in the 2016 version of this poll.  That matches 2008 levels. The 2008 version of this poll found that among a somewhat smaller segment of young voters, approximately the same percentage said they’d definitely be voting.  While this comparison between the two subsets isn’t perfect, it nonetheless indicates that it’s reasonable to posit that 18- to 29-year-olds might post 2008-level turnout this time, according to Chase Harrison, the acting director of the Institute of Politics poll.  “I would assume that we should see actual turnout among 18-to-29 year-olds similar to actual turnout in 2008,” Harrison told me. “Young voters care about this election.” If so, that would be striking.  Now here a wrinkle intrudes: In 2008, in the end turnout among young voters was somewhat lower than what they indicated in this poll (since not all voters who say they will vote end up doing so).  But still, in 2008 the turnout among this youth demographic ended up being 48.4 percent of eligible voters, according to data from University of Florida demographer Michael McDonald.  That dwarfs youth turnout in any election going back at least to the mid-1980s. If that replicates itself, it could give a lift to efforts to defeat Trump.  Here another wrinkle intrudes: The poll also finds that enthusiasm for Biden is lagging a bit, with 44 percent of young Trump voters being very enthusiastic about voting for him while 30 percent of young Biden voters say the same.  Despite this, not only is Biden winning by 2-to-1 among these voters; the overall demographic is promising 2008 levels of turnout. How can this be?  Harrison suggests that it might be rooted in recent events.  “This is a cohort that has been in many ways uniquely affected by covid,” Harrison told me. “Many younger voters have had their entry into the labor market delayed. They’re facing all sorts of challenges.”  Harrison pointed out that many young voters might have more of an identification with young immigrants who were brought here illegally as children and thus enjoyed the Obama-era protections for “dreamers” that Trump has tried to destroy. He noted that this cohort is more racially and ethnically diverse than even the 18-to-29 year-olds who rallied behind Obama the first time.  And, of course, for many young voters, the protests that have swept the country might be their first serious experience of political activism and engagement, similar to how the young people who rallied behind Obama were galvanized by opposition to the Iraq War.  “Many of the things that people have been concerned about with Donald Trump have been observed more closely by 18- to 29-year-olds,” Harrison said.  Trump, of course, has botched the coronavirus crisis with unique awfulness, even as he’s actively sought to incite a backlash against the protests, which has included unleashing federal law enforcement and threatening to send troops into major cities. And so, if youth turnout really does have a chance of attaining 2008 levels, perhaps this will constitute another way Trump has made his own comeuppance more likely.', 'Washington (CNN) An ardent opponent of the US military\\'s presence in Afghanistan who once called for the use of lethal force against illegal immigrants and has made a litany of racist comments has been made a senior adviser at the Pentagon.  A Pentagon spokesman confirmed Wednesday that retired Army Col. Douglas Macgregor \"will be serving as a Senior Advisor to the Acting Secretary of Defense. Mr. MacGregor\\'s decades of military experience will be used to assist in the continued implementation of the President\\'s national security priorities.\"  Macgregor\\'s appointment is the latest in a series of sweeping changes at the Pentagon that has put defense officials on edge and fueled a growing sense of alarm among military and civilian officials, who are concerned about what could come next.  Four senior Pentagon officials have been fired or have resigned since Monday, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper who was fired in a tweet by President Donald Trump, Esper\\'s chief of staff and the top officials overseeing policy and intelligence.  The moves will likely only add to the sense of chaos within the Pentagon following Trump\\'s firing of Esper, which came two days after his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, was projected as the winner of the presidential election -- a conclusion that Trump has refused to accept.  Esper was replaced by Christopher Miller, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center.  Those who assumed new roles included controversial retired Brig. Gen. Anthony Tata, who moved into the Pentagon\\'s top policy role, taking over the duties of James Anderson, who resigned Tuesday, according to another US defense official.  Macgregor has been a vocal opponent of the US military\\'s mission in Afghanistan and has called for a total withdrawal of US troops and the American Embassy despite the continued presence of terrorist groups there.  Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky who is a strong advocate of withdrawing US troops welcomed the appointment.  \"I am very pleased @realDonaldTrump asked my friend Col. Doug Macgregor to help quickly end the war in Afghanistan. This and other picks for Pentagon are about getting the right people who will finally help him stop our endless wars,\" Paul tweeted.  Knowledgeable sources told CNN\\'s Jake Tapper on Tuesday that the White House-directed purge at the Defense Department may have been motivated by the fact Esper and his team were pushing back on a premature withdrawal from Afghanistan that would be carried out before the required conditions on the ground were met, and other pending security issues.  US military officials have long stressed that the US withdrawal from Afghanistan is conditions based, with those conditions including the Taliban\\'s breaking its ties to al Qaeda and making progress in peace talks with the Afghan government, two conditions that have yet to be met.  But despite the lack of progress, the Trump administration has already substantially reduced US troops in the country by more than 50%, bringing the number of US military personnel there down to about 4,500, the lowest levels since the earliest days of the post 9/11 campaign.  Trump\\'s national security adviser, Robert O\\'Brien, has advocated for a more accelerated withdrawal from Afghanistan irrespective of conditions on the ground, something made more feasible by the installation of White House loyalists in senior defense posts.  He has also called for an immediate end to the US military effort in Syria, where a small number of US troops back the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in their fight against ISIS.  Macgregor advocated for the use of lethal force against unarmed migrants  Macgregor once advocated for the use of lethal force against unarmed migrants to deter illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America.  He was nominated by Trump this summer to be the ambassador to Germany but faced fierce opposition for his remarks uncovered by CNN\\'s KFILE  KFILE reviewed dozens of radio and television interviews with Macgregor and found he often demonized immigrants and refugees. He warned Mexican cartels were \"driving millions of Mexicans with no education, no skills and the wrong culture into the United States, placing them essentially as wards of the American people.\" He repeatedly advocated instituting martial law at the US-Mexico border and to \"shoot people\" if necessary.  He also said that Eastern Ukrainians are \"Russians\" on the Russian state-controlled TV network RT in 2014 after Russia tried to annex Crimea and began an ongoing war with Ukraine over the territory -- positions not supported by the European Union and United States. He lamented that the US government intervened against Serbian forces, who engaged in ethnic cleansing and war crimes, during the Kosovo War in the 1990s to \"put, essentially, a Muslim drug mafia in charge of that country.\"  This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday and Thursday.', 'House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have not yet forged a compromise on a coronavirus stimulus bill but negotiations continue.  \"We\\'re at the table discussing how we go forward with a possible COVID bill,\" Pelosi said at a news conference Thursday.  \"We\\'re hopeful that we can reach agreement because the needs of the American people are so great,\" the top House Democrat added. \"But there has to be a recognition that it takes money to do that.\"  MCCONNELL ON CORONAVIRUS RELIEF DEAL: \\'WE ARE VERY, VERY FAR APART\\'  Pelosi signaled the House would move forward with a vote as soon as Thursday on the Democrats\\' latest offer: a $2.2 trillion relief bill. If passed, it would be the second bill the House passed since May to address the pandemic while the Senate has failed to advance anything.  The House was prepared to pass the legislation Wednesday, but the vote was delayed in case Pelosi and Mnuchin could forge a new bipartisan compromise.  \"We are not finished,\" Pelosi said of the state of talks. \"I\\'m hopeful. But we do come at it from two different places.\"  MNUCHIN, PELOSI MAKE LAST-DITCH PUSH FOR CORONAVIRUS RELIEF DEAL AHEAD OF NOVEMBER ELECTION  Mnuchin had been negotiating on behalf of the White House, while Senate Republicans have rejected any new massive spending bill over concerns of the rising deficit. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday called the Democrats\\' latest offer of $2.2 trillion \"outlandish\" and suggested his GOP majority wants to stay around $500 billion.  SECOND ROUND OF STIMULUS CHECKS WOULD BE INCLUDED IN CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL: MNUCHIN  The House originally passed a $3.4 trillion bill in May known as the HEROES Act -- the largest spending bill on record in U.S. history. But the Senate rebuked the legislation as an overpriced liberal wish list. McConnell offered up two counter-proposals in the months since at $1 trillion and about $300 billion, respectively, but neither could pass the Senate as Democrats said the effort didn\\'t meet the gravity of the pandemic.  The $2.2 trillion House bill up for a vote, known as HEROES 2.0, would give Americans an economic lifeline as previous coronavirus relief programs have dried up.  HOUSE DEMOCRATS\\' NEW CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL ELIMINATES $600M FOR POLICING: \\'IT\\'S SHAMEFUL\\'  The legislation would provide additional direct payments of $1,200 per taxpayer (included undocumented immigrants who pay taxes) and $500 per dependent, restore unemployment benefits of $600 weekly federal assistance through January and revive the Paycheck Protection Program to serve the smallest businesses and struggling nonprofits.', 'The 2020 election finds the United States teetering past partisanship toward complete polarization.

It\\'s up to all of us.  \"I think it\\'s quite possible to become more united and demonstrably so,\" says Ken Abraham, a former deputy attorney general from Dover, Delaware, who supports Biden. \"Some of my friends – they’re still friends of mine. I’m smart enough to not let politics interfere with real friendship, but some of them are Trump supporters and, man, it’s just hard to understand. But we have to forget past transgressions and move forward with an eye toward the future, what’s best for the country.\"  The hostility among Americans is palpable. I struggle with how far we\\'ve fallen in American culture – how we treat each other, how we\\'ve allowed our shared values to deteriorate. What do we want our country to be? What do we stand for? How do we want to be remembered?  The fundamental division in our country seems to be between people who are comfortable with the changing face of America and those who are fearful of losing status. A June More in Common poll shows that 82% of Americans say the nation as a whole is more divided than united.

Instead, she lists the transgressions against her family: The Oakland County residents nailed a Trump sign to their front-yard tree three years ago. Somebody drove by and threw yellow paint on it.  This year, they nailed a Trump 2020 sign and an American flag below the original sign. Somebody spray-painted an expletive on the Trump sign and blacked out the flag. A stranger then nailed a handmade, backlit, glass-covered Trump 2020 sign to their tree. Within a week, somebody came with a baseball bat and smashed it. A giant blue ribbon wrapped around a tree to show support from law enforcement also was vandalized with spray paint, she said.  \"We left everything up there because we felt it made a better statement about the world we’re living in than taking it down,\" Maddock told me this week. \"Just because we support Trump, we’re being attacked.\"  I pushed back a bit, questioning whether Maddock and her husband, state Rep. Matt Maddock, could have been targeted because of their vocal activism. After all, they founded the Michigan Conservative Coalition and organized a massive demonstration at the Capitol to protest the stay-at-home order that Gov. Gretchen Whitmer implemented to fight coronavirus spread.  \"You\\'re right,\" she said. \"We\\'re probably not your average Trump supporter. But we hear all the time of things like this happening in people\\'s yards and houses.\"  I kept digging for answers. I stressed that nothing will be accomplished if we can\\'t even have a civil discussion with each other. I wanted to hear from an outspoken Trump champion why her perspective was so pessimistic, even dark. Maddock acknowledged that she didn\\'t see a path to unity as a country, instead describing what Democrats want as \"submission.\" But as we talked – and listened to each other – she softened.  \"I\\'d like to think that my fellow Republicans are open to hearing both sides and to a discussion,\" she said. \"One by one, it\\'s easier to talk to people.\"  Filled with anxiety  Six hundred miles to the east, Emily Golden, a newly minted graduate of George Washington University\\'s Elliott School of International Affairs, lay awake every night this summer monitoring her cellphone, rapt by the footage of the social unrest and protests playing out in cities across America.  Golden, 22, who had returned home to New York City because of the coronavirus pandemic, said she felt powerless, filled with anxiety and uncertainty about her country. Things have only gotten worse: COVID-19 continues to ravage and kill; the economy has tanked; millions have lost their jobs and are losing their homes; wildfires have scorched a large swath of the landscape; and one of the most contentious presidential elections in American history has exacerbated an already deep gulf among us.  \"Not to be dramatic, but I felt I would be in bed every single night looking at this little electronic rectangle, watching society fall apart,\" Golden told me this week. \"It was such a helpless feeling. And these are such complex, systemic issues. How could one person do anything about that? I felt like I couldn\\'t make a difference and it’s hopeless forever.\"  Golden decided to spend Election Day at a polling place at a junior high school on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She served as a greeter, checking in people before they voted.  \"Working the polls and trying to get this administration out was very important to me,\" she said. \"The system is made up of individuals, and I can be one of those individuals that helps change something. I can finally say I’m doing something instead of feeling like I can’t do anything.\"  A common enemy  Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman has an answer for bringing Americans together: Unite around a common enemy, the coronavirus. Instead of fighting each other, Fetterman said, we should be laser focused on eradicating the virus, not arguing about mask wearing, social distancing or the validity of any future vaccine.  “It’s a virus – it’s not going to respond to politics,\" Fetterman told me. \"We could get angry at this virus and what it’s done in terms of taking what will be 300,000 lives and trillions of our dollars. I just think there’s some political issues that we’re never really going to agree on but we’ve got to get back to this. Fighting the virus is our training wheels, and then if we master that, we can take those off and try to be more unified on these other things.\"  In our echo chambers  I’ve never watched more cable news than I have in the past eight months. Mostly this is because I’ve been working from home since March, and I usually have the television on in the background. I’ve been struck by how partisan the broadcast landscape is.  Fox News\\' Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity adore Trump every bit as much as CNN’s Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo abhor him. As I observe, I can’t help but think that cable news is the epitome of an echo chamber.  I attempt to “both sides” my viewing, but I find it impossible to believe that most typical Americans are doing the same. If you’re watching Fox News, particularly in prime time, you’re probably doing so because you align with that network’s conservative news commentary. No needle is being moved. No minds are being changed.Demonization of opponents is part of the business model.  Social media aren\\'t much better.Most people joined social media platforms to engage with family and friends, to follow things and people that interested them, maybe even to share baby and pet pictures. Today, Facebook and Twitter can only be described as a dumpster fire. The name calling and open insults are appalling.  Americans have to find a way to pivot from the noise that surrounds us, said Rene Elsbury, a licensed social worker for Families First, an Indianapolis-based organization that provides mental health services. When thinking about the polarization we have seen during the political process, we\\'ve lost sight of American values of public health and social justice. Those important issues have devolved to picking a side – red or blue, she said.  \"A screen makes an argument so much less personal,\" Elsbury said. \"If we’re arguing into our phone, our laptop or tablet, we disconnect the humanity that is on the other side. And we’re all humans. We all have opinions. We all disagree. A political viewpoint is one aspect of a human being. So can we find the good in others? Can we find the good that can outweigh the bad?\"  We are resilient  Calvin Malone, 57, has spent weeks in his barber shop in Franklin, Tennessee, talking politics with his customers – the few customers he still has. Malone, who has been in business for 30 years, said the coronavirus has left many without jobs. Those who used to get weekly haircuts now pay him a visit maybe every month. He describes this time in America as \"the worst I\\'ve ever seen it.\" His answer to combating the political agitation and public anxiety: prayer.  \"We’re going to need some Jesus on both sides – that’s the only way I can see it,\" Malone told me. \"A whole bunch of people are going to be mad if Trump is in. A whole bunch of people are going to be mad if Biden is in. We are just going to have to ask the Lord to give us an understanding mind. We are going to need people to soften their hearts and ask for a clear understanding.\"  Whether we look to spiritual guidance or tangible outcomes, we can and should do better. We are resilient. We are capable of showing respect and empathy. America, moving forward, we’re only as divided as we choose to be. It won\\'t be easy to unite and heal, but when that final vote is counted, that\\'s precisely what we must do.  National columnist Suzette Hackney is a member of USA TODAY’S Editorial Board.

Gov. John Fetterman, said she was subjected to xenophobic and racist insults in a confrontation she captured briefly on video and posted to Twitter.  Gisele Fetterman, a formerly undocumented immigrant from Brazil who became an American citizen in 2009, said she went to an Aldi’s near her home to buy kiwis.  While standing in line to check out, Fetterman said she was accosted by a woman who said, “There’s that (n-word) that Fetterman married” and called the state\\'s second lady a thief who did not belong here.  Fetterman, 38, said she was unaccompanied by her “amazing” security team because the family was in on a rainy Sunday night and she was just darting out “for what I thought would be a five-minute trip to the grocery store.”  John Fetterman is the former mayor of Braddock, and the couple still live there with their three children.  On Monday, Fetterman told the USA TODAY Network that the woman would hurl insults, walk away and then return to continue the verbal barrage. A woman standing behind her asked if she was alone and warned her to not walk to her car alone, Fetterman said.  She was too upset to notify employees, Fetterman said. “I just wanted to get out of there and get home,” she said.  Read more on race and identity: Sign up for USA TODAY’s This Is America newsletter  Fetterman said she paid for her kiwis and looked for the woman, but did not see her. As she was backing her car out of her parking space, Fetterman said the woman came out of the store empty-handed and headed for her car.  Shaking and crying, Fetterman said she reached for her phone to record the incident, but only managed to capture the last few seconds in which the woman pulls down her mask and says, “You’re a (n-word).”  Since Sunday’s incident, Fetterman said she has heard from other residents who reported similar racist incidents with the woman, some involving children.  “This behavior and this hatred is taught,” Fetterman posted on Twitter on Sunday. “If you know her, if she is our neighbor or relative, please, please teach her love instead.”  Fetterman reiterated those feelings on Monday, saying that she worries the woman could be teaching her grandchildren how to hate others.  “She does not reflect the majority and there’s comfort in that,” Fetterman said. “I only love my country more. It just makes me want to fight more for my country.”  Fetterman said her state police security team is investigating the incident.  Gov. Tom Wolf released a statement Monday condemning the incident and saying Fettermanhas the “full support” of him and his wife, Frances.  “Racism and hate speech are always unacceptable, and unworthy of Pennsylvanians,” Wolf said  “No Pennsylvanian should ever be made to feel unwelcome in our commonwealth because of their race or ethnicity,” Wolf added. “Gisele Fetterman spends much of her time devoted to making our state and world a better place and she – and every Pennsylvanian – deserves our respect, not the hatred too often displayed by people who seek only to further divide this country at a time when unity is so desperately needed.  John Fetterman replied to that tweet with one of his own, saying that he was \"deeply grateful\" to Wolf for supporting his wife.  U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Scranton, posted about the incident on Twitter Sunday night.  “Today at the grocery store, PA’s Second Lady @giselefetterman was subjected to a racial slur and taunts. As she said: ‘this hatred is taught.’ It’s on us to teach our children kindness, acceptance and inclusion, and condemn hate whenever and wherever we see it,” Casey wrote.  Follow J.D.

Economics student Sanaa Mohammed told CBS News that, while she felt it was important for her vote in Jordan, the U.S. election has \"far reaching effects\" on the Arab world.  \"We all follow the news in America,\" she said after voting at a polling station in central Amman. \"I am so happy that Biden won.\"  Jordan\\'s King Abdullah II was quick to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden after the race was called by CBS News and other major media outlets on Saturday.

Jordan opposed the Middle East peace plan offered by the Trump administration, as well as its decision to freeze U.S. contributions to UNRWA, the United Nations agency that helps Palestinian refugees, of whom Jordan hosts about 2 million — more than any other nation.  \"The Trump administration treated Jordan as collateral damage,\" Dr. Marwan Muasher, a former Jordanian foreign minister who is now the vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment. He predicted that \"the new president is going to spend most of his time either on domestic issues or, when it comes to international issues, on repairing the gap with the Europeans and having that new relationship with China.\"  Muasher said he believes, however, that while the Middle East may rank low on the new administration\\'s priority list, \"a Biden administration is better for Jordan.\"  \"What we will see immediately is the ditching of the Trump plan and probably the restoration of aid to UNRWA and restarting contacts with the Palestinians. But beyond that, I don\\'t think we will see much,\" added Muasher, who also served as Jordan\\'s ambassador to Israel.  The Palestinian Authority was quick to welcome the news from the U.S., with President Mahmoud Abbas expressing hope of renewed ties under President-elect Biden.  Three years ago, Abbas cut off all direct contact with President Trump\\'s White House after the U.S. officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the U.S. Embassy to the holy city.  \"We don\\'t expect a miraculous transformation, but at least we expect the dangerous, destructive policies of Trump to totally stop,\" Dr. Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation\\'s Executive Committee, told the Reuters news agency. \"They should change course and deal with the Palestinian question on the bases of legality, equality and justice, and not on the basis of responding to special interests of pro-Israeli lobbies.\"  The Arab Opinion Index poll, published last month by the Qatar-based Arab Center for Research and Public Policy, found that \"81% [of Arabs] believe that the United States poses a threat to the security and stability of the region.\"  According to the pan-Arab opinion poll, the U.S. came a close second in that ranking after Israel, with Iran a distant third.  \"Now there is a sense of relief that Trump has lost,\" Dr. Mohammed Al Masri, Director of the Arab Opinion Index, told CBS News.  He said that with the change of administration, the perception of the U.S. in the Arab world would almost certainly change, at least in the short term.  \"This hopeful immediate reaction will be revisited in a few months,\" he cautioned, \"based on the implemented policies of Biden.\"  Dissenting opinions?  The Arab world is far from monolithic, and other leaders in the region might not be as optimistic as the Palestinians, or the King of Jordan.  Egypt\\'s military-backed President Abdul Fatah el-Sissi was the first Arab leader to congratulate Mr. Biden, but he is fully aware that the new administration may adopt a tougher stance regarding Egypt\\'s alleged human rights violations.  In July, Mr. Biden warned el-Sissi in a tweet, noting the long detention of a man arrested merely for holding a protest sign, that there would be, \"no more blank checks for Trump\\'s \"favorite dictator.\"\"  Mohamed Amashah is finally home after 486 days in Egyptian prison for holding a protest sign. Arresting, torturing, and exiling activists like Sarah Hegazy and Mohamed Soltan or threatening their families is unacceptable. No more blank checks for Trump’s \"favorite dictator.\" https://t.co/RtZkbGh6ik — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) July 12, 2020  A couple days before the U.S. elections, Egyptian authorities hastily released hundreds of prisoners that human rights organizations had classified as \"prisoners of conscience.\" Many human rights observers believe the move was made in anticipation of a possible Biden win.  Saudi Arabia\\'s King Salman and his son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman were late, but eventually did congratulate Mr. Biden on his projected election win. According to Saudi Arabia\\'s state news agency, \"King Salman praised the distinguished, historic and close relations between the two friendly countries and their people which everyone looks to strengthen and develop at all levels.\"  The United Nations has called for the Crown Prince, who has fostered close ties with President Trump, to be investigated personally over the brutal murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  During the election campaign, Mr. Biden pledged to reassess \"the relationship with the Kingdom, end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia\\'s war in Yemen, and make sure America does not check its values at the door to sell arms or buy oil.\"  Writing in the Al-Sharq al-Awsat newspaper, veteran Saudi columnist Abdulrahman Al-Rashed called Biden \"an expert in international affairs.\"  Al-Rashed added, however, that Mr. Biden \"needs the cooperation of the important regional powers in the world, and the role of Saudi Arabia is extremely important in consolidating stability in the region, and its role is important in the Islamic space.\"', 'Burger King has launched a new advertising campaign in Finland featuring its eponymous mascot sharing a deep kiss with Ronald McDonald, along with the English slogan ‘Love Conquers All’.  The image is front and centre on the landing page of the fast food chain’s Finnish website, with various outlets with a focus on advertising showing physical posters at locations such as public bus stops as well.  The campaign appears to be in aid of Helsinki Pride Week, which was moved to September from its usual slot due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. It also appears to have been influenced by the race politics of the Black Lives Matter movement, featuring the new version of the Pride flag topped with a black and brown stripe in order to “represent” non-white non-heterosexuals specifically.  “Burger King has always stood for equality, love and everyone’s right to be just the way they are,” claimed the burger-selling franchise’s brand manager in Finland, Kaisa Kasila.  “The only instance where it might not seem so, is when we’re bantering with our competitor. But we want to be clear – it all stems from the respect we have for them. And we know McDonald’s stands for the values we stand for, too,” Kasila added.  “We thought, what a better way to convey our values than by portraying an all-encompassing kiss between Burger King and McDonald. We wanted to show that in the end, love always wins.”  Ben & Jerry’s Receives Backlash for Backing Illegal Channel Migrants https://t.co/C4XEAo5Em4 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 14, 2020  Burger King is by no means the only multi-national enterprises to indulge in advertising campaigns which have much to do with politics and social justice causes and little to do with their core business in recent years.  Just this August, for example, Unilever-owned Ben & Jerry’s launched into a tirade against the British government on social media for his rhetoric — but not action — against the steadily worsening Channel migrant crisis, which has seen waves of up to 416 migrants a day crossing to England from France in small boats daily.  “[W]e think the real crisis is our lack of humanity for people fleeing war, climate change and torture,” the ice-cream sellers lectured in a lengthy Twitter thread — heedless of the fact that illegal aliens are not facing war or torture in France, and that climate change, such as it is, is the same on both sides of the English Channel.  This fashion for mammoth corporate interests indulging in divisive left-wing political activism has been dubbed “woke capitalism” by critics.  Delingpole: Unilever’s Ben & Jerry’s Should Drop the Wokesplaining and Stick to Ice-Cream https://t.co/pcA5imUWCM — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 12, 2020  Follow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBM ontgomery', 'The continuing controversy over \"Cuties\" – a French film designed as a commentary about the \"hypersexualization of children\" that instead has been condemned for exploiting it – may have helped dent Netflix\\'s solid growth.  The streaming giant Wednesday said it gained just 2.2 million global subscribers in the three months ended Sept. 30 – and just 180,000 in the U.S. – after adding 16 million from January to March and 10 million from April to June. The third-quarter gain is less than the 2.5 million Netflix forecast to analysts in July.  The sharp gains earlier this year were attributed in part to shutdowns from the coronavirus pandemic, and Netflix warned last summer that it expected growth to slow as lockdowns eased and competition intensified from new services, including Comcast\\'s free Peacock.  It\\'s impossible to attribute the lower numbers directly to the \"Cuties\"-inspired boycott drive. But at least two analytics firms said last month their data showed Netflix was suffering higher \"churn\" rates, which measure subscription cancellations, in the immediate aftermath of a #CancelNetflix movement that began online.  The company now counts 195 million subscribers, of which 73 million are in North America, and expects the global total to top 200 million by year\\'s end.  Backstory:Netflix charged with promoting lewdness in \\'Cuties.\\' So what happens next?  Netflix did not develop or produce \"Cuties,\" but acquired distribution rights to the film, which earned strong reviews and a director\\'s award at Sundance Film Festival. Director Maïmouna Doucouré told Time the film is a social commentary and part of the battle against \"hypersexualization of children.\"  Much of the backlash stemmed from promotional material depicting the young cast in suggestive dance poses with bare midriffs and short shorts, especially an image that appeared on the Netflix home page to promote the film when it began streaming on Sept. 9. Netflix pulled the image after outcry, saying it was \"deeply sorry\" for the \"inappropriate\" artwork.  The backstory:\\'Cuties\\': Here\\'s why the controversial Netflix film became a combatant in America\\'s culture war  Since then, at least four state attorneys general asked Netflix to pull the film; Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) urged a criminal investigation; Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said he was unsatisfied with Netflix\\'s apology; and a Texas grand jury indicted Netflix earlier this month for promoting \"lewd material of children.\"', 'But just because the court is a thoroughly American institution, that doesn’t mean its impact stops at U.S. borders. Its decisions affect foreign citizens, and the political wrangling over its future will resonate globally for years.  The brewing battle over the seat vacated by liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on Friday at the age of 87, is being watched closely by international legal experts. President Trump has pledged to move forward with a high court nominee before the November election, potentially enshrining an overwhelming conservative majority on the court.  “Justice Ginsburg was a globally significant jurist,” Adam Goldenberg, a lawyer at McCarthy Tétrault in Toronto and former clerk at the Canadian Supreme Court told Today’s WorldView. “This story is going to captivate people in our profession around the world.”  Decisions made by the Supreme Court can have significant practical impact abroad, especially when they involve commercial or administrative law. They can also affect people outside U.S. borders even when rulings come down to interpretations of the U.S. Constitution.  One high-profile ruling in June 2018 found that the president has the authority to ban travelers from majority-Muslim countries if he thinks it necessary.  The impact of domestic politics on the court in that decision was hard to miss. A Republican-led Senate had blocked the appointment of the Obama administration’s nominee to the court after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016, which would have resulted in a liberal majority.  The conservative who eventually replaced Scalia, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, was among the five who sided with the government — ultimately upholding a travel ban activists say has affected hundreds of millions of people overseas.  The Court is slated to hear more cases with clear international implications soon. This summer it agreed to take up a case that would decide whether foreign plaintiffs could use a 1789 law to sue U.S. corporations for alleged human rights abuses that occurred abroad.  The case, due to be heard in December, revolves around allegations that the U.S. company Cargill and the American branch of Nestle had allowed the use of child slave labor on cocoa farms in Ivory Coast. David Orentlicher, a law professor at University of Nevada at Las Vegas, said that the “the implications for holding domestic corporations liable are huge” and he could see deep divisions among Justices.  Other forthcoming cases with international implications include one relating to artwork stolen from Jewish art dealers by Nazi Germany and property taken during World War II by the Hungarian government. The current governments of Germany and Hungary are parties to these cases.  Despite their ideological divides it is not always clear how Justices will rule in cases outside of constitutional law. FiveThirtyEight reported this summer that the Court’s decisions had been in line with public opinion in all but two cases last term.  But there are cases with international implications where a new conservative justice could shift the landscape. In June, the Court rejected the Trump administration’s attempt to dismantle the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, a program that protected undocumented immigrants who entered the United States as children.  The decision to protect the DACA program was one of two cases this year that saw Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., considered a conservative, side with Ginsburg and other liberals in a 5-to-4 ruling that rested on administrative law. Trump has decried these moves as “shotgun blasts” into the faces of Republicans.  The Trump administration has shown no signs of giving up its fight against DACA. But ending protection for up to 650,000 DACA participants would have considerable international implications: Some “dreamers” who left the United States preemptively have described rough transitions to life in their old homes.  Despite its capacity for global impact, the Supreme Court can be an insular institution. During the Senate confirmation hearings for now-Justice Sonia Sotomayor in 2009, there were fierce debates about the extent to which the court should cite foreign law in its own rulings, which was viewed as “radical” by some.  Here, the loss of Ginsburg may be felt, too. Along with Justice Stephen G. Breyer (who wrote a book on the subject), she advocated for the Supreme Court taking a more international view of its responsibilities. University of Chicago professor Paul Poast argued that it was one of the key legacies she left behind.  The Court still has isolationist tendencies. Oona Hathaway, a professor at Yale Law School, said she thought the 2009 debate had “scared a lot of justices away from citing foreign judgments. And it’s hard to write about international law if you can’t cite foreign judgments.”  The story cuts the other way, too. Though the court’s power remains considerable, its prestige has been waning for years. In 2008, the New York Times’ Adam Liptak observed that American legal influence was declining, with citations of U.S. law in Canada and Australia dropping sharply as “sophisticated constitutional courts,” often more liberal than the U.S. court, rose elsewhere.  Others suggested the problem was not just the court itself, but disdain for U.S. policy. “It’s not surprising, given our foreign policy in the last decade or so, that American influence should be declining,” Thomas Ginsburg, then a law professor at the University of Chicago, told Liptak.  Goldenberg, the Canadian lawyer, said that the focus on textualism and originalism in U.S. constitutional law meant the Supreme Court’s decisions offered little guidance to foreign legal experts. And though many lawyers will be watching the battle for Ginsburg’s seat, it’s not something they’d want for themselves.  “You won’t find many lawyers outside the United States who envy the American nomination and confirmation process,” he said.', '(CNN) A 25-year-old woman in Australia discovered she had tapeworm larvae in her brain after suffering from a headache that lasted for more than a week.  The aches were caused by tapeworm larvae that had taken up space in her brain, according to a new study on her case by the The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene published on September 21.  The woman, who never traveled overseas, is the first native case of the disease in Australia, the study said. Previous Australian cases of this infection were from immigrants or returning residents who traveled to regions where the disease is endemic to, such as Africa, Asia, and Latin America.  For the past seven years, the woman complained of headaches that would occur two- or three-times a month and went away with prescribed migraine medication. However, her latest headache lasted for more than a week and came with more severe visual symptoms, including the blurring of her central vision.  An MRI of her brain led doctors to believe that a tumor might be the cause of her pain, but after operating and removing the lesion, they discovered it was actually a cyst full of tapeworm larvae. After the removal, she required no further treatment.  Read More', 'Amid all that, the pope says, the notion of a kinder, more respecting world “sounds like madness.”  But with the release Sunday of his third encyclical, a book-length paper that feels like something from a bygone time, Francis makes an uncynical case for how people can reverse course. The document amounts to a papal stand against tribalism, xenophobia, and the dangers of the social media age. It also marks a test for Francis in the eighth year of his papacy, at a time when his message has become familiar, and is often overshadowed by the louder voices he warns about.  The coronavirus has put a near-halt to the public events that had become Francis’s hallmark. The pope began writing the encyclical, called “Fratelli Tutti,” or “Brothers All,” before the pandemic. But he argues that the world’s response to the crisis shows the depth of humanity’s mistrust and fractures.  “For all our hyper-connectivity, we witnessed a fragmentation that made it more difficult to resolve problems that affect us all,” he writes.  For Americans, certain passages will likely read as a warning against Trump-style politics. Those sentiments come as little surprise to anybody who has listened to the pope’s remarks over the years — with frequent denunciations of populism and wall-building — but the paper argues in more details about how the style can exacerbate divisions and lead to other societal breakdowns.  “Things that until a few years ago could not be said by anyone without risking the loss of universal respect can now be said with impunity, and in the crudest of terms, even by some political figures,” Francis writes.  He adds that there are “huge economic interests” operating in the digital world, capable of manipulation and subverting “the democratic process.”  “The way many platforms work often ends up favoring encounters between persons who think alike, shielding them from debate,” Francis writes. “These closed circuits facilitate the spread of fake news and false information, fomenting prejudice and hate.”  Francis’s prescriptions range from the policy-based to the spiritual. He describes steps he says countries should take to more adeptly integrate migrants. He says businesses should direct themselves to eliminate poverty, “especially through the creation of diversified work opportunities.” He says people born into privilege must remember that others — the poor, the disabled — need a “proactive state” more than they do.  Other ideas are more fundamental, and deal with listening to the points of view of others.  “Other cultures are not ‘enemies’ from which we need to protect ourselves, but differing reflections of the inexhaustible richness of human life,” Francis writes.  He includes a critique of consumerism, “empty individualism,” and the free market. Even the right to private property, he says, should be secondary to the common good.  “This is a legacy document,” said Monsignor Kevin Irwin, a research professor at the Catholic University of America in Washington, who wrote an introduction to the English edition of the encyclical. “I think this pope is a big-picture guy and he wants to make sure that this is perceived to be the Catholic Church at its best, being welcoming and inviting.” The document is not just for Catholics, Francis says, but for all people of “good will.”  The pope’s previous encyclical, Laudato Si’, addressed responsibility for the environment, climate change and development. His first, Lumen fidei — The Light of Faith — released in 2013, months after he became pope, was written mostly by Benedict XVI, with only a few changes.  “[Fratelli Tutti] surely is the most political encyclical,” said Monsignor Domenico Pompili, the bishop of Rieti and head of the Italian bishops’ commission for culture and social communication. “One of its clearest critiques is against politics as a sort of marketing with shortsighted goals. It’s aiming to medium-to-long goals, politics as a vision.”  In the lead-up to Laudato Si’ in 2015, the church held a splashy multimedia rollout in a Vatican hall for journalists and other church officials. This time, the process was far more subdued. Francis traveled on Saturday to Assisi, the Italian hill town that is the birthplace of St. Francis, to sign the document at the saint’s tomb. Only a few dozen people were allowed to attend. The pope, who was not seen wearing a mask, traveled to Assisi by car. It was his first trip outside of Rome since the start of the pandemic.  Even before the coronavirus, Francis no longer attracted the fanfare seen in the early years of his papacy. Abuse scandals have bruised his reputation, and there is less novelty about his reform plans for the church. But the pandemic has added to the challenge, keeping the pope mostly confined inside the city-state, where in March he groused that he felt “caged.”  Francis’s year has had some indelible moments — especially a solitary ceremony he held in a rain-soaked St. Peter’s Square — but the virus has denied the pontiff many of his reliable paths for outreach. The Vatican has put on hold all of Francis’s overseas trips, and with it, the news conferences he typically holds aboard the papal plane. In 2019, Francis visited 11 countries and spent a month on the road, often in places on the Catholic periphery that he thought had been overlooked for too long.  “Removed from the people, he’s like a fish out of water,” said one Vatican official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share his frank comments on the pope. “Basically, Pope Francis is still in that cage to this day.”  Austen Ivereigh, a Francis biographer, said it’s clear the pope had planned to release this encyclical before the pandemic, and it is not his response to the year’s tumult.  “But one might say that the covid crisis has made his message more urgent and relevant,” Ivereigh said. He noted that Francis makes reference to the virus in several passages. “In journalism, we’d say it is pegged to the crisis rather than a response to it.”  Francis does not touch on any of Catholicism’s touchiest issues, such as roles for women and LGBT members inside the church, and though he talks generally about forms of abuse, he does not mention the sex crimes committed by Catholic clerics against minors. Thomas Reese, a Jesuit priest and senior analyst at the Religion News Service, wrote that the paper “is not a quick read that can be used for partisan bickering.”  Reese noted that many elements of the paper will be familiar to those who have followed Francis’s papacy closely, and the pope widely incorporates material from past speeches and homilies.  AD', \"Southern Tier sees Covid-19 spike — Mayoral contenders hold first forum — MTA faces 'suffocating' debt Presented by Uber  Reality check: Most of the concern about autumn’s increased coronavirus spread has been focused on denser communities downstate, where the virus erupted this spring and a new round of hotspots is now being targeted by health officials.  But in recent weeks the vast Southern Tier is emerging as a concern , particularly notable because it was largely spared from the worst of the outbreak seen this spring.  On Tuesday, the region, which spans much of New York's border with Pennsylvania, recorded an infection rate of just under 24 new cases per 100,000 people on a seven-day rolling average. For reference, that’s more than double the 10 per 100,000 cut off for states that New York officials consider dangerous enough to get on the tri-state travel quarantine list.  Aside from New York City and surrounding clusters, the Southern Tier is the only other region in the state to have a color-coded danger zone : Broome County was designated a yellow “precautionary zone” last week. The uptick is striking, because the Southern Tier was one of the first regions cleared to begin reopening businesses this spring. And with less trauma from the initial impact earlier this year, it’s more difficult to convince residents of the importance of enhanced precautions now necessary to control the spread.  Overall, New York’s tests still come back around a 1 percent positivity rate —- though that ticked up to 1.4 on Tuesday. And hospitalizations on Tuesday hit 923, the highest point since June 25, according to state data .  The governor has repeatedly said that the nation is only at “halftime” when it comes to battling Covid-19. Looks like New York could be heading out of the locker room soon.  IT’S WEDNESDAY.

WHAT CITY HALL'S READING  WITH NATIONAL FOCUS on the presidential election, the race to succeed Mayor Bill de Blasio kicked into high gear Tuesday night as seven candidates took questions on policing, real estate and economic recovery in the first public forum of the 2021 contest. The candidates, who span the ideological spectrum, found some common ground: They each vowed to replace de Blasio’s police chief, Dermot Shea, who caught flak for his handling of nightly police reform protests earlier this year, following the Minneapolis killing of George Floyd. They all promised to stay out of the City Council speaker’s race — a departure from de Blasio, who used his newfound influence in 2013 to position his favored legislator to win the powerful post, which is intended to serve as a check on mayors. And to varying degrees, they all questioned his expansive real estate agenda and unsuccessful plan for an Amazon headquarters in Queens, which would have created at least 25,000 jobs over a decade but triggered opposition in part for its reliance on large tax breaks and its end-run around a public review process. POLITICO’s Sally Goldenberg and Joe Anuta  “COVID-19 HAS put the MTA in such a dire financial hole that one in every four dollars the agency brings in next year will go to paying off its mountain of debt, says a report released Tuesday by state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli. Historically low use of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s trains, buses, bridges and tunnels has dug a $10.3 billion budget hole through the end of 2023 — and it’s not clear whether the agency will get relief from Congress to cover its losses. DiNapoli said the pandemic — which has so far killed at least 131 transit employees — is the greatest crisis in the MTA’s 55-year history. ‘The MTA desperately needs an influx of federal funds or unheard of service cuts and workforce reductions will happen,’ said DiNapoli. ‘Failure to fund the MTA now could disrupt maintenance and repairs and increase the MTA’s debt to suffocating levels that could take multiple generations to recover from.’” New York Daily News’ Clayton Guse  — While only 30 percent of riders have returned to the subway system as a whole since the onset of the pandemic in March, many subway stations in Brooklyn and Queens have recovered at least half of their usual ridership.  — “In May, as the city continued to fight to keep down its coronavirus infection rate, Mayor Bill de Blasio appointed transit experts to a Surface Transportation Advisory Council. ‘These councils will provide real world guidance to ensure our plans to reopen the city make sense and keep people safe,’ de Blasio said in a release. The transportation experts submitted a long list of ideas to the mayor this summer. Among the suggestions: aggressively expand street space for pedestrians and ramp up bike lane installation with the goal of doubling ridership; come up with a plan for restricting vehicular traffic in Manhattan like the city did after 9/11, ‘should traffic congestion surge’; and come up with a ‘robust communications plan’ to help New Yorkers get out of their cars and find other ways to get around. The de Blasio administration did not respond to the panel.” Gothamist’s Christopher Robbins  “HUNDREDS OF SCHOOL children appeared suddenly on the rainy streets of Borough Park on Tuesday morning. With backpacks in tow, they walked from stoops to yellow school buses, disembarking outside the propped open doors and back entrances of the neighborhood's yeshivas. They moved quickly, heeding the warnings they'd been given to arrive on time or be turned away. Facing an uptick in coronavirus test rates, Governor Andrew Cuomo mandated last week that roughly 300 public and private schools inside nine hotspot zones transition to all-remote learning. Newly-reopened public schools, some of which don't have any confirmed cases of the virus, reluctantly complied. But many private yeshivas are spurning the shutdown order in the ultra-Orthodox stronghold of Borough Park, home to one of the highest infection rates in the city, Gothamist has learned. According to one parent, nearly all of the private yeshivas in the neighborhood have ignored Cuomo's closing order.” Gothamist’s Jake Offenhartz and Scott Heins  NEW YORK CITY has begun to see a “leveling off” in coronavirus infection rates in some hotspot neighborhoods, following a weekend enforcement blitz that doled out $150,000 in fines to violators of new shutdown rules. Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday there are early indications that a new round of restrictions, which took effect last week in parts of Brooklyn and Queens, are having an effect. “We are seeing some results. We’ve got, certainly, a lot of work ahead. We are seeing some leveling off beginning in the communities that have been most affected,” de Blasio told reporters. Shutdowns took effect on Thursday under a decree from Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who said nonessential businesses must close, houses of worship can only host 10 people, and all gatherings are banned in red zones where the worst clusters of Covid-19 have occurred. Lesser restrictions apply in orange and yellow zones surrounding the worst outbreaks. POLITICO’s Erin Durkin  — There has been a surge in Covid-19 cases across multiple neighborhoods on Staten Island, with five zip codes seeing a test positivity rate more than 2 percent.  — It’s unclear whether early voting sites will be able to operate in neighborhoods with Covid-19-inspired restrictions.  “THE NYPD’s highest-ranking Hispanic officer, Chief of Patrol Fausto Pichardo, resigned from his position after weeks of tension with Mayor de Blasio, police sources said Tuesday. Pichardo, 43, was named Chief of Patrol less than a year ago, after serving as No. 2 for Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison when Harrison held that position. The NYPD confirmed that he put in his retirement papers, but sources tell the Daily News that City Hall officials are pleading with him to reconsider. The tipping point came after last week’s Orthodox Jewish protests in Borough Park, sources said. Pichardo worked 36 hours straight on Wednesday and Thursday, then went home to fall asleep and missed a call from the mayor, the sources said. When he woke up, he returned the call. But Hizzoner summoned him to City Hall Friday to give him a tongue lashing for not answering the phone, the sources said.” New York Daily News’ Thomas Tracy, Graham Rayman, Rocco Parascandola and John Annese  — The NYPD created a committee to “reimagine” its policing, in line with a mandate from Cuomo to police departments across the state.  — Elizabeth Glazer, director of the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice, is leaving her post by the end of the month.      WHAT ALBANY'S READING  “TRAVELERS from 38 states and territories will now have to isolate upon entering New York, New Jersey and Connecticut after the three neighboring states expanded their quarantine list again. Michigan, Virginia and Ohio were all added Tuesday to the tri-state travel advisory.” USA Today Network’s Jon Campbell  “GOV. ANDREW CUOMO’S new book was released Tuesday, and simultaneously serves as a definitive chronicle of decisions made by officials in New York to address the COVID-19 pandemic and a sharp rebuke to the federal government’s perceived failure to act. Cuomo’s noted, more than once, that the book is not a signal that the pandemic is over, but a retelling of the height of the crisis in New York, where the virus has killed more than 33,000. The book, titled ‘American Crisis,’ is Cuomo’s attempt to convince readers that New York formed a competent response to the pandemic, while characterizing President Donald Trump and his administration as careless and dismissive to the virus. ‘Trump did more to hurt us than to help us,’ Cuomo writes. ‘Anytime there was a function that needed to be performed by government, Trump instinctively withdrew.’” New York Now’s Dan Clark  “OVER THE PAST DECADE, more than 700 reviews of child deaths in New York were kept hidden by a state agency , decisions denying the public answers about whether Child Protective Services (CPS) workers failed those children. The most recent suppression stems from an unusually high-profile case: The January death of Thomas Valva, the autistic 8-year-old who had allegedly been beaten by his father, then forced to sleep in a freezing garage in Suffolk County, Long Island, where he froze to death. By law, after the death of a child in the CPS system, the state Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) must create a report examining whether CPS workers followed required protocols in investigating allegations of abuse that had been reported prior to the fatality. But OCFS has discretion about whether to release the resulting report, and often employs an exemption that blocks disclosure — a step the agency has taken in the Valva case. ‘I’m just flabbergasted that they would take a position like that,’ said attorney Jon Norinsberg, who is representing Thomas Valva’s mother in a negligence case against Suffolk County.” Times Union’s Chris Bragg  “BUFFALO POLICE have released body camera footage of New York State Supreme Court Justice Mark Grisanti shoving an officer after a fight with his neighbor, then invoking his friendship with the mayor and family ties to law enforcement, before successfully avoiding arrest. Police said Grisanti was drunk at the time. Law360 obtained the videos of the police detaining Grisanti and his wife late last week through a Freedom of Information Law request. The profanity-laced footage reveals in detail that the state senator-turned-judge used physical force against police and justified it, repeatedly threatened officers, and touted his political connections... In the video, Justice Grisanti is seen charging toward and shoving an officer trying to arrest his wife as the officer threw her down on their front lawn after she refused to stop screaming. The judge was restrained by a second officer but repeatedly demanded his wife's release, while listing his close connections to powerful people in Buffalo, notably his ‘good friend’ Mayor Byron Brown and ‘cousin’ Deputy Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia.” Law360’s Frank G.

Andrew Cuomo a victory in his long-running fight with the Trump administration over a prohibition on New Yorkers enrolling in expedited border crossing programs. The Department of Homeland Security imposed the prohibition in February, saying that New York’s new law allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses made it impossible to properly vet applicants to the programs. But DHS decided to end the ban in July when it was forced to admit that it had made false claims in court filings. Officials had justified their actions by saying that New York’s decision to block federal agencies from obtaining DMV records was unique; several other states actually impose similar rules. In the opinion released on Tuesday, Southern District of New York Judge Jesse Furman wrote that the federal decision was “unlawful” from the get-go and that it should be vacated to “ensure that it cannot be reinstated.” “The decision was plainly arbitrary and capricious,” he wrote. POLITICO’s Bill Mahoney  “THE SUPREME COURT has cleared the Trump administration to proceed with its plan to end enumeration for the decennial census early, blocking a lower court order that required the government to continue with the count as originally planned through the end of October. The high court’s order Tuesday granting the Justice Department’s request for an emergency stay offered no explanation for the decision, which required the support of at least five justices. Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a written dissent. After initially claiming it required an extension due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Trump administration switched gears this summer and said it would end enumeration a month early, by Sept. 30, so it could produce census data for apportionment of congressional districts for the next decade by the end of the year. Sotomayor, an appointee of President Barack Obama, was the only justice on the shorthanded, eight-member court to note her dissent. She called the harms from ending the count early ‘avoidable and intolerable.’” POLITICO’s Zach Montellaro and Josh Gerstein  ... 2020 VISION ...  “THE REPUBLICAN JEWISH Coalition is dropping a massive ad buy and launching an aggressive get-out-the-vote effort to assist Rep.

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday  (CNN) President Donald Trump has been intent on shifting the framing of the 2020 race from a referendum on his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed some 200,000 American lives, to an ideological choice.  If his goal during the first debate on Tuesday was to obscure his coronavirus record, Trump may have been successful, Eric Bradner and Kevin Liptak write . Despite Joe Biden\\'s attempts to inject it back into the discussion, the debate devolved into arguments and bickering that ultimately did not center on the global pandemic, which has now killed 1 million people.  But there were moments where Biden, who has a 47-year career in politics, cut through.  Speaking directly to families who now have an \"empty seat at the kitchen table,\" Biden slammed the President for having \"no plan\" to contain the virus, or limit its impact on the American economy. He added, \"You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap and your golf course and go in your Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives.\"  Instead of mounting a robust defense of his administration\\'s response to the crisis, Trump mocked Biden for wearing a mask, sought to claim that were Biden president, he would have done worse, and alleged that the former-VP wanted to shut down the economy. Check out our fact-check of those claims below.  FACT-CHECKING COVID-19 FALSEHOODS FROM THE DEBATE  Coronavirus and masks  In a heated exchange with Biden, Trump said that Dr. Anthony Fauci changed his mind about the impact of wearing masks.  Facts First: This needs context. Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, did change his mind about masks, but the need to wear one is not an ongoing debate, as Trump implied. Last week, This needs context. Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, did change his mind about masks, but the need to wear one is not an ongoing debate, as Trump implied. Last week, Fauci told CNN\\'s Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta that his evolving advice about masks is a \"classic example\" of how guidance can change as additional scientific evidence emerges. The pandemic, he said, is an \"evolving situation.\"  Fauci explained that in the spring, \"we were not aware that 40 to 45% of people were asymptomatic, nor were we aware that a substantial proportion of people who get infected get infected from people who are without symptoms. That makes it overwhelmingly important for everyone to wear a mask.\" -- Jen Christensen  Coronavirus and the economy  Trump claimed several times that Biden wants to shut down the country to address the coronavirus, while he wanted to keep it open.  Facts First: This is false. Biden said in an August interview with ABC that he would shut down the country if scientists told him it was necessary -- but he has not himself advocated a shutdown or introduced a shutdown plan. Additionally, he clarified his comments after the interview, saying in September, \"There is going to be no need, in my view, to be able to shut down the whole economy.\"  It\\'s also worth noting that presidents themselves cannot shut down the country. You can read a longer fact-check here . -- Tara Subramaniam  Coronavirus and travel restrictions  Trump referenced the travel restrictions his administration imposed on foreign nationals who had been in China, then attacked Biden for remarks he had made the same day: \"I closed it, and you said, \\'He\\'s xenophobic. He\\'s a racist and he\\'s xenophobic,\\' because you didn\\'t think I should have closed our country.\"  Facts First: This needs context. It\\'s not clear Biden even knew about Trump\\'s China travel restrictions when he called Trump xenophobic on the day the restrictions were unveiled; Biden has never explicitly linked his accusation of xenophobia to these travel restrictions.  The campaign says Biden\\'s January 31 accusations -- that Trump has a record of \"hysterical xenophobia\" and \"fear mongering\" -- were not about the travel restrictions, which Biden did not know about at the time of his speech. Biden never took an explicit position on the restrictions until his April declaration of support.

The Vesoul prosecutor’s office announced that the high school pupil had been taken into custody on Sunday after he wrote his support for the terror attack on the 20th of October, just days after the killing of Mr Paty.  According to a report from newspaper Le Figaro, the teen wrote: “Any disbeliever wishing to smear Islam deserves to suffer the same fate as Mr Paty. Allahu Akbar.”  France: Pupils Arrested After Praising Sharia and Threatening Teacher https://t.co/4judSbnDV2 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 23, 2020  Prosecutor of the Republic of Vesoul, Emmanuel Dupic, did not clarify which social media network the message was posted on, but commented: “The high school pupil admitted the facts.”  “We now know that any message posted on the internet can have consequences. So there needs to be a systematic crackdown on these kinds of messages,” he added.  The prosecutor also revealed: “It appears that this is a person who has converted and been radicalised, but who is not from a Muslim background.”  The father of a pupil in Mr Paty’s classed had called for a campaign against the teacher before his murder because he had shown cartoons of the Islamic prophet Mohammed to his class.  It was later revealed that the father, identified as Brahim Chnina, had been in direct contact via WhatsApp with the terrorist who killed Paty, 18-year-old Chechen refugee Abdulakh Anzorov.

Since the terror attack, President Emmanuel Macron’s government has vowed to close Islamist mosques and shut down Islamist groups and has arrested dozens for praising the terrorist attack.  One man, an inmate in a prison in Amiens, was sentenced to eight months after he had praised the murder to fellow inmates, saying: “It’s good for him, he (the terrorist) did the job well, don’t touch my religion, my prophet.”', \"Early voting in Texas has stirred hope among Democrats of gaining ground in the state that has been in the firm grip of Republicans for decades.  Data released Wednesday from the Cook Political Report, showed that Texas has shifted from “Leans Republican” to “Toss Up,” – figures that align with takeaways from the 2018 Senate race, in which Republican Sen. Ted Cruz narrowly defeated Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke at 51% to 48%.  The Texas Secretary of State's website Thursday shows that nearly 8.6 million Texans – more than have of the state’s registered voters – have already cast their ballot. That number represents roughly 95% of the entire vote in Texas in 2016.  The surge in voting is driven primarily by demographics like unmarried women and Latinos that tend to vote democratic and did not participate in the 2016 election.  Despite liberal enclaves like Dallas or San Antonio, Texas has for decades given the nation firmly conservative politicians like former President George W. Bush and U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry. But a surge of immigrants and younger voters participating in the election is shifting the pulse of the Lone Star State.  Still, others remain more cautious, given that Democratic voters are more likely to be wary of the coronavirus and vote early to avoid the crowds on Nov. 3.  TEXAS VOTERS WON'T BE REQUIRED TO WEAR MASKS AT POLLING LOCATIONS, APPEALS COURT RULES  “I think until we see what the actual Election Day numbers look like, it’s not clear whether or how much this is going to carry through,” Jim Henson, a University of Texas professor, told Bloomberg.

The attacks refocused the E.U.\\'s attention on religious extremism, which fell off the top of the political agenda after the 2017 defeat of Islamic State forces in the Middle East.  Under pressure to beef up security and reassure voters following the latest attacks, Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Europe\\'s troubled Schengen zone of control-free travel over open borders urgently needed fixing.  The attacks in Nice and Vienna involved assailants who moved freely between Schengen countries.  \"The threat of terrorism weighs on all of Europe. We must respond,\" Macron said after discussing the matter with Merkel, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and top officials in Brussels, the E.U. hub.  \"To reform Schengen is to allow free movement in security.\"  Armed police officers patrol the scene of a terror attack in Vienna, Austria, in November. Ronald Zak / AP file  Merkel sided with Macron in demanding stricter controls along the external frontier of the Schengen area, which brings together 26 countries, including most E.U. members as well as Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.  \"It is vitally necessary to know who comes in and who leaves the Schengen area,\" she said.  National security concerns, chaotic migration into the E.U. from the Middle East and Africa in recent years and most recently the coronavirus pandemic have led to the re-emergence of some border controls in the Schengen zone -- eroding what has been hailed as a milestone achievement in Europe\\'s post-World War Two integration.  Austria\\'s Kurz also called for a more coordinated plan for dealing with foreign militants while Dutch premier Rutte emphasized stopping \"undesirable\" foreign financing as a further avenue to tackle extremism.  Other ideas include imposing stricter demands on online platforms to combat extremism, setting up a special European institute to train Muslim imams, and being able to effectively deport people with no claim to asylum in Europe as well as criminals and suspected extremists.  E.U. justice and interior ministers meet on Friday — the fifth anniversary of coordinated attacks in Paris in which Islamist gunmen killed more than 130 people — to discuss a joint security response to the latest incidents.  Improving the sharing of security data and beefing up the bloc\\'s border force Frontex are also on the E.U.\\'s to-do list, according to their draft decision, which was seen by Reuters.  People light candles outside the Notre-Dame de l\\'Assomption Basilica in Nice in October, in tribute to the three victims of a knife attacker. Valery Hache / AFP - Getty Images  Crucially for Macron, the ministerial decision includes language reinforcing E.U. countries\\' rights to temporarily suspend free movement across Schengen borders during security alerts. France has had such curbs on free movement in place since 2015.  But many of the proposals now on the table have proven difficult to agree, let alone implement, suggesting the 27 national E.U. leaders will have a hard nut to crack when they are due to decide on concrete steps in December.  The discussion about harsher security measures comes as the bloc\\'s executive has been making efforts for a \"fresh start\" on another sensitive debate within the bloc — immigration.  Brussels proposed last summer to resolve years of rows over how to handle new arrivals by pushing for stricter border checks, tougher asylum scrutiny and effective returns of those not eligible -- but also a warmer welcome for refugees and legal labor immigrants to the ageing continent.  Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics  The 27 E.U. ministers are due to discuss those proposals on Friday. Commenting on the latest attacks, the E.U.\\'s top migration official, Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson, said on Tuesday the two debates should not be confused.  \"It is important that we are not afraid or migration, especially not of migrants,\" the Swede said in a speech.  \"We need to manage migration but migration by itself is not a security threat. There might be individuals who are dangerous — among migrants but also among people who already live here.  \"Migration as such is not dangerous,\" Johansson said.', 'But just days after the ad aired on YouTube and Twitter, the \\xadTanishq jewelry company pulled it from all social media platforms following a flood of angry calls from Hindu nationalists, including members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), to boycott the brand.  Kothapalli Geetha, a former BJP legislator, called the ad “highly objectionable” for “normalizing love jihad.” Love jihad is a conspiracy theory espoused by right-wing Hindu activists that Muslim men are engaged in a deliberate effort to convert Hindu women through marriage. A law enforcement probe in 2018 into 11 interfaith marriages found no evidence of coercion.  A prominent right-wing lawyer also shared the details of a Muslim employee of the company on Twitter, a move known as doxing, calling on his followers to “expose” Tanishq and make the company apologize.  The boycott call and the subsequent withdrawal of the ad is the latest instance of the bitter religious divide sweeping India under the Hindu nationalist government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He and his supporters envision India as a Hindu nation, not the secular republic enshrined in the Indian constitution.  Nearly 80 percent of the Indian population is Hindu, while Muslims make up 14 percent — which is still nearly 200 million people. After India gained independence from Britain and split into two countries with the birth of \\xadMuslim-majority Pakistan, India’s founders envisioned a secular republic in which all religions would have equal rights.  Relations between India’s Hindu majority and minority Muslims have come increasingly under strain since Modi assumed power in 2014. In August, Modi laid the foundation of a grand Hindu temple at a bitterly contested site where a 16th-century mosque was illegally razed by Hindu extremists. In February, Delhi was engulfed in the worst religious violence in decades, leaving dozens dead. Last year, Modi’s government passed a contentious law that makes religion a basis for citizenship — specifically excluding Muslim migrants — prompting fierce protests.  In a statement late Tuesday, Tanishq said it was withdrawing the ad in view of the “hurt sentiments” and “well-being” of employees and partners. The company said the idea behind its new collection — “Ekatvam,” or oneness — was to “celebrate the coming together of people from different walks of life” during “these challenging times.” The jewelry brand is a division of the Tata Group, one of the largest and oldest conglomerates in the country, with interests in energy, automobiles and consumer goods.  This isn’t the first time a brand in India has come under fire for promoting Hindu-Muslim harmony. Last year, an ad for a detergent showing a Hindu child protecting a Muslim child during the festival of colors elicited a boycott call, too.  Hard-liners feel that ads such as these promote a secular viewpoint, which they see as a threat to the essential Hindu identity of India.  Interfaith, and for that matter intercaste, marriages in India are frowned upon and often met with violence or stiff opposition.  Two of the country’s top advertising bodies condemned the threats against and targeting of Tanishq. In a statement, the Advertising Club said its review found that the ad is “not derogatory” toward any religion and does not hurt any national sentiment, while the Indian chapter of the International Advertising Association said the government should act against “intimidating behaviour.”  Karthik Srinivasan, a communications strategy consultant, said a shift from online trolling to off\\xadline threats appeared to have tipped Tanishq to withdraw the ad.  “I feel very sad that something that promotes unity is being withdrawn for the wrong reasons,” Srinivasan said.  “We’ve always had intolerance,” he added, but it has been “emboldened” as those in power look away.  Shashi Tharoor, a member of the opposition Congress party, shared the ad on Twitter, saying, “If Hindu-Muslim ‘ekatvam’ irks them so much, why don’t they boycott the longest surviving symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity in the world — India?”  Calling it “really sad,” one media executive asked why a brand as strong as Tanishq would “chicken out” in this manner.', \"The horrific news shook our souls though we were 7,000 miles and a world away. The hashtag #BringBackOurGirls flooded our timelines, garnering global attention and turning our eyes and hearts to the West African nation of Nigeria where 276 schoolgirls were kidnapped, 100 of them never to return. For many, it introduced us to Boko Haram and his ruthless reign of terror.  Fast forward to today. In America, we have been challenged on a multitude of fronts. We have witnessed a racial reckoning unlike any another in recent history as hundreds of thousands have protested in city streets against police brutality.  On June 6 alone, 500,000 Americans raised their collective voices in 550 cities across the nation. Racial unrest raged in Wisconsin after the shooting of Jacob Blake.  The signs carried by participants read “Black Lives Matter,” “No Justice No Peace” and “Stop the Violence.”  HERSCHEL WALKER REACTS TO NFL’S SOCIAL JUSTICE DEMONSTRATIONS  In the U.S. or Africa, violations of justice are a threat to us all.  While most of the world is focused on fighting the pandemic, we are largely unaware of the genocide that stills rages in Nigeria, right now. As we advocate for justice in America, we must not forget that this same clarion call for justice is desperately needed outside of America too.  Just more than 460 Nigerians have been killed during the months of July and August alone by radicalized Fulani militants. More than 50,000 people have been killed and 2 million people have been displaced since 2009 at the hands of Boko Haram’s armies and Fulani terrorists.  SOUTH AFRICA'S STRICT CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN CREDITED WITH SAVING LIVES, BUT ECONOMY IS SUFFERING  According to the Global Terrorism Index, Nigeria is currently the world’s third most dangerous country - after Afghanistan and Iraq - and the killing in this region is greater than that committed by ISIS in Iraq and Syria combined.  In June, the U.K. All-Party Parliamentary Group for International Freedom of Religion or Belief (APPG) released a report about the Fulani militia violence called, “Nigeria: Unfolding Genocide.” It claimed that, “…thousands of civilians are thought to have been killed [this year] in attacks led by Fulani herders and periodic retaliatory violence.”  Dr. Gregory Stanton of Genocide Watch recently said, “Boko Haram is committing genocide against Christians and crimes against humanity and against children, especially girls it kidnaps to become sex slaves. It forces boys to become child soldiers.” He continued, “Fulani Militants in central Nigeria are also committing crimes against humanity and genocidal massacres against Christians. What is mistakenly portrayed as a conflict between herders and farmers is actually a genocidal war…”  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  Though culture and continent separate us, our common humanity necessitates intentional involvement. Here are three ways America should help, right now:  The U.S. Government should appoint a Special Envoy to Nigeria and the Lake Chad region to engage with victim communities and relevant government administrations in order to help coordinate an international response to the crisis and the most effective strategy to work with our allies and the UN to stop this genocide. When the world ignores crimes against humanity, thousands of innocent people are slaughtered, as it did with Rwanda where 800,000 individuals died. While we are mired in a noisy election cycle here in the United States, our nation still has the capability to make appointments to decisively address such an atrocity even now. Secondly, the American faith community should stand with the Nigerian Christian community, as one unified body, by supporting ministries on the ground that are providing medical aid and humanitarian support to survivors, and essential care to the 3 million displaced refugees, rebuilding the 13,000 burned churches and schools and offering financial and spiritual support to the families of martyrs. The persecution of religious minorities throughout the world must be of utmost importance, especially to the Christian, as scripture admonishes us to remember those imprisoned and ill-treated for the faith as if we were suffering with them. And lastly, social justice activists in America, who are fighting for equality for Black descendants of the African diaspora, should also consider advocating for justice and peace across the Atlantic in the homeland, so that all humanity may know that this time of reckoning was limitless, combatting unfettered injustice and unfathomable violence in its myriad forms. Support a nonprofit that is serving Nigerian communities. Every little bit helps.  Although the megaphone of western media has been largely silent about Nigeria’s genocide this year, the slaughter has not relented and men, women and countless children under continual assault remain defenseless and in great peril. And tragically, with a death toll of nearly 1,500 in the first six months of 2020 there is no end in sight.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  According to the collaborative efforts of the International Committee On Nigeria (ICON), the intensity of the systematic killing, rape and torture of ethnic minorities and predominantly Christian communities in Nigeria is only projected to increase.  These lives cannot wait for another emotion-driven hashtag. Now is the time for action, America. Ignorance is no longer an excuse.\"]\n"
