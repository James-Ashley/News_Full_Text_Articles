      "[\"POLITICO Playbook: President Trump and Melania have Covid-19. What now? Presented by Facebook\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump will remain at home after being diagnosed with Covid-19. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images\\n\\nDRIVING THE DAY\\n\\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP -- who is tested for the coronavirus daily and has downplayed its risks, mocked the use of masks, proudly held large political rallies and suggested the nation should get back to its pre-virus business -- has tested positive for the deadly disease 32 DAYS before Election Day, pushing the nation’s political and governing apparatus into a historic state of flux.\\n\\nTRUMP, 74, tweeted at 12:54 a.m.: “Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!” This comes after senior White House aide HOPE HICKS tested positive.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT and first lady will “remain at home within the White House during their convalescence,” White House physician SEAN CONLEY said in a memo released by the White House at 1:05 a.m. The doc’s memo\\n\\nIT’S EXTRAORDINARILY EARLY, we don’t know much at the moment, and we all need to be vigilant about everything we say and suppose. But here are some early points to frame your thinking:\\n\\n1) EVERY MOVE MADE, every word uttered and tweet published by the White House will be under a microscope as the world tries to understand the health of the most powerful man in the world. We will be looking this morning for test results and assurance from VP MIKE PENCE and Speaker NANCY PELOSI.\\n\\n2) THE WHITE HOUSE does not have the public’s trust, and at a time like this, that’s important.\\n\\n3) THE PRESIDENT will be quarantined for some time, so the 2020 CAMPAIGN as we knew it will be effectively paused in its final stretch. How can they allow TRUMP in a room with the 77-year-old JOE BIDEN for another debate at this point? How can TRUMP hold another in-person rally? It seems extremely unlikely.\\n\\nTHE ENTIRETY of the president’s political message was that he handled the coronavirus pandemic well, the end was in sight, and people should think back to before the onset of the virus when they consider their vote. TRUMP’S diagnosis will make that quite tricky. NYT’s Jonathan Martin, Maggie Haberman and Matt Stevens on the political implications\\n\\n-- NYT’S MAGGIE HABERMAN and PETER BAKER say this: “If [Trump] becomes sick, it could raise questions about whether he should remain on the ballot at all.”\\n\\n4) ONE WOULD IMAGINE the administration and the Congress will do everything they can to preserve the health of the rest of the chain of command. That means that PENCE, PELOSI and Sen. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-Iowa) will likely have to take extra precautions. PELOSI is 80 and GRASSLEY is 87. They are No. 2 and No. 3 in the line of succession, after PENCE.\\n\\n5) BIDEN will certainly be tested. Political and financial markets will be incredibly interested in his results.\\n\\n6) THE PRESIDENT’S DIAGNOSIS should, theoretically, force Congress to rethink its testing regime. Reminder: Members of Congress are forced to travel to D.C. to vote, but they are not tested. THE HOUSE is going to leave after today. THE SENATE will be in next week -- as of now. There will be an effort to show government can still operate with the commander in chief sidelined.\\n\\nTRUMP’S ILLNESS could have long-term political and practical implications, but, as of now, it appears as if the government will continue to operate as normal in the short term. Federal agencies have been operating in a pandemic mode for months.\\n\\nTHERE HAVE BEEN MANY ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS swarming Capitol Hill. White House chief of staff MARK MEADOWS has been in contact with SCOTUS nominee AMY CONEY BARRETT, Senate Majority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL and a host of other key GOP senators. Treasury Secretary STEVEN MNUCHIN, who typically wears a mask, was at an in-person meeting with PELOSI on Wednesday.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA message from Facebook: Facebook supports updated internet regulations We support updated internet regulations to set clear rules for today’s toughest challenges and hold companies, including Facebook, accountable for:\\n\\n— Combating foreign election interference\\n\\n— Protecting people's privacy\\n\\n— Enabling safe and easy data portability between platforms\\n\\nRead more\\n\\nPELOSI is still scheduled to be on with STEPHANIE RUHLE on MSNBC at 9:20 this morning.\\n\\nA BIT OF THE BACK STORY … NYT’S MAGGIE HABERMAN and ANNIE KARNI: “It is not yet clear when and how Mr. Trump contracted the virus. The president and the first lady said they had both tested positive hours after one of his closest aides, Hope Hicks, also tested positive. Ms. Hicks received the diagnosis after she began experiencing symptoms on Wednesday while attending the president’s rally in Minnesota. Mr. Trump kept his appearance there to about 45 minutes, roughly half the length of one of his typical rally speeches.\\n\\n“Early Friday morning, it was still unclear how many other aides who had come into close contact with Mr. Trump had tested positive, but the White House said its medical unit was conducting contact tracing. Top advisers to the president described themselves as in a state of shock and said they expected a number of additional cases among people in Mr. Trump’s orbit. White House officials had hoped to keep the news about Ms. Hicks from becoming public, to no avail. …\\n\\n“On Tuesday Mr. Trump was accompanied by all of his adult children and senior members of his White House and campaign staff on Air Force One en route to Cleveland for the first presidential debate. None of them wore masks as they were seen boarding and deplaning. Bill Stepien, the president’s campaign manager, was seen on board without a mask and then was spotted getting into a staff van with Ms. Hicks.”\\n\\nWAPO’S JOSH DAWSEY and COLBY ITKOWITZ: “After White House officials learned of Hicks’s symptoms, Trump and his entourage flew Thursday to New Jersey, where he attended a fundraiser at his golf club in Bedminster and delivered a speech. Trump was in close contact with dozens of other people, including campaign supporters, at a roundtable event.”\\n\\nCREDIT WHERE DUE -- The news of Hicks’ positive diagnosis was first reported by Bloomberg’s JENNIFER JACOBS, not disclosed by the White House.\\n\\nMARKETWATCH … WSJ: “U.S. Stock Futures Drop After Trump Tests Positive for Covid-19,” by Chong Koh Ping\\n\\nTRUMP’S, UH, UPDATED FRIDAY SCHEDULE -- The president will host a phone call on Covid-19 support for vulnerable seniors at 12:15 p.m. in the White House.\\n\\nHOURS BEFORE THE POLITICAL UNIVERSE SHIFTED ON ITS AXIS -- “Biden flip-flops on door-knocking with just 33 days left,” by Alex Thompson and Holly Otterbein\\n\\nGood Friday morning.\\n\\nFOR THE RECORD -- 48 HOURS. That’s how long it took for TRUMP to condemn white supremacists after coming under fire for comments during the presidential debate. Last night on SEAN HANNITY’S Fox New show: “I condemn the KKK. I condemn all white supremacists. I condemn the Proud Boys. I don’t know much about the Proud Boys, almost nothing, but I condemn that,” Trump said in a phone interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. “But [Biden] should condemn also Antifa. Antifa is a horrible group of people.” More from Matthew Choi\\n\\n-- AP: “Trump debate comment pushing Black Americans, others to vote,” by Kat Stafford in Detroit, Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Ala., and Christine Fernando in East Greenwich, R.I.\\n\\nTHIS MAY BE MOOT, BUT … “As debate commission considers rule changes, Trump signals he’ll reject them,” by WaPo’s Annie Linskey, Josh Dawsey, Chelsea Janes and Bob Costa\\n\\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

Buoyed by polls showing him leading President Donald Trump, Biden’s campaign boosted its TV advertising budget to $4.1 million for this month, nearly quadruple what he spent last month and two-thirds of his total ad budget for the state. The day after the first debate with Trump in Cleveland, Biden made his first appearance in Ohio on Wednesday as the Democratic presidential nominee.\\n\\n“A confluence of forces has made Ohio competitive again in the eyes of Democrats. The economy and health care amid the pandemic are bad. Trump is bleeding white working-class and suburban voters in polls. Conservatives in the state are warring with Republican Gov. Mike DeWine for locking down the state during the pandemic. And DeWine’s Republican predecessor, John Kasich, is backing Biden. ‘We’re going to win Ohio,’ Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) declared in an interview. ‘Biden is the most pro-worker nominee of either party in a generation.’” POLITICO\\n\\n-- “Democrats Mount an All-Out Effort to Get Detroit to Vote,” by NYT’s Kathleen Gray in Detroit\\n\\n-- BURGESS EVERETT and JAMES ARKIN: “Liebermans haunt Democrats in key Senate races”\\n\\n-- TIM ALBERTA in Lake Orion, Mich.: “Has Elissa Slotkin Detected Early Hints of a Biden Blowout?”\\n\\nMORE GOP CRACKDOWN ON MAIL-IN VOTING -- “Abbott orders counties to close multiple ballot drop-off sites,” by the Austin American-Statesman’s Chuck Lindell and Nicole Cobler: “Gov. Greg Abbott ordered Texas counties Thursday to close multiple locations where voters can drop off completed mail-in ballots. As an election security measure, Abbott said, counties will be limited to one drop-off site where poll watchers — designated by political parties and candidates — must be allowed to observe ballot deliveries by voters.\\n\\n“The new order takes effect Friday, and it modified Abbott’s July 27 order that acknowledged the pandemic’s danger by adding six days of early voting and waiving a state law that limits mail-in ballot drop-off to Election Day only. Democrats blasted Thursday’s change as a thinly veiled effort to suppress votes in a tight election. ‘Republicans are on the verge of losing, so Gov.

That\\'s the problem.” Then the twist: “Coons ain\\'t that way. I remember when he started in politics, and I used to live on 9th and Franklin, and I\\'d see him.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMatthews took a handout and sounded open to supporting Scarane. The year\\'s final battle between the Democratic Party\\'s left and center is unfolding today in a state that has been hostile to the Trump-era GOP, emboldening activists who want “corporate” members of Congress replaced. It\\'s also a place where incumbents can shake every primary voter\\'s hand — and usually do, when the country isn\\'t in the grip of a pandemic.\\n\\n“In the middle of a campaign I literally meet thousands and thousands of people,” Coons said in an interview this weekend, after stopping by the city\\'s waterfront for an event recognizing Delaware\\'s Hispanic businesses. “On a typical Fourth of July, we\\'d go to five parades, where I\\'d shake thousands of hands. Epidemiologically, that\\'s a really bad idea right now.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nScarane, a digital strategist who\\'s raised more than $300,000, is trying to build on the left\\'s four-year project of changing the Democratic Party, in a place where the movement is playing catch-up. Two years ago, activist and veteran Kerri Evelyn Harris challenged Sen. Thomas R. Carper, who had been running successful races statewide since 1976. She got 35 percent of the vote after spending less than $200,000, revealing that there was a base for left-wing politics in a state politically dominated by moderate suburbanites.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“There\\'s people who may have voted in that race had Kerri gained traction earlier, which is one reason we started earlier,” said Scarane, who announced her bid last November. “There\\'s definitely been a shift in favor of things like Medicare-for-all and a Green New Deal among Democrats in this state.”\\n\\nThe nomination of Joe Biden, who endorsed Coons and appears on his literature, revealed the intraparty limits of that agenda. (“I like Coons the best,” Biden told reporters Monday after casting an early vote.) The left saw 2018 as a building year in Delaware, finding potential voters and linking together volunteers who could at the very least win lower-turnout elections down the ballot.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Coons-Scarane race has not attracted the same national investments as the Carper-Harris race, when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigned in Wilmington and Justice Democrats lent staff and money for the primary challenge. Both have ignored this race, viewing others as more winnable, with the New York-based Working Families Party providing the biggest out-of-state muscle for Scarane. But the campaign itself claims to have tapped 1,200 volunteers, knocked 40,000 doors and made 900,000 calls using the Democratic voter file, while WFP has run digital ads against Coons as part of down-ballot investments in Delaware.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Progressive donors, who used to support national Democrats but weren\\'t as active at the local level, have been activated,” said WFP\\'s Mid-Atlantic political director Vanessa Clifford, who co-managed the 2018 Harris campaign. “There weren\\'t many serious challengers before Kerri\\'s run two years ago.”\\n\\nScarane\\'s case against Coons is simple, even if it takes some explaining at the doors. Elected in 2010, Coons has voted reliably with Democrats on their major priorities but prioritized bipartisan work while rejecting the agenda associated with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Like other Justice Democrats, Scarane puts the blame on corporate PAC money — she refuses it — and argues that Coons would impede the party\\'s agenda if it took back power. Like Harris, she\\'s tried to make the race a referendum on the “Delaware Way,” in which business-friendly candidates trade their seats but never enact a liberal agenda.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“There are certain people who\\'ve bought into the line that bipartisanship is important, and we need a Congress that gets along,” Scarane said in an interview at her Wilmington home. “But there are other people who see the senator as quick to run to the other side instead of standing with us on the things Democrats should be fighting for.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCoons was not around for the votes that became vulnerabilities for Carper, like the 2002 authorization of war in Iraq. Scarane has focused instead on his support for Senate supermajority rules and questioned his commitment to supporting liberal judges. For evidence, she cites both his reluctance to end the filibuster and his 2013 vote against Debo Adegbile, an attorney nominated by President Barack Obama to help lead the civil rights division of the Justice Department.\\n\\nBoth questions, at the root, ask whether Coons would undermine a post-election liberal agenda. On the filibuster, Coons said he would see where events took the Senate, if Democrats took control and were trying to pass a Biden administration\\'s agenda. Step one was trying to form consensus, and step two was tbd.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“If Minority Leader McConnell — doesn\\'t that sound good? — uses the filibuster to block progress on any sort of legislative progress, then I\\'m not going to stand by and watch,” Coons said, citing immigration and gun safety as legislative priorities with Republican support. “I got to the Senate in 2011, and I\\'m not willing to see repeats of what he did to Obama, when we got nothing done for years.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Adegbile issue was trickier. When Democrats held the Senate, Coons joined every Republican and six other Democrats to block the Obama nominee. Adegbile had argued in a brief that Mumia Abu-Jamal, a death-row inmate convicted of killing a police officer, had been victimized by racially biased jury selection. The Fraternal Order of Police opposed Adegbile, and so did Coons. Reflecting on it now, Coons said, he should have worked harder to get to yes, but he said he was unable to square Adegbile\\'s record with his feelings over the killing of the officer.\\n\\n“In the run-up to the vote, I had asked Debo if he would call the widow of Dan Faulkner and express some regret about how the whole issue had ended up. And he would not. And I may have overreacted to that. I\\'ve had long conversations with the civil rights community here to say that I recognize that he would have been a great assistant attorney general for civil rights.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnlike Carper, Coons will end the primary without debating his opponent, depriving Scarane of the chance to confront him directly on his votes. But like many other incumbents facing challengers this year, Coons emphasized his liberal bona fides, pitching himself as a Biden ally who could get things done, and he\\'s kept nearly every elected official in the party on his side. Bryan Townsend, a liberal state senator who won his seat by ousting the more moderate Democratic incumbent, argued that Coons\\'s strong reputation with Republican senators positioned him perfectly to be a liberal dealmaker in a Biden-run Washington.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Whatever his portfolio positions are, they come along with a tremendously hard work ethic and an ability to articulate the issues in a way that appeals to a broad number of people,” Townsend said. “There\\'s a lot to be said for electing someone who is going to be able to hold the institution together from both sides, and make progress. I think in some ways he is taking undue heat for the idea that he isn\\'t ‘progressive’ on this or that issue or sufficiently progressive, because he\\'s focused on trying to figure out what can get done, as quickly as possible.”\\n\\nWhile broadcasting confidence about the race, Coons has spent $4 million on his campaign, most of it on resources that can be turned around for the seven-week general election but much of it to beat Scarane. Two years ago, the left badly underestimated what it would take to beat Carper, as a surge of suburban turnout overwhelmed Harris\\'s 29,406 votes — thousands more than her campaign thought she needed. More than 100,000 Delawareans had requested mail ballots by the end of Monday, and both Scarane and Coons were expecting high turnout.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThey were seeking their final votes in very different ways. On Saturday, Coons visited some outdoor parks where his campaign had rented space for socially distant canvassing and phone-banking. He marveled at Mack McKay, a 79-year-old supporter from his church, who had made tens of thousands of calls, and he gave one caller some advice for her voter conversations: She could mention that he was one of very few Democrats who supported a commission to study reparations.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Friday, Scarane and her supporters were at the doors, having conversations that ranged from polite to promising. Voters had nothing negative to say about Coons, and some had recollections about meeting him. Scarane kept the pitch to the agenda she\\'d take to Washington, always starting by saying the system was “working great for the very wealthy” and seeing where the voter took it.\\n\\n“It sounds like you\\'ve got some good ideas, and we need new blood in there,” said Randi Williams, a 59-year-old lab technician. With a Senate candidate on her doorstep, Williams turned to her chief electoral concern: How would Democrats defeat Donald Trump?\\n\\nReading list\\n\\n“Devastating wildfires out West inject climate change into the presidential campaign,” by Seung Min Kim and Brady Dennis\\n\\nAD\\n\\nClimate change and the 2020 race.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhy Republican legislators are resisting some changes that could get votes counted faster.\\n\\nDems in disarray.\\n\\n“Trump’s first indoor rally in months staged as a rebuke to coronavirus restrictions,” by Anne Gearan and Josh Dawsey\\n\\nThe meaning of a crowded room in Nevada.\\n\\nHow can a mighty field program work with voters stuck at home?\\n\\nIn the states\\n\\nThe very, very long primary season, which started in Texas six months ago, comes to an end today in Delaware.\\n\\nMostly.\\n\\nLet\\'s be sticklers. In Louisiana and Georgia, all-party primaries will be held Nov. 3 — for every major office in the former, and for the seat held by Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) in the latter. But today\\'s contests in Delaware close the chapter on partisan primaries, and when the votes are in, nearly every two-party matchup in 49 states will be set.\\n\\nMost attention will gravitate to the Coons-Scarane primary, by far the costliest race on the ballot. It\\'s not a rematch, as Coons has never faced a well-funded challenger and Scarane has never run for office before. But in some ways, it\\'s round two of the left\\'s Delaware project, an effort to create a beachhead in a place that has moved away from Republicans during Donald Trump\\'s presidency.\\n\\nThat project began in 2018 with Kerri Evelyn Harris\\'s campaign, and the vote patterns today will reveal whether the left can make more gains with suburbanites. Harris did best in vote-rich New Castle County, winning 37 percent of the vote there, and ran strongest near Newark, home to the University of Delaware. She did worst in the outlying suburbs that vote Republican in general elections and worse still in Delaware\\'s more rural counties, Kent and Sussex. Coons starts out as a heavy favorite in all three counties, and the high number of absentee ballot request and early votes — factors not there in 2018 — suggest a high-turnout election.\\n\\nAfter 2018, Delaware Republicans were locked out of power in the state, a punctuation mark on a long decline. They have not won the state\\'s sole seat in the House of Representatives since 2008, they have not won a Senate election since 1994, and they have been locked out of the governor\\'s office since 1988. The party\\'s recruitment this year doesn\\'t point to much optimism about reversing the decline, especially with a well-liked Joe Biden leading the Democratic ticket.\\n\\nStill, Republicans will field candidates for every major office on the ballot this year. The state GOP has endorsed attorney Julianne Murray for governor, but she\\'s facing five opponents, including state Sen. Colin Bonini, who ran and lost to Democratic Gov. John Carney by 19 points in 2016. Republicans have also endorsed veteran Jim DeMartino and actor Lee Murphy, respectively, to take on the winner of the Democrats\\' Senate primary and two-term Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester.\\n\\nPrimary upsets are possible in each race. DeMartino has been heavily outspent by Lauren Witzke, a pro-Trump activist who’s tweeted the slogan (“WWG1WGA”) of the QAnon conspiracy theory movement and has been adept at getting attention despite the steep odds against her. Though not endorsed by Trump, Witzke tweeted at the president and his son Donald Trump Jr. on Monday, claiming that a child had been egged “by hateful leftists” at one of her campaign events. The president’s son retweeted it.\\n\\nMurphy has raised less than $60,000 for his race, less than Witzke, but far more than his challenger, Matthew Morris. Still, Morris has gotten some attention by pitching himself as “the great American comeback story” — beating an opioid addiction to turn his life around.\\n\\nFurther down the ballot, the left is watching some local primaries closely, to see if they can repeat the breakthroughs they\\'ve been pulling off in other state races for city and legislative offices. The Working Families Party, which has endorsed Scarane, is backing two candidates for Wilmington\\'s city council, Colby Owens and Shané Darby. It\\'s also supporting four candidates in state legislative seats that are likely to go Democratic in November: Madinah Wilson-Anton, Larry Lambert, Marie Pinkney and Eric Morrison. If victorious, Pinkney could become the first Black gay woman in the state legislature; Sarah McBride, a transgender activist running for a safe state Senate seat in Wilmington, could become the state\\'s first trans legislator if she wins today\\'s primary.\\n\\nAd watch\\n\\nAmerican Chemistry Council, “Chris Coons.\" In Delaware, Jessica Scarane\\'s main argument against Sen. Christopher A. Coons is that he\\'s too beholden to campaign donors, especially corporate PACs. One of those business interests has been running ads to boost Coons, asking (as all such ads must ask, to conform to campaign law) voters to “call Chris Coons today and tell him thanks” for backing a stimulus and changes to the supply chain.\\n\\nDonald Trump, “Joe Biden Has Done Absolutely NOTHING for America in 47 Years!” The latest spot from the president\\'s campaign hands the microphone to a woman, never named, who says confidently that Joe Biden could “never handle the economy after covid.” Like many Trump ads, however, it focuses mostly on the economy before the pandemic, citing a headline about “women and minorities return[ing] to the workforce” that ran in The Washington Post 18 months ago.\\n\\nRestoration PAC, “Just Begun.” A super PAC funded almost entirely by Illinois megadonor Richard Uihlein, Restoration has run a string of ads in the Midwest supporting local Republican candidates and making very different arguments against Joe Biden. One ad, running 120 seconds long, reintroduced voters to the plagiarism controversy that sunk Biden\\'s 1988 presidential bid. This one only features Biden in a montage of Democrats who “hate” and “spied on” Trump to encourage the president\\'s base that nothing can stop him. “They hate him because he\\'s unraveling their schemes and draining the swamp, and they despise all those who support his efforts,” a narrator says.\\n\\nYou are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoll watch\\n\\nIf Joe Biden was president, would he have handled the summer\\'s unrest better or worse? (Monmouth, 867 adults)\\n\\nBetter: 45% Worse: 28% Same: 23%\\n\\nThe Trump campaign\\'s “law and order” focus and some decline in the number of coronavirus cases have succeeded in raising the salience of a topic Trump prefers. The problem, here and in other polls, is that it\\'s not a clear winner for the president; it\\'s just less rocky for him than the covid-19 response. By a 37-point margin, down from a 42-margin in June, voters say that Trump\\'s response to protests has made the national situation worse; by a 17-point margin, more voters think Biden would have done a better job handling the protests. Democrats live in fear of another protest developing into a violent riot, but nothing so far has advanced the Trump message that unrest now is a preview of “Joe Biden\\'s America.”\\n\\nWhich candidate has the sharpness and stamina to be president? (CNN/SSRS, 787 likely North Carolina voters)\\n\\nDonald Trump: 50% Joe Biden: 44%\\n\\nNew state polls have produced mostly good news for Biden; he\\'s ahead in every state carried by Hillary Clinton, and in every state Trump won last time by two points or less, the president is trailing. The green shoots are in CNN\\'s question about “sharpness,” a question that has been central to Trump\\'s campaigning even as the message of the week has changed. In both this poll and CNN\\'s poll of Wisconsin, Biden is leading overall and tied or better with Trump when asked who could best tackle crime. The only “issue” lead for the president comes when voters are asked about the candidate\\'s energy and mental strength. That could raise the salience of Biden\\'s Thursday town hall on the network and will definitely raise the stakes in the Sept. 29 debate: The perception of a slow and stumbling Biden is one thing keeping the president in the hunt.\\n\\nPresidential election in Florida (Monmouth, 428 registered voters)\\n\\nJoe Biden: 50% Donald Trump: 45%\\n\\nLast week\\'s Florida polling spurred a Democratic panic over the Latino vote, a source of strength for Hillary Clinton\\'s 2016 campaign that, per NBC/Marist, had moved back to the GOP. Biden\\'s campaign had not taken all the freelance advice offered by Latino strategists — Chuck Rocha, who helped Bernie Sanders win the Latino vote in the primaries, was among the critics — but it had been running Spanish-language ads for months, sparking fresh liberal worries that nothing was working for him. Monmouth\\'s poll finds a very different Florida electorate, almost identical to the 2016 exit polls, which had Clinton winning the state\\'s Latinos by 27 points. The Latino electorate has changed since then, with tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans settling in the state, and Democratic worries are less about converting conservative Cuban American voters than about preventing what happened in 2018: Republicans out-organizing them against the newest Latino voters, erasing Democratic gains elsewhere. Without a shift back, Biden’s resilience with older White voters gives him a lead.\\n\\nVoting wars\\n\\nThird-party candidates lost a string of legal challenges over the past week, encouraging Democrats who saw them as threats to winning some key states — something Republicans didn\\'t really dispute, as they helped the challengers.\\n\\nIn Wisconsin, the Green Party lost its ballot access, after the state Supreme Court affirmed that Greens botched their paperwork, failing to update the home address of vice-presidential nominee Angela Walker. That led to hundreds of petition signatures getting tossed, pushing the Greens off the state\\'s ballot for the first time in the national party\\'s history, but the court deemed it necessary to avoid complicating the sending of absentee ballots, which will begin this week. The Greens dawdled in filing their challenge, during which time county clerks began putting the ballots together.\\n\\n“Even if we would ultimately determine that the petitioners’ claims are meritorious, given their delay in asserting their rights, we would be unable to provide meaningful relief without completely upsetting the election,” wrote the court\\'s majority, with one conservative joining the court\\'s three liberals. “We agree with the [Election] Commission that requiring municipalities to print and send a second round of ballots to voters who already received, and potentially already returned, their first ballot would result in confusion and disarray and would undermine confidence in the general election results.”\\n\\nThe court may still hear a challenge from Kanye West, who was removed from the ballot after evidence showed that the Republican attorney who delivered his paperwork filed it after the deadline. But the rationale provided by the court yesterday suggests that West won\\'t get a pass: Adding his name would force hundreds of thousands of printed ballots to be destroyed or rely on voters who receive them to send them back unused.\\n\\nGreens have also been tossed from the Montana ballot, where Democrats saw their Senate candidate as a threat to Gov. Steve Bullock, and the Rhode Island ballot, where there\\'s little at stake but the party filed too few petition signatures. They are still on Pennsylvania\\'s ballot, but Democrats have appealed a lower court\\'s decision to the state Supreme Court, where their party has elected a majority of the justices. The situation there is the reverse of the story in Wisconsin: Democrats represent the last impediment to the state sending out its historic number of absentee ballots.\\n\\nThe Greens\\' presidential nominee, Howie Hawkins, has continued to campaign despite the ballot challenges. West, who has made only fitful campaign statements since declaring his bid 10 weeks ago, has said nothing about the lawsuits, delegating that work to attorneys. Unless he gets a respite from another court, the rapper will appear on just 12 ballots, three of them in states where he needed only to pay a fee for access. He\\'ll have been removed from nine state ballots that he applied for, with the reasons ranging from insufficient signatures to, in Arizona, his decision to register as a Republican in his adopted home state of Wyoming, voiding his attempt to appear on the ballot as an independent. Just two states where West made the ballot, Iowa and Minnesota, are being contested by both Trump and Biden.\\n\\nCandidate tracker\\n\\nOne of the last weeks before the presidential debates began with a fight over climate change, and continued today with something Democrats aren\\'t actually fighting at all: the Trump administration-brokered “Abraham Accords,” under which two Arab nations that were not at war with Israel formalized their peaceful relations.\\n\\n“We’re here this afternoon to change the course of history,” Donald Trump said at a White House signing ceremony Tuesday afternoon. “After decades of division and conflict, we mark the dawn of a new Middle East.” Joe Biden\\'s campaign has talked little about the accords since initially congratulating the administration for them; the Trump campaign has focused less on the specifics of the accords than on a Norwegian politician nominating the president for a Nobel Peace Prize.\\n\\nThe day before, Trump visited California for a roundtable on the state\\'s response to forest fires while Biden, in Delaware, delivered a speech warning that a second Trump term would lead to policies that make climate change worse. Democrats seized on an exchange between the president and Wade Crowfoot, California\\'s secretary for natural resources.\\n\\n“If we ignore that science and sort of put our head in the sand and think it’s all about vegetation management, we’re not going to succeed together protecting Californians,” Crowfoot said.\\n\\n“Okay,” Trump said. “It’ll start getting cooler. You just watch.”\\n\\n“I wish science agreed with you,” Crowfoot said.\\n\\n“Well, I don’t think science knows, actually,” Trump said. The next morning, in a long interview with “Fox and Friends,” the president suggested that the lack of forest fires in wetter climates, like Austria\\'s, suggested that climate change was not making fires any worse.\\n\\nKamala D. Harris returned to California on Tuesday to survey the damage; Mike Pence campaigned in Wisconsin on Monday.

That\\'s why we have a Supreme Court. It\\'s the only reason we have it. Supreme Court justices do not make laws because they\\'re not elected by voters. We don\\'t let them legislate as a result. That\\'s how democracy works: Only people who are elected get to make laws.\\n\\nDemocrats would like to change that system. They understand that Congress is an inherently small-c conservative body. Congress is never going to change the country overnight in some radical way because voters don\\'t want radical overnight change. They never do. So if you\\'re going to have a revolution, if you\\'re going to remake America, you\\'re going to have to do it from above. And you\\'re going to have to impose it on people. And the left would like the Supreme Court as their instrument to do that, a kind of super-Congress with lifetime tenure. Imagine power like that. There\\'s nothing you couldn\\'t do.\\n\\nSo once you understand that perspective, which is very much their perspective, Monday\\'s hearing made sense. Democrats spent hours talking about the 2009 ObamaCare law. That was baffling at first. If you\\'re interviewing someone for the Supreme Court, there\\'s only one relevant question about ObamaCare: Is it constitutional? That\\'s all they consider. That\\'s all they\\'re supposed to consider. Not how they feel about the law, not whether it comports with their personal values, not whether their party supports it. Is it constitutional?\\n\\nAnd yet that was one of the few things that Democrats didn\\'t ask because they\\'re not interested in whether or not it\\'s constitutional. What they care about is power and whether Amy Coney Barrett will diminish or enhance theirs.\\n\\nThey understand the Supreme Court purely in political terms. So, not surprisingly, they conducted today\\'s hearings like a campaign rally.\\n\\n\"Health care for millions of Americans is at stake,\" barked one finger-wagging senator from California, another Democrat, pointing to a photo of a middle-aged woman called Laura, who looked very unhappy without ObamaCare. The senator said Laura will be \"unable to afford the treatments necessary for her to survive.\"\\n\\nIn other words, if Amy Coney Barrett gets this job, it\\'s curtains for Laura. Democrat after Democrat made that very same point as they so often have recently: Obey us or many will die.\\n\\nEIGHT KEY MOMENTS OF AMY CONEY BARRETT\\'S FIRST DAY OF CONFIRMATION HEARINGS\\n\\nIt sounds like ObamaCare is going away if ACB gets on the court, but it\\'s not, actually, and that\\'s the amazing thing: Obamacare isn\\'t really at risk. There is no case currently pending anywhere in this country before any court in America that would eliminate ObamaCare. More importantly, we don\\'t have any idea how Amy Coney Barrett would rule in a case like that were it to materialize, which again, it hasn\\'t.\\n\\nBut most bewildering of all, Democrats themselves have spent most of the past two years publicly conceding that ObamaCare is a disaster. Six of the 10 Democrats currently sitting on the Senate Judiciary Committee co-sponsored Medicare-for-All legislation. That legislation would have completely abolished ObamaCare, along with all private health insurance. Kamala Harris is one of the people who voted for that. And yet there was Kamala Harris Monday warning us that the country will collapse if Amy Coney Barrett votes on a hypothetical case to destroy ObamaCare, which Harris herself voted to destroy.\\n\\nIt all seems kind of confusing, but it begins to make more sense when you realize the goal is not to preserve ObamaCare. Again, they voted to scrap ObamaCare. The goal is to undermine the legitimacy of our system and, in this case, of the Supreme Court so that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris can pack the court full of partisan Democrats who will rubber stamp their program.\\n\\nAgain, it\\'s about power. So that\\'s the key to the riddle when confirmation hearings become partisan political exercises. They make the Supreme Court itself seem like a partisan political exercise, and that degrades the public\\'s trust in the court and their support for our institutions. Democrats know that for the public to go along with court-packing, they have to delegitimize everything about the court and the confirmation process.\\n\\nANDY MCCARTHY: \\'NO ONE\\' THINKS SUPREME COURT WILL THROW OUT OBAMACARE IF BARRETT IS CONFIRMED\\n\\nAnd so that\\'s what they did again and again Monday. Never mind the fact that the Senate is by definition following every constitutional procedure in filling a Supreme Court vacancy. However, Amy Coney Barrett isn\\'t the outcome that Democrats want. Therefore, our system, they\\'re telling us, is illegitimate.\\n\\nThe irony, of course, is that it\\'s Donald Trump who\\'s undermining our democratic norms. Remember that? They tell you that at every turn. And yet it\\'s not Trump who tried to pack the Supreme Court. He could have tried when Republicans had control of Congress. He didn\\'t consider packing the Supreme Court. Now Democrats are planning to, and it\\'s a familiar path.\\n\\nHugo Chavez packed the Supreme Court of Venezuela in 2004. Erdogan did the same in Turkey. How did they do that? How they get their populations to go along with it? By claiming their judicial systems were already illegitimate. Sound familiar?\\n\\nOn Saturday, Joe Biden stumbled through the same rehearsed line you heard from Kamala Harris in the debate last week. Republicans have already packed the court, Joe Biden declared. Yes, we\\'ve had nine justices for more than 150 years. And yet somehow, without anyone noticing, Trump packs the Supreme Court.\\n\\nBIDEN SPOTLIGHTS OBAMACARE IN SUPREME BATTLE OVER BARRETT\\n\\nThey\\'re the ones violating the Constitution, says Joe Biden. So when I rewrite the Constitution, it\\'ll be fine. That\\'s the predicate. That\\'s the setup for what\\'s coming next. Joe Biden knows Republicans aren\\'t packing the court. He also knows he can repeat that lie with no consequences whatsoever because the media will never hold him to account. They want him to get away with it.\\n\\nBack in 2013, when it helped Barack Obama, a partisan operation called PolitiFact wrote, \"Court packing [sic] has involved one branch of government proposing to change the structure of the courts, either expanding or decreasing the number of justices.\"\\n\\nNow, Republicans are not doing that. It\\'s pretty simple. They\\'re not in favor of doing that. If they ever come out in favor of doing it, we will attack them for doing it because we\\'re not partisan. But of course, you won\\'t find a PolitiFact fact check of what Joe Biden just said on Saturday. Instead, our media actually rushed to perpetuate his lies.\\n\\nThis weekend, a piece by the Associated Press referred to court packing -- not sarcastically -- as \"depoliticizing the court.\" You increase the size of the court to dilute the other side\\'s power, you pack it full of partisans who do your bidding, and that\\'s depoliticizing.\\n\\nAP CALLED OUT FOR ADOPTING DEMOCRATS\\' LANGUAGE ON COURT-PACKING\\n\\nHere\\'s how the AP put it: \"Montana Senate candidate Steve Bullock said that if Coney Barrett was confirmed, he would be open to measures to depoliticize the court, including adding judges to the bench, a practice critics have dubbed packing the courts\"\\n\\nNo, not critics. Scholars, historians, politicians, Ruth Bader Ginsburg herself. Every person in America referred to court-packing as court-packing up until two weeks ago. It\\'s hard to believe that line made it into print, but it did. Court-packing is just depoliticizing the court now. You\\'ll probably see that definition formalized in the AP\\'s next woke style guide next to their entries on \"undocumented shoppers\" and \"peaceful riots.\"\\n\\nFundamentally, though, the AP is onto something, inadvertently. Many judges and justices in this country are obviously political. They have a lot of power, too much power, more power than any individual should have. Power in this country should reside with the electorate. People who are elected should have the most power, not people who are appointed. Unelected judges shouldn\\'t be deciding issues like abortion and immigration policy for the entire country, but they are.\\n\\nThe solution to that is not to embrace more politics in the judicial branch, though, it\\'s to recognize the proper role of the courts, to deescalate a little bit, to bring us a little closer to sanity.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nIn a brief moment toward the end of today\\'s hearing, in her opening statement, Amy Coney Barrett tried to do exactly that.\\n\\nBARRETT: Courts have a vital responsibility to the rule of law, which is critical to a free society. But courts are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life. The policy decisions and value judgments of government must be made by the political branches elected by and accountable to the people. The public should not expect courts to do so, and courts should not try.\\n\\nThese hearings will continue for the next couple of days and barring some really dramatic development, it does seem very likely that she\\'ll be confirmed in the end. So there\\'s not a lot of drama, at least as of tonight, surrounding her nomination. What happens to the Supreme Court itself, however, is very much in doubt.

She worried about the backlash, the impact it would have on her career, potential threats to her family.\\n\\nBut the former Department of Homeland Security official, who had resigned in April, reached a breaking point after President Donald Trump deployed Homeland Security agents to Portland, exacerbating tensions there. She decided it was worth the risk to speak out against Trump, whom she had come to view as a threat to the country.\\n\\n“Enough is enough,\" said Neumann, the former assistant secretary of counterterrorism and threat prevention. “People need to understand how dangerous a moment we are in.”\\n\\nThere are plenty of others weighing the same decision.\\n\\nWith just weeks left before the Nov. 3 election, now is the moment of truth for current and former Trump administration officials debating whether they, too, should step forward and join the chorus of Republican voices trying to persuade on-the-fence voters to help deny Trump a second term.\\n\\n“It’s now or never,\" said Miles Taylor, former chief of staff at DHS, who has been working to recruit others to join the effort. In interviews, Taylor has accused Trump of routinely asking aides to break the law, using his former agency for explicitly political purposes, and wanting to maim and shoot migrants trying to cross the southern border.\\n\\n“Those who witnessed the president’s unfitness for office up close have a moral obligation to share their assessment with the electorate,\" said Taylor, who launched the group REPAIR — The Republican Political Alliance for Integrity and Reform — to bring together concerned former officials.\\n\\nA related group, Republican Voters Against Trump, has compiled nearly 1,000 video testimonials from Republicans across the country who want Trump out. Strategic director Sarah Longwell said her goal was to provide a \"permission structure\" to help wavering Republicans feel comfortable opposing Trump.\\n\\nThe effort, she said, grew out of research on “soft” Trump voters.\\n\\n“While these voters disliked Trump intensely, they didn’t trust the media, they didn’t trust Democrats, they didn’t trust the leaks,” she said. “Who\\'s a credible messenger? It was people like them.”\\n\\nOther prominent “formers” have spoken out independently — or are considering it.\\n\\nFormer national security adviser John Bolton wrote a scathing book in which he said Trump “saw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed\" on how to run the government. Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis broke a self-imposed vow of silence in June with an op-ed slamming Trump\\'s response to racial justice protests. He and former director of national intelligence Dan Coats also were quoted extensively in a new book by journalist Bob Woodward calling Trump dangerous and unfit for office.\\n\\nBut Mattis and Coats, like former White House chief of staff John Kelly and former national security adviser H.R. McMaster, have refrained from more explicit condemnations, often citing a “duty of silence” or a long tradition of military officials staying out of politics, according to people who\\'ve spoken with them.\\n\\nEfforts to draw them out are ongoing. While former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen appears disinclined to step forward, there are hopes that former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson might be persuaded to comment and that Coats might be urged to say more. And Kelly, a retired four-star general, is said to be on the fence and torn about the decision.\\n\\n“I think that he loves his country and he wants to do what’s best for the country,” said Neumann, who served as Kelly’s deputy chief of staff at DHS and is hopeful he\\'ll speak out, even as others don\\'t think it will happen.\\n\\nOfficials like Kelly, with long careers and hefty pensions, would seem to have less to lose by doing so than more junior staffers like Olivia Troye, a former counterterrorism adviser to Vice President Mike Pence who last week joined the campaign against Trump and said she\\'d be voting for Biden.\\n\\nIn a video and interviews, Troye has accused Trump of mishandling the coronavirus and being more concerned about his reelection prospects than saving lives. The White House punched back with an aggressive attack campaign aimed at discrediting her through a barrage of statements, interviews and denunciations from the lectern in the White House briefing room.\\n\\n“These are not profiles in courage, but these are profiles in cowardice,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said of Troye and Taylor, dismissing them as part of a “fringe club of, quote, ‘Never Trumpers’ who are desperate for relevancy.\"\\n\\nTaylor said it was clear the White House was “coming after” those who speak out as a warning to others who are considering doing likewise.\\n\\n“The White House knows if they show this is a very costly thing to do they will scare people from going forward,\" he said.\\n\\nHe added that while more people are still considering coming forward, the White House tactics have worked to some extent — dissuading one senior official who had been on the cusp of speaking out.\\n\\nRick Wilson, a longtime Republican strategist who co-founded the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, stressed that time is running out.\\n\\n“There will be a cottage industry when Trump is out of office of people who say, ‘Oh, I fought from the inside, I fought the good fight, I kept so many bad things from happening.’\" he said. \"It doesn’t matter. There’s only one moment in time where it matters. And that’s now.\"\\n\\nFor Neumann, who describes herself as a conservative Christian and voted for Trump in 2016, the considerations were deeply personal, including what it might mean for her career in a city that puts a premium on loyalty.\\n\\n\"This is a town based on relationships,” she said. \"And what we have done is, you know, usually not done in this town. Usually you stab people in the back and do it quietly. You do it as an anonymous source. You don’t actually put your name to it.”\\n\\nNeumann is still out of work and notes that many companies fear making hires that might seem political. But she still said she\\'s been pleasantly surprised by the response overall.\\n\\n“It was more positive than I expected,\" she said, adding, “No serious threats, haven\\'t had to call the police or anything, so that’s good.”\\n\\nAnthony Scaramucci, who turned against the president last year after a short stint as White House communications director, has also been in discussions with those on the fence and is using every channel he can find to spread his message, including a new anti-Trump documentary.\\n\\n“We have to keep the pressure on, and so for me it’s a multimedia approach. It’s radio, it’s podcasts, it’s Twitter, it’s television and it\\'s movies,\" he said. “As a citizen, all I\\'ve tried to do is provide a surgeon general’s warning. ... This guy is a threat to the institutions of democracy, and I worked for him and I think it’s important to send a signal to other people,” he said, that it’s OK to speak out.', 'PARIS — Demonstrators in France on Sunday took part in gatherings in support of freedom of speech and in tribute to a history teacher who was beheaded near Paris after discussing caricatures of Islam’s Prophet Muhammad with his class.\\n\\nSamuel Paty was beheaded on Friday by an 18-year-old Moscow-born Chechen refugee who was shot dead by police.\\n\\nPolitical leaders, associations and unions demonstrated Sunday on the Place de la Republique in Paris holding placards reading “I am Samuel,” that echoed the “I am Charlie” rallying cry after the 2015 attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, which published caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad.\\n\\nDemonstrators also gathered in major cities including Lyon, Toulouse, Strasbourg, Nantes, Marseille, Lille and Bordeaux.\\n\\nFrench authorities, meanwhile, say they have detained an 11th person following the killing.\\n\\nAnti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said an investigation for murder with a suspected terrorist motive was opened.

In addition, Biden’s plan would free border-crossers into the interior of the country while they await immigration hearings, give taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal aliens, and restart welfare-dependent legal immigration.\\n\\nProviding taxpayer-funded healthcare to all illegal aliens would likely drive up costs for American taxpayers at an estimated $23 billion to $66 billion every year. Likewise, experts have said such a policy would spur a giant migration of foreign nationals with serious health problems to the U.S.\\n\\nMickey Kaus, a columnist and immigration reformer, said in a recent interview with the Center for Immigration Studies that it would be “very hard” for Biden and Democrats to walk away from providing free healthcare to illegal aliens after they have been promising such a measure.\\n\\n“It’s very treacherous for the Democrats, but I think they’re pretty much committed to doing it,” Kaus said.\\n\\nIn Pennsylvania, alone, Biden’s plan would provide free healthcare to at least 170,000 illegal aliens, funded by American taxpayers.\\n\\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The commission said the NBC employee selected the debate topics.\\n\\nThe picked moderators ignored immigration — and the linked issues of jobs, wages, innovation, income disparity, and national security — in the first presidential debate, the vice presidential debate, and one of two town halls.\\n\\nIn Trump’s October 15 town hall, he was asked about the fate of 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) illegal aliens who got work permits from President Barack Obama in 2012. But Trump was not asked about immigration’s impact on Americans’ jobs, wages, housing, and society.\\n\\nYet immigration is a central factor in all of the non-immigration issues selected for the upcoming debate, said Kevin Lynn, founder of U.S. Tech Workers. He recently helped U.S. workers in Tennesee defeat a corporate effort to outsource their jobs to the H-1B visa workers.\\n\\n“If you don’t know who is in your country and if you don’t have a culture where everyone is on the same sheet of music … How are you going to trace [contagious people] effectively with a population of illegals?” said Lynn.\\n\\nHe continued:\\n\\nWe know that we built the middle class at a time when we restricted immigration. We restricted it so that immigration policy worked well for Americans, and it worked well for the newcomers. What was going on before we began to restrict immigration in the 1920s? Well, the chambers of commerce would flood the labor market with willing and eager immigrants, only too happy to work for less. In America, when immigrants have arrived, regardless of race, they’ve moved up the economic and social ladder. One group has lagged, and that’s the American Descendants of Slaves (ADOS). The times when ADOS has done better in this country, when they’ve actually made significant advances up the economic and social ladder, were during restricted immigration from the mid-1920s to the mid-1960s. If we want to have a society that is equitable, the most practical solution to create a tight labor market, to make sure that people are not being displaced in the labor force. Eighty-eight percent of our population growth is directly attributable to immigrants and the children of immigrants. As we increase population, we increase the demand for things like housing and infrastructure, and we increase individual carbon footprints. We’re injecting [immigrant] people into a middle-class lifestyle in which just about everything is centered around the automobile. We have in America the second greatest individual carbon footprint of any country — short of the United Arab Emirates — so when you increase the population, you’re increasing our carbon footprint. When you look at U.S. graduates across the United States, they’re being displaced from tech jobs in our financial sector, our insurance sector, our healthcare industry. We have a huge contingent of foreign workers on employment visas working in our federal, state, and local governments. In many of our utilities, like Southern California Edison and Northeast Utilities, they’ve outsourced their technology and other support branches. If they’re not being worked here in the country by foreigners working for H-1B company, they’re being offshored to other countries. And if we think we had an issue when COVID struck in producing personal protective equipment because we had offshored all those manufacturing jobs, then imagine what’s going to happen when we no longer control financial, insurance, healthcare data at the federal level … Talk about national security problems! A real leader looks at the facts and makes the hard decisions. The easy decision is to say that anyone who wants to come to America can come. But 100 years ago, we realized that that did not work well for Americans, and leaders like [Presidents] FDR, Truman, and Eisenhow understood we had to restrict immigration for the benefit of both American and arrivals. We understood the impact that increasing numbers of immigrants have on the economic security of Americans, the national security of Americans, and the environmental impact. A real leader would restrict immigration because that is the best interest of Americans’ society.\\n\\nOpen-ended legal migration is praised by business and progressives partly because the arrival of migrants helps to transfer wealth from wage-earners to stockholders.\\n\\nMigration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.\\n\\nMigration also allows investors and CEOs to skimp on labor-saving technology, sideline U.S. minorities, ignore disabled people, exploit stoop labor in the fields, short-change labor in the cities, impose tight controls on American professionals, centralize technological innovation, and undermine labor rights.', 'Brexit Party Leader Nigel Farage was proven right in his prediction that hundreds of illegal boat migrants would make the journey across the English Channel from France on Tuesday, as massive numbers poured into the UK ahead of the changing weather.\\n\\nAt least 300 illegal boat migrants were recorded to have reached the UK on Tuesday, travelling in small rubber boats from France.\\n\\nA local source told The Telegraph: “It is an absolute deluge today.

Barr, applying an originalist approach that looked to the 18th-century intentions. \"But that power extends only to people who are dangerous. Founding legislatures did not strip felons of the right to bear arms simply because of their status as felons.\"\\n\\nBarrett concluded, \"Holding that the ban is constitutional ... does not put the government through its paces, but instead treats the Second Amendment as a second-class right.\"\\n\\nPublic charge\\n\\nIn June, Barrett dissented as a 7th Circuit panel left intact a US district court decision temporarily blocking a Trump policy that disadvantaged green card applicants who apply for any public assistance. In dispute were federal immigration regulations regarding when an applicant would be deemed a \"public charge\" and ineligible for permanent status in the US.\\n\\nIn her dissent, Barrett wrote that the Trump administration\\'s interpretation of the relevant \"public charge\" law was not \"unreasonable.\"\\n\\n\"At bottom, the plaintiffs\\' objections reflect disagreement with this policy choice and even the statutory exclusion itself. Litigation is not the vehicle for resolving policy disputes. Because I think that DHS\\'s definition is a reasonable interpretation of the statutory term \\'public charge,\\' I respectfully dissent,\" she wrote.\\n\\nThe 7th Circuit majority in Cook County v. Wolf countered that Barrett\\'s construction failed to take account of the immigrants who would \"bear the brunt of the\" new rule.\\n\\nAbortion\\n\\nIn 2018, when the full 7th Circuit declined to reconsider a dispute over an Indiana abortion regulation requiring that the post-abortion fetal remains be cremated or buried, Barrett dissented with fellow conservatives. They began by focusing on a more contentious provision that had been earlier invalidated and not subject to the appeal.\\n\\nThat provision made it unlawful for physicians to perform an abortion because of the race, sex or disability of the fetus. Barrett joined a dissent written by Judge Frank Easterbrook referring to the law as a \"eugenics statute.\"\\n\\n\"None of the Court\\'s abortion decisions holds that states are powerless to prevent abortions designed to choose the sex, race, and other attributes of children,\" the dissent added.\\n\\nAffordable Care Act\\n\\nIn an early 2017 law review essay , reviewing a book related to the Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act, Barrett criticized Chief Justice John Roberts\\' rationale that saved the law in 2012.\\n\\n\"Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute,\" Barrett wrote. \"He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power.\"\\n\\nAt another point, Barrett refers to \"Roberts\\' devotion to constitutional avoidance.\"\\n\\nThe court is scheduled to take up the latest challenge to Obamacare on November 10.\\n\\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.', 'Although he lost his reelection bid, President Trump saw his support among Hispanic voters grow by about four points nationally over his 2016 performance, winning the backing of about a third of these voters, according to exit polls. Plenty of evidence points to the extreme position on abortion embraced by Democrats as a primary cause of the shift.\\n\\nAs “pro-life for the whole life” Democrats, we worry that this shift could intensify in future elections, especially for Republican candidates with positions on immigration more moderate than Trump’s.\\n\\nAbundant polling confirms the importance of abortion to Hispanic voters — especially Hispanic Catholics.\\n\\nLOUISIANA VOTERS APPROVE AMENDMENT STATING ABORTION IS NOT A RIGHT IN STATE CONSTITUTION\\n\\nIn the election just concluded, Trump made the strongest gains among Hispanic communities dominated by recent immigrants and religious voters. At a localized level, Biden suffered stunning drops in Hispanic support across the nation compared to vote totals Hillary Clinton received four years ago: 9 points in El Paso County in Texas, 19 points in Texas’ Cameron County, 23 points in Texas’ Hidalgo County, and 23 points in the overwhelmingly Hispanic Miami-Dade County in Florida.\\n\\nIn Starr County in Texas there was a remarkable 55-point swing from Clinton in 2016 to Trump in 2020.\\n\\nBordering Mexico, Starr County is 96% Hispanic, dominated by Mexican Americans, as well as 75% Catholic. Starr County’s Republican Party chair attributed the dramatic swing in the small rural county at least in part to the fact that the county is “very pro-life.”\\n\\nIf Starr County’s Hispanic Catholics are anything like those nationwide, almost one in three say they will only vote for a candidate who shares their pro-life views.\\n\\nThe simplest explanation for Clinton voters becoming Trump voters this year? Democrats brought the most extreme abortion platform in history to America’s most pro-life demographic group.\\n\\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris of California — now president-elect and vice president-elect — have promised taxpayer-funded abortion on demand. The official Democratic Party platform, moreover, makes zero mention of any restrictions or regulations on abortions.\\n\\nHispanic Americans are overwhelmingly pro-life. They are the only ethnicity that believes abortion should be mostly or always illegal, as well as the only ethnicity to have become more pro-life in the past five years.\\n\\nPresident Trump knows this, which is why he campaigned aggressively on a pro-life message among Latino voters.\\n\\nFrom his launch of Evangelicals for Trump at a Miami megachurch to a rally targeted at Hispanic voters two days before the election, the message of abortion was front and center for the president.\\n\\nPolling shows the effectiveness of pro-life messaging with Hispanic voters. In 2014, the Texas Gubernatorial Project found that just one pro-life video advertisement could shift Hispanic voters 13 points away from a pro-choice Democrat to a pro-life Republican.\\n\\nOf course, it’s difficult to generalize about a population as diverse as Hispanic Americans. Undoubtedly, the GOP’s message of the “socialist” threat posed by the Biden-Harris campaign resonated with Cuban Americans. At the same time, that explanation can’t account for the even wilder swing seen among Mexican Americans in Texas.\\n\\nThe most straightforward explanation is that values matter. Hispanic voters aren’t blind to the abortion extremism in the Democratic Party platform. The huge gap between their values and those represented in the Democratic platform matter.\\n\\nWe’re delighted that President-elect Biden will usher in a return to humane immigration policies, action on climate change, and will work to heal systemic racism.\\n\\nBut we worry about the future of the Democratic Party. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., was right when she said that “when it comes to Latinos the party’s just never seriously made an effort.”\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\\n\\nThe Democratic Party and Planned Parenthood have been pitching losing rhetoric — not actual policies — to Hispanic voters for years.\\n\\nThis rhetoric is disturbing: it holds that it’s not enough that Latinas are twice as likely to have an abortion as White women.

And when it does listen, it might not like what these voters have to say.\\n\\nXavier Bisits is national operations director of Democrats for Life.', 'Seventeen years after it was born with the help of the CIA seed money, data-mining outfit Palantir Technologies is finally going public in the biggest Wall Street tech offering since last year’s debut of Slack and Uber.\\n\\nNever profitable and dogged by ethical objections for assisting in the Trump administration’s deportation crackdown, Palantir has forged ahead with a direct listing of its stock, which is set to begin trading on Wednesday. In its stock offering, the company is not selling newly minted shares to raise money; it is simply listing existing shares for public trading.\\n\\nThe low-key strategy may not generate the enthusiasm many technology offerings do. But it is in character for a secretive company long reliant on spies, police and the military as customers – and whose founders are holding onto voting control of the company.\\n\\nThe big question for both investors and company management: Can Palantir successfully transition from a business built on the costly handholding of government customers to serving corporate customers at scale? The company is a hybrid provider of software and consulting services that often embeds its own engineers with clients.\\n\\nAnalysts say its future depends on selling multinationals its tools for gathering disparate data from an ever-expanding data universe and using artificial intelligence technology to find previously undetectable patterns. Those can theoretically guide strategic decisions and identify new markets much as they have aided in tracking rebel fighters and sorting military intelligence.\\n\\nThe company sets itself apart from most US technology providers, and just moved its headquarters to Denver from Silicon Valley. Palantir colours itself patriotic and belittles other tech firms that would not unquestionably support US dominance in war-fighting and intelligence.\\n\\n“Our software is used to target terrorists and to keep soldiers safe,” CEO Alex Karp wrote in a letter accompanying Palantir’s offering prospectus. While Karp acknowledged the ethical challenge of building software that “enables more effective surveillance by the state”, Palantir’s prospectus touts its work helping US soldiers counter roadside bombings and fight the ISIL (ISIS) group.\\n\\nBut investors also have to reckon with the Peter Thiel factor.\\n\\nThe iconoclastic entrepreneur and PayPal co-founder endorsed President Donald Trump in 2016, worked on his transition team and holds the largest chunk of Palantir stock. Thiel already exerts tremendous power from the board of Facebook, which dominates global media and seeks to create a digital currency.\\n\\nIn its IPO prospectus, Palantir paints a dark picture of faltering government agencies and institutions in danger of collapse and ripe for rescue by a “central operating system” forged under Thiel’s auspices. As the offering is structured, Thiel will be the dominant voice among the Palantir co-founders who will retain voting control.\\n\\n“Is that someone who you want deciding how a component of the [national] security apparatus is designed?” asked New York University business professor Scott Galloway. “If you believe that power corrupts and checks and balances are a good idea, this is just from the get-go a really bad idea.”\\n\\nEarlier in September, BuzzFeed reported that Thiel hosted a known white nationalist, Kevin DeAnna, at a 2016 dinner party, citing emails it obtained and published whose authors refused to talk to the online news outlet. Thiel declined through a spokesman to discuss the report with The Associated Press news agency. Critics say he shares the blame for Facebook’s incomplete removal of toxic disinformation disseminated by the pro-Trump far-right fringe.\\n\\nThen there are Palantir’s fundamentals, which Galloway considers lousy. The company has just 125 customers in 150 countries, including Airbus, Merck, Credit Suisse and the Danish National Police. Slightly less than half its 2019 revenues were from government agencies, and three clients – which Palantir did not name – accounted for almost a third of revenues.\\n\\n“They’re massively unprofitable and they’ve never been able to figure it out,” Galloway said, noting that it took Google three years to earn a profit, and Amazon seven. Over a much longer span, Palantir has accumulated $3.8bn in losses, raised about $3bn and listed $200m in outstanding debt as of July 31.\\n\\nAs the Palantir offering is structured, Peter Thiel will be the dominant voice among the Palantir co-founders who will retain voting control [File: Ben Margot/AP Photo] Palantir, named for the mystical all-seeing stones from Tolkien’s “Lord of The Rings”, has recently been deepening its relationship with Uncle Sam, including winning a modest contract early in the COVID-19 pandemic for helping the White House gather data on the coronavirus’s impact.\\n\\nSenior emerging technology analyst Brendan Burke of Pitchbook says he is not worried that Thiel’s association with Trump will hurt the company if Trump loses the election.\\n\\n“The political connections don’t appear to be the main driver of their recent substantial contract wins,” he said, although he noted that government contracts can be more volatile than corporate ones, where Palantir’s foothold is less firm.\\n\\nPalantir offers two software platforms. Foundry is designed to link disparate and largely incompatible data sources into a central operating system. It is the company’s primary hope for broadening its business.\\n\\nAn earlier product, Gotham, has been used by defence and intelligence analysts and police departments to identify patterns deep within datasets. But the value of “predictive policing” tools developed with the platform have been questioned for their potential to unfairly target people of colour. The New Orleans and New York City police departments, once customers, have used it.\\n\\nA 2017 research paper by University of Texas sociologist Sarah Brayne, who studied the Los Angeles Police Department’s use of Gotham, found the software could lead to a proliferation of unregulated personal data collected by police from commercial and law enforcement databases.\\n\\nOn Monday, Amnesty International issued a briefing that says Palantir is failing to conduct human rights due diligence around its contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, calling it “deeply ironic” that the company crows about its determination not to work with regimes like China that abuse human rights.\\n\\nPalantir’s ICE contracts involve the maintenance and improvement of two products used in deportation raids. One of them, its web-based Falcon tool, has enhanced data accessible to investigators “involving the illegal movement of people into, within, and out of the United States”, according to documents obtained by the AP, including court records, and by the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center in a freedom-of-information request.\\n\\nPalantir has acknowledged in its SEC filing that “unfavorable coverage in the media” and from social activists could hurt its business. It also says its contractual obligations might prevent it from being able to defend its actions publicly, although it recently named a former Wall Street Journal reporter to its board.\\n\\nNegative publicity over ICE contracts may also have hurt company recruitment on college campuses.', 'Populist Italian Senator Matteo Salvini was the victim of a physical attack, reportedly by a politically left-wing migrant during a campaign event ahead of the regional elections in the traditional leftist stronghold of Tuscany.\\n\\nThe attack took place in the commune of Pontassieve on Wednesday, with the woman tearing at the League leader’s shirt and his rosary.\\n\\nGuglielmo Picchi, former deputy minister of foreign affairs, labelled the attacker as an Antifa militant.

This means that the electorate is slowly “depolarizing on race … polarizing around education rather than income,” he wrote.\\n\\n“Trump’s position has improved relative to 2016 with a number of non-White groups, including Black women, Hispanic men, and two non-White religious groups,” the Washington Post reported on October 9. “This has been a concerted focus of Trump’s, with constant appeals to both groups. He’s made headway, which could help in a close election, either by dampening turnout for Biden or reducing Biden’s margins with the groups.”\\n\\nThe reports skirted around the possible reasons for Trump’s rising support among minorities. Notably, the articles did not mention Trump’s curbs on blue-collar illegal migration, which pressure employers to hire young Americans — of all colors — at higher wages.\\n\\nBut the gain among minorities seems to match the immigration policy change. For example, the shift towards Trump is occurring among younger male voters, says fivethirtyeight.com:\\n\\nTrump’s support among young Black voters (18 to 44) has jumped from around 10 percent in 2016 to 21 percent in UCLA Nationscape’s polling. … For instance, an early-July African American Research Collaborative poll of battleground states found that 35 percent of 18-to-29-year-old Black adults agreed that although they didn’t always like Trump’s policies, they liked his strong demeanor and defiance of the establishment. Conversely, just 10 percent of those 60 and older said the same. It’s a similar story with younger Hispanic Americans, a group where Trump has also made gains. According to UCLA Nationscape’s polling, Trump is attracting 35 percent of Hispanic voters under age 45, up from the 22 percent who backed him four years ago in the CCES data.\\n\\nMany polls show that the public welcomes legal migrants — but also much prefers that new jobs go to Americans first. In April 2020, a Washington Post poll showed that 69 percent of Hispanics said yes when they were asked, “Would you support … temporarily blocking nearly all immigration into the United States during the coronavirus outbreak?” Just 30 percent of Hispanics oppose the border shutdown.\\n\\nJoe Biden’s 2020 plan promises to let companies import more visa workers, to let mayors import temporary workers, to accelerate the inflow of chain-migration migrants, to end migration enforcement against illegal aliens unless they commit a felony, and to dramatically accelerate the inflow of poor refugees to at least 125,000 per year.\\n\\nIn contrast, Trump’s 2020 plan offers broadly popular — but quite limited — pro-American restrictions on migration and visa workers.\\n\\nOpen-ended legal migration is praised by business and progressives partly because the arrival of migrants helps to transfer wealth from wage-earners to stockholders.\\n\\nMigration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.\\n\\nMigration allows investors and CEOs to skimp on labor-saving technology, sideline U.S. minorities, disregard workplace discrimination rules, ignore disabled people, exploit stoop labor in the fields, short-change labor in the cities, impose tight control on American professionals, centralize technological innovation, and undermine many types of labor rights.', 'Homeless Bulgarian migrant Blagovest Hadjigueorguiev admitted setting fire to a police officer last month who tried to evict him from land belonging to Prince Charles.\\n\\nAppearing before Truro Crown Court on Tuesday, the 30-year-old admitted to committing an act of grievous bodily harm with intent against PC Darral Mares and attempted grievous bodily harm with intent towards PC Alen Lenton.\\n\\nOn September 11th, police officers responded to a call for help from bailiffs struggling to evict the Bulgarian who had been staying illegally on property belonging to the Duchy of Cornwall in Newquay.

Registration is an important first step, particularly this year.\\n\\nVoter participation countrywide has been abysmal in recent elections. According to the Pew Research Center, America ranked 26th of 32 developed nations for the percentage of eligible voters who took part in the last presidential election. By Pew's count, 55.7% of the U.S. voting age population cast a vote in 2016.\\n\\nAmerica, we can and should do better.\\n\\nI spent much of the weekend thinking about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died Friday at the age of 87 after a two-decade battle with cancer. She was a champion for voting rights, and she wrote a powerful dissent in 2013 when the court struck down a crucial section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by a 5-4 vote. The ruling enabled states with a history of voter discrimination to escape Justice Department oversight.\\n\\n“It is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm,” Ginsburg wrote, “because you are not getting wet.”\\n\\nAmericans are throwing away their right to vote, even as the country drowns in political polarization. The fight over her Supreme Court seat notwithstanding, if there is one way to honor Ginsburg — a woman who stood tall for Americans' freedoms even as she experienced significant personal health crises — it is simply to vote.\\n\\nAfter all, this Election Day will be framed in the history of a global pandemic. And there have been significant challenges to voting because of COVID-19. New voter registrations have dropped dramatically in the United States as stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements shuttered places where advocates engage with voters.\\n\\nAmericans missed so many opportunities for the contact-based registration drives we are used to seeing at concerts, state fairs, sporting events, art festivals and other public venues. Another avenue disappeared for months when departments of motor vehicles closed, thwarting those who would have been prompted to register to vote while registering a vehicle or renewing a driver’s license.\\n\\nBut not all is lost. Social media has proved to serve as a strong arm in voter engagement, particularly reaching those under 30. Last week, Snapchat reported that more than 400,000 people had used the platform to register to vote. And Foot Locker has partnered with Rock the Vote in transforming more than 2,000 retail locations into voting registration sites in an effort to encourage turnout among the more than 4 million young people eligible to cast ballots for the first time. You might chuckle at the idea, but I believe it's crucial to reach would-be voters where they are — including our filter-loving or sneaker-loving youth.\\n\\nBecause this is an election year like no other. For the past six months, it has been difficult to focus on little more than the novel coronavirus and the civil unrest in many American cities. But we can't afford to lose sight of the many other pressing issues and policies we must reckon with as a country: immigration, climate change, systemic racism, income inequality and health care. With each, we must ask ourselves who we believe is best suited to serve as commander in chief for the next four years.\\n\\nUltimately, you must decide which candidate best aligns with your values and political ideology. But regardless of your politics, it’s important to participate in America’s electoral process. That can only happen if you register and vote.\\n\\nNational columnist Suzette Hackney is a member of USA TODAY’S Editorial Board.

Those shelters offer legal services as required under a longstanding court settlement known as the Flores agreement.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday.\\n\\nJustice Department lawyer Scott Stewart argued that the Flores agreement doesn\\'t apply to children detained in hotels before expulsion.\\n\\n\"Sometimes, you know, letting people have lawyers even if you\\'re not obliged to might be a good idea,\" said Judge William A. Fletcher, an appointee of President Clinton. Fletcher added it was \"an argument you may be about to lose as to whether or not the Flores agreement applies.\"\\n\\nStewart said the government\\'s policy of expelling unaccompanied children was part of a \"comprehensive, systematic approach\" to fight the coronavirus.\\n\\n\"The idea is turn away as quickly as possible, at the border, potential vectors of infection,\" he said, adding that a variety of factors led to some children being detained for weeks.\\n\\nU.S. District Judge Dolly Gee\\'s Sept. 4 order said hotel detention violated \"fundamental humanitarian protections\" and said the Trump administration had not demonstrated that using hotels would prevent the spread of COVID-19.\\n\\nUnder the Flores agreement and federal anti-trafficking law, most unaccompanied immigrant children who cross the border, with or without authorization, are supposed to be transferred to government shelters.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has set aside that practice during the pandemic. Instead, it has hired contractors to confine children and families to hotel rooms until they can be expelled. Lawyers who work with immigrant children have said they often don\\'t know who is being detained and where.\\n\\n\"The problem is we\\'re seeing children held for far longer than a few days, in some cases up to a month, in a hotel,\" said Carlos Holguin, a lawyer for the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law who opposed the Justice Department\\'s position.\\n\\nIn total, the U.S. has expelled at least 147,000 people since March, including 8,800 children unaccompanied by a parent, according to government figures filed in court in September. Most are not detained in hotels. Many of those people have been directly sent back across the U.S.-Mexico border. Others, including unaccompanied children, are held for days or weeks in Border Patrol facilities unequipped for long-term detention before they are taken to deportation flights.', 'As President-elect Joe Biden claimed victory Saturday, he and his running mate made history. \"While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last,\" said Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.\\n\\nThe California senator is heading back to Washington as the first woman on a winning presidential ticket.\\n\\n\"What a testament it is to Joe\\'s character, that he had the audacity to break one of the most substantial barriers that exists in our country and select a woman as his vice president,\" Harris said.\\n\\nDuring her acceptance speech Saturday, she honored all the women who came before her, and who courageously fought to protect and secure the right to vote, saying, \"I stand on their shoulders.\"\\n\\nVice President-elect Kamala Harris smiles during a victory celebration in Wilmington, Delaware, on Saturday, November 7, 2020.

Headers have been added for ease of reading.\\n\\n[0:00] Welker: A very good evening to both of you. This debate will cover six major topics. At the beginning of each section, each candidate will have two minutes, uninterrupted, to answer my first question. The debate commission will then turn on their microphone only when it is their turn to answer, and the commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired. After that, both microphones will remain on, but on behalf of the voters, I'm going to ask you to please speak one at a time. The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say. And so with that, if you're ready, let's start.\\n\\nAnd we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus. President Trump, the first question is for you. The country is heading into a dangerous new phase. More than 40,000 Americans are in the hospital tonight with COVID, including record numbers here in Tennessee. And since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 Americans have died from COVID. So please be specific: how would you leave the country during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis? Two minutes, uninterrupted.\\n\\nTrump and Biden on COVID-19\\n\\n[1:03] Trump: So, as you know, more 2.2 million people, modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It's a worldwide pandemic. It’s all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country. And we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida, and it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas, it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona, it's now gone. And there were some spikes and surges in other places. They will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that's coming, it's ready. It's going to be announced within weeks, and it's going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine. I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it. And I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me — a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure. But I was in for a short period of time and I got better very fast or I wouldn't be here tonight. And now they say I'm immune. Whether it's four months or a lifetime, nobody's been able to say that, but I'm immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that's a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I've been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we've been able to do with the — if you take a look at what we've done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators. We're now making ventilators. All over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as I say, we're rounding the turn, we're rounding the corner, it's going away.\\n\\n[3:05] Welker: OK, former Vice President Biden, to you, how would you lead the country out of this crisis? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\\n\\n[3:12] Biden: 220,000 Americans dead. If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this. Anyone who's responsible for not taking control — in fact, not saying, I take no responsibility, initially — anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America. We're in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day, a thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day. Compared to what's going on in Europe, as the New England Medical Journal said, they're starting from a very low rate. We're starting from a very high rate. The expectation is we'll have another 200,000 Americans dead by the time, between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks — the President's own advisors told them — we could save 100,000 lives. And we're in a circumstance where the President, thus far, still has no plan. No comprehensive plan. What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask, all the time. I would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe, and give them the wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that. We're in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal — one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world — said for the first time ever that this, the way this President has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. And so folks, I will take care of this, I will end this, I will make sure we have a plan.\\n\\n[5:00] Welker: President Trump, I'd like to follow up with you and your comments. You talked about taking a therapeutic. I assume you're referencing Regeneron. You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks. Is that a guarantee?\\n\\n[5:12] Trump: It is not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but I think it has a good chance. One or two companies, I think, within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly.\\n\\n[5:21] Welker: Can you tell us what companies?\\n\\nTrump: Johnson and Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well, and we have numerous others. And then we also have others that we're working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe.\\n\\n[5:34] Welker: Let me follow up with you, and because this is new information — You have said a vaccine is coming soon, within weeks now. Your own officials say it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated, and even then they say the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022. Is your timeline realistic?\\n\\n[5:52] Trump: No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don't know that they're counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular, that's the head of logistics. And this is a very easy distribution for him. He's ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine, and we expect to have 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine, he's ready to go.\\n\\n[6:12] Welker: Vice President Biden, your reaction? Just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government. What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved?\\n\\n[6:25] Biden: Make sure it's totally transparent. Have the scientific world see, know, look at it, go through all the processes. And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by Easter last time. This the same fellow who told you that, don't worry, we're going to end this by the summer. We're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan and there's no prospect that there's going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.\\n\\n[6:53] Welker: President Trump, your reaction? He says you have no plan.\\n\\n[6:55] Trump: I don’t think it’s going to be a dark winter at all. We're opening up our country. We've learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn't know at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January — months later he was saying I was xenophobic, I did it too soon. Now he's saying, ‘Oh, I should have, I should have, you know, moved quicker.’ But he didn't move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me. And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal. But it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said ‘It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn't know what we were doing.’ Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this. Also everything that he said about the way — every single move that he said we should make — that's what we've done, we've done all of it, but he was way behind us.\\n\\n[8:09] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response?\\n\\n[8:10] Biden: My responses is, he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from China. And he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that. In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there, in China, trying to get to Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was. What did the President say in January? He said no, he said, this is — he's being transparent, the president of China is being transparent. We owe hkim a debt of gratitude. We have to thank him. And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. And again, I go back to this, he had nothing. He did virtually nothing. And then he gets out of the hospital, and he talks about we're, this is, ‘Oh, don't worry. This is all going to be over soon.’ Come on, there's not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it’s going to be over soon.\\n\\n[9:02] Welker: President Trump, your reaction?\\n\\n[9:03] Trump: I did not say over soon. I say we're learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I don’t know, he's obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can’t do that. By the way, I, as the president, couldn't do that. I'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can't do that. And here’s — every, every meeting I had — every meeting I had — and I meet a lot of families, including Gold Star families and military families, every meeting I had — and I had to meet them, I had to, it would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, you know, this is dangerous. And you catch it. And you know, I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot, great doctors, great hospitals. And now, I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover. We can't close up our nation, we have to open our school, and we can't close up our nation, or you're not going to have a nation.\\n\\n[10:09] Welker: And of course the CDC has said young people can get sick with COVID-19 and can pass it. Vice President Biden, I want to talk broadly about strategy, though.\\n\\n[10:19] Biden: Can I respond to that?\\n\\n[10:20] Welker: 30 seconds please, and then I have a question.\\n\\n[10:22] Biden: Number one. He says that we're, you know, we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their, out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. Learning to live with it? Come on. We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous. When's the last time? Is it really dangerous, still? Are we dangerous? Tell the people, is it dangerous now? What should they do about the danger? And you say, I take no responsibility.\\n\\n[10:55] Welker: Let me talk about —\\n\\n[10:56] Trump: Excuse me.\\n\\n[10:57] Welker: Very quickly.\\n\\n[10:58] Trump: I take full responsibility. It's not my fault that it came here. It's China's fault. You know what, it's not Joe's fault that it came here either. It's China's fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves\\n\\n[11:15] Welker: Vice President Biden. as tracked is that when we knew was coming, when it hit.\\n\\n[11:16] Biden: The fact is, when we knew it was coming, when it hit — What happened? What did the President say? He said don't worry, it's going to go away, it’s going to be gone by Easter. Don't worry, the warm weather. Don't worry, maybe inject bleach — he said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. A whole range of things the President said. And even today, he thinks we are in control. We're about to lose 200,000 more people\\n\\n[11:42] Welker: President Trump.\\n\\n[11:43] Trump: Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this. When I closed, he said, I shouldn't have closed. And that went on for months. What Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, this is a terrible thing. You’re xenophobic. I think he called me racist, even, and because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. It just Joe, it doesn't —\\n\\n[12:12] Biden: I didn't say either of those things.\\n\\n[12:13] Trump: You certainly did.\\n\\n[12:16] Biden: I talked about his xenophobia in a different context. It wasn't about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.\\n\\n[12:23] Welker: All right, I want to talk about both of your different strategies to handling this.\\n\\n[12:26] Trump: He thought I shouldn't have closed the border. That’s obvious.\\n\\n[12:30] Welker: Do you wanna respond to that quickly, vice president?\\n\\n[12:33] Biden: No.\\n\\n[12:33] Welker: OK, let's talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this. Mr. Vice President, you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it. What do you say to Americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger depression, domestic and substance abuse, outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus?\\n\\n[12:51] Biden: What I would say is I'm going to shut down the virus, not the country. It’s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part — why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living and why they're concerned. Those other concerns are real. That's why he should have been — instead of in a sand trap at his golf course — he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity.\\n\\n[13:21] Welker: You haven't ruled out more shutdowns\\n\\n[13:24] Biden: Oh no, I'm not shutting down the nation but there are, look, they need standards. The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that's above a certain level, everybody says, slow up. More social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control, under more control. But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. For example schools — schools, they need a lot of money to open. They need to deal with ventilation systems, they need to deal with smaller classes, more teacher, more pods, and he's refused to support that money, or at least up to now\\n\\n[14:03] Welker: Let's talk about schools. President Trump —\\n\\n[14:05] Trump: Well, I think we have to respond, if I might.\\n\\n[14:07] Welker: Please, and then I have a follow up.\\n\\n[14:08] Trump: Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shutdowns but forget about him. His democrat governors — Cuomo in New York, you look at what's going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all — they are shut down so tight, and they're dying. They're dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shutdowns No, we're not going to shut down, and we have to open our schools. And it's like, as an example, I have a young son. He also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor, the second time, he was fine, it just went away. Young people, I guess it’s their immune system.\\n\\n[14:46] Welker: Let me follow up, President Trump. You've demanded schools open in person and insisted they can do it safely. But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike. What is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids, but also their teachers and families?\\n\\n[15:04] Trump: I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small, but I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We're not going to have a country. You can't do this, we can't keep this country closed. It is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs, they're committing suicide. There's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. There's abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. You know I've said it often — the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that's what's happening, and he wants to close down. He'll close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down.\\n\\n[15:49] Welker: Vice President Biden, your —\\n\\n[15:51] Biden: Simply not true. We're gonna be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be able to safely open, but we need resources to open. You need to be able to, for example, if you're gonna open a business, have social distancing within the business. You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether a person is, in fact, infected. You need to be able to trace. You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that we're going to make sure that we open safely. And by the way, all you teachers out there — not that many of you are going to die, so don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Come on.\\n\\n[16:37] Welker: President Trump, let me follow up with you quickly.\\n\\n[16:39] Trump: I will say this, if you go and look at what's happened to New York, ut's a ghost town. It's a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglas — these are restaurants that are dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting the plexiglas is unbelievably expensive, and it's not the answer. I mean, you're going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic? These are businesses that are dying, Joe, you can't do that to people, which again, take a look at New York and what's happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it. It was vibrant. It's dying. Everyone's leaving New York.\\n\\n[17:34] Welker: Vice President.\\n\\n[17:34] Biden: Take a look what New York has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying. And I don't look at this in terms of what he does, blue states and red states. They’re all the United States. And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They’re the red states. They are the states in the Midwest, they are the states in the upper Midwest, that's where the spike is occurring significantly, but they're all Americans. They're all Americans and what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one, make sure we get the help that the businesses need. The money's already been passed to do that. It's been out there since the beginning of this summer and nothing's happened.\\n\\nTrump: New York has lost more than 40,000 people. 11,000 people in nursing.\\n\\n[18:00] Welker: President Trump, what about —\\n\\n[18:02] Trump: When you say spike, take a look at what's happening in Pennsylvania, where they've had it closed. Take a look at what's happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband's the only one allowed to do anything. It's been like a prison. Now it was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina. They're having spikes and they've been closed, and they're getting killed financially. We can't let that happen, Joe, you can't let that happen. We have to open up and we understand that disease, we have to protect our seniors, we have to protect our elderly, we have to protect, especially, our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect them. We have the best testing in the world by far. That's why we have so many cases.\\n\\n[18:42] Welker: Let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section. President Trump, this week you called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's best known infectious disease expert, “a disaster.” You described him and other medical experts as “idiots.” If you're not listening to them, who are you listening to?\\n\\n[18:58] Trump: I'm listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony. But he did say, ‘don't wear masks.’ He did say, as you know, ‘this is not going to be a problem.’ I think he's a Democrat, but that's okay. He said, ‘this is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.’ When Joe says that, I said — Anthony Fauci said and others and many others. And I'm not knocking him. Nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was, nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. We've learned a lot, but Anthony said, ‘don't wear masks.’ Now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here’s his exact words: ‘This is no problem, this is going to go away soon.’ So he's allowed to make mistakes, he happens to be a good person.\\n\\n[19:43] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response, quickly and then we're going to move on to the next section.\\n\\n[19:45] Biden: My response is think about what the President knew in January and didn't tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse than — much worse — than the flu. He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn't want to tell us, didn't want to tell us because he didn't want us to panic. He didn't want us — Americans don't panic. He panicked. Well, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, ‘this is a really dangerous thing,’ and a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — had said, ‘sell short, because we gotta get moving. It's a dangerous problem.’\\n\\n[20:30] Trump: Well this is —\\n\\n[20:31] Welker: I’m going to give you 30 seconds to respond and then we're gonna move on.\\n\\n[20:33] Trump: I don't know if somebody went to Wall Street. You're the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don't take it. You have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money. And every time you raise money, deals are made. I could raise so much more money. As president and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America, I would blow away every record. But I don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn't be bringing up Wall Street. Because you're the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldn't believe. We don't need money. We have plenty of money. In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get. Don’t tell me about wall street.\\n\\n[21:15] Welker: All right, gentlemen, we're gonna move on.\\n\\n[21:17] Biden: Average contribution, $43.\\n\\nOn national security\\n\\n[21:18] Welker: All right, we're gonna move on to our next section which is national security. And I do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight. Just last night, top intelligence officials confirmed again that both Russia and Iran are working to influence this election. Both countries have obtained U.S. voter registration information, these officials say, and Iran sent intimidating messages to Florida voters. This question goes to you, Mr. Vice President, what would you do to put an end to this threat? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\\n\\n[21:48] Biden: I made it clear. And I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price. They will pay the price. It has been overwhelmingly clear in this election — I won't even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved. China has been involved to some degree, and now we learned that, that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if I'm elected. Interfering with American sovereignty. That's what's going on right now. They're interfering with American sovereignty. And to the best of my knowledge, I don't think the President said anything to Putin about it. I don't think he's talking a lot. I don't think he said a word. I don't know why he hasn't said a word to Putin about it. And I don't know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians. My guess is he’d probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians. But the point is this, folks. We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy — well, I won't, I shouldn't — I will — his buddy Rudy Giuliani. He's being used as a Russian pawn. He's being fed information that is Russian, that is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens. And then you find out that everything is going on here about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States because they know I know them, and they know me. I don't understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he's engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO. I don't know why he doesn't do it but it's worth asking the question. Why isn't that being done? Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price because they're affecting our sovereignty.\\n\\n[23:45] Welker: President Trump, same question to you. Let me, let me ask the question. You're gonna have two minutes to respond for two elections in a row now there has been substantial interference from foreign adversaries. What would you do in your next term to put an end to this? Two minutes, uninterrupted.\\n\\n[23:56] Trump: Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered. Joe got three and a half million dollars from Russia. And it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow’s wife. He got three and a half million dollars. Your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, you're gonna have to explain — why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia. I don't get money from Russia. Now, about your thing last night, I knew all about that, and through John — who is John Radcliffe, who is a fantastic DNI — he said, the one thing that's common to both of them, they both want you to lose. Because there has been nobody tougher to Russia. Between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia. Between the sanctions between all of what I've done with NATO. You know, I've got the NATO countries to put up an extra 130 billion, going to $420 billion a year, that's to guard against Russia. I sold — while he was selling pillows and sheets — I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. And I'll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the, the submarine port. You remember that very well during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it's even worse. All of the emails, the emails are horrible. The emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening. And it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago, who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now.\\n\\n[26:01] Welker: Vice President Biden, you may respond to follow up on the election security.\\n\\n[26:06] Biden: I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. We learn that this President paid 50 times the tax in China, as a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money? I have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever, ever, number one. Number two, this is a president — I have released all of my tax returns. 22 years. Go look at them. 22 years of my tax return. You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding? Why are you unwilling? The foreign countries are paying you a lot. Russia is paying you a lot. China is paying a lot. And your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world. And China's building a new road to a new gas… a golf course you have overseas. So what's going on here? Why don't you release your tax return or stop talking about corruption?\\n\\n[27:04]Welker: President Trump, your response.\\n\\n[27:06] Trump: First of all, I called my accounts — under audit. I'm going to release them as soon as we can. I want to do it, and it will show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. I asked them a week ago, I said, what did I pay? They said, sir, you pre-paid tens of millions of dollars. I prepaid my tax. Tens. Over the last number of years. Tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think, it's an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So, I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that.\\n\\n[27:42] Welker: Did your accountant tell you —\\n\\n[27:44] Trump: Excuse me. And it wasn't written whenever they write this. They keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee. But let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one. Number two, I don't make money from China, you do. I don't make money from Ukraine, you do. I don't make money from Russia. You made three and a half million dollars, Joe, and your son gave you. They even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. You're the big man, I think. I don't know, maybe you're not. But you're the big man, I think. You son said that we have to give 10% to the big man. Joe, what's that all about? It's terrible.\\n\\n[28:22] Welker: All right, gentlemen, I want to ask you both some questions about all of this. I'm gonna let you both respond, very quickly. You just said you spoke to your accountant about potentially releasing your taxes. Did he tell you when you can release them? Do you have a deadline for when you're going to release them to the American people?\\n\\n[28:35] Trump: I get treated worse than the Tea Party got treated. A lot of people in there, deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly. We made a deal, it was all settled, until I decided to run for president. I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done. As soon as we're completed with the deal, I want to release it. But I have paid millions and millions of dollars. And it's worse than paying. I paid in advance. It's called prepaying your taxes. I paid.\\n\\n[29:04] Welker: I want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly.\\n\\n[29:12] Biden: At some point I want to respond.\\n\\n[29:13] Welker: Respond very quickly, and then I'll get to my question.\\n\\n[29:15] Biden: Why do he — He's been saying this for four years. Show us. Just show us. Stop playing around. You’ve been saying for four years you’re going to release your taxes. Nobody knows, Mr. President, they do know is you're not paying your taxes or you're paying taxes that are so low. When last time he said what he paid, he said, ‘I only pay that little because I'm smart. I know how to game the system.’ Come on, come on, folks.\\n\\n[29:42] Welker: Quickly, President Trump, and then I want to get to two questions to both of you.\\n\\n[29:46] Trump: I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied on my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this. Mueller and 18 angry Democrats, and FBI agents all over the place spent, $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. I guarantee you, if I spent 1 million on you Joe, I could find plenty wrong, because the kind of things that you've done and the kind of monies that your family has taken — I mean, your brother made money in Iraq, millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and it's all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well. You have houses all over the place. You live very well.\\n\\n[30:41] Welker: All right, gentlemen, let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly. Vice President Biden, there have been questions about the work your son has done in China, and for Ukrainian energy company when you were Vice President. In retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical?\\n\\n[30:56] Biden: Nothing was unethical. Here's what the deal. With regard to Ukraine, we had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned, of Burisma, a company, that somehow I had done something wrong. Yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath who worked for him, said I did my job impeccably. I carried out US policy. Not one, single, solitary thing was out of line. Not a single thing, number one. Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy, trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do, and did not do, because it never, ever, ever happened. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about — what are you talking about — China. I have not had it. The only guy that made money from China is this guy. He’s the only one. Nobody else has made money from China.\\n\\n[31:58] Welker: Let me ask my question to you.\\n\\n[32:00] Trump: Could I just — one thing.\\n\\n[32:01] Welker: Very quickly.\\n\\n[32:02] Trump: His son didn't have a job for a long time, was sadly no longer in the military service, I won't get into that. And he didn't have a job. As soon as he became vice president, Burisma — not the best, not the best reputation in the world — I hear they paid him 183,000 a month. Listen to this, 183, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. That’s 100% dishonest.\\n\\n[32:27] Welker: I’m going to let the vice president respond to that quickly and then I have a question for you.\\n\\n[32:31] Biden: No basis for that. Everybody investigated that, no one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine.\\n\\n[32:35] Welker: OK, President Trump, this is for you. Since you took office, you've never divested from your business. You've personally promoted your properties abroad. A report this week, which was referenced, does indicate that your company has a bank account in China. So how can voters know that you don't have any foreign conflicts of interest?\\n\\n[32:52] Trump: I have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business. The bank account you're referring to — which is, everybody knows about it, it's listed — the bank account was in 2013. That's what it was. It was opened. It was closed in 2015, I believe, and then I decided, because I was going to do, I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it. And I decided I'm not going to do it, didn't like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it.\\n\\n[32:26] Welker: OK.\\n\\n[32:27] Trump: Excuse me, and then unlike him, where he's Vice President, and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that. That was before. So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference. He is the Vice President of the United States, and his son, his brother and his other brother are getting rich, they're like a vacuum cleaner, there's something —\\n\\n[33:54] Welker: We do need to move on. I do want to ask you, Vice President Biden, about China. Let's talk about China more broadly. There have, of course, President Trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus. If you were president, would you make China pay and please be specific, what would that look like?\\n\\nBiden: What I’d make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done. He has caused the deficit in China to go up not down — with China, go up not down. We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property. You have to get/have a partner in China, it is 51%. We would not do that at all, number one. Number two, we're in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well. When I met with Xi, and when I was still vice president, he said ‘we're setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea, you can't fly through them.’ I said, ‘we're gonna fly through them. We just flew B52/B1 bombers through it. We're not going to pay attention.’ They have to play by the rules, and what's he do? He embraces guys like the thugs like in North Korea, and, and, and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger in the eye of all our friends, all of our allies. We make up only — we’ re 25%. 25% of the world's economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us, saying to China, these are the rules. You play by them or you're going to pay the price for not paying by them, economically. That's the way I will run it. And that's what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice president.\\n\\n[35:33] Welker: All right, let's talk about North Korea.\\n\\n[35:35] Trump: Excuse me, no, I have to respond to this.\\n\\n[35:37] Welker: OK, very quickly and then we're gonna have...\\n\\n[35:39] Trump: His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China —\\n\\n[35:41] Biden: Not true.\\n\\n[35:42] Trump: — after spending 10 minutes in office and being an Air Force Two, number one. Number two, there's a very strong email, talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions.\\n\\n[35:56] Biden: That is not true.\\n\\n[35:56] Welker: President Trump, on China policy, though. What are you gonna do? What specifically are you going to do to make China pay?\\n\\n[36:03] Trump: First of all, China is paying. They’re paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion.\\n\\n[36:07] Welker: Through sanctions?\\n\\n[36:08] Trump: I just gave $28 billion to our farmers.\\n\\n[36:12] Biden: Taxpayers money.\\n\\n[36:14] Trump: It’s what?\\n\\n[36:15] Biden: Taxpayers money.\\n\\n[36:16] Trump: No, the taxpayers. It's called China.\\n\\n[36:20] Biden: Not true.\\n\\n[36:20] Trump: China pays for $28 billion and you know what they did to pay it, Joe? They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know who got the money? Our farmers. Our great farmers, because they would target it. You never charge them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry. We were not going to have a steel, and now we have a steel industry\\n\\n[36:42] Welker: OK, Vice President Biden, your response, please?\\n\\n[36:49] Biden: This isn't about me. There's a reason why he's bringing up all this malarkey. There's a reason for it. He doesn't want to talk about the substantive issues. It's not about his family and my family. It's about your family, and your family's hurting badly. If you're making less than, if you're a middle class family, you're getting hurt badly right now. You're sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, well, we can't get new tires, they’re bald, because we have to wait another month. Or, so are we going to be able to pay the mortgage? Who's going to tell her, she can't go back to community college? They're the decisions you're making in the middle class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymot. They're in trouble. We should be talking about your families but that's the last thing he wants to talk about.\\n\\n[37:26] Welker: I wanted to say, I want to tell —\\n\\n[37:28] Trump: That is a typical statement. Just 10 seconds, please.\\n\\n[37:29] Welker: 10 seconds Mr President, 10 seconds.\\n\\n[37:31] Trump: Just a typical political statement. Let's get off this China thing, and then he looks — the family, around the table, everything. Just a typical politician when I see that.\\n\\n[37:40] Welker: All right, let’s talk —\\n\\n[37:40] Trump: I’m not a typical politician, that’s why I got elected.\\n\\n[37:44] Welker: Let’s talk about —\\n\\n[37:44] Trump: Let’s get off the subject of China, let's talk around sitting around the table. Come on, Joe, you can do better.\\n\\n[37:48] Welker: We're gonna talk about North Korea now. President Trump, you've met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's three times. You've talked about your beautiful letters with him, you've touted the fact that there hasn't been a war or a long range missile test, and yet North Korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal. Do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship? Just 30 seconds here because we need to get on to the next topic.\\n\\n[38:12] Trump: When I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said the biggest problem we have is North Korea. He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what, it would be a nuclear war, and he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of relationship. We have a very good relationship, and there's no war. And you know, about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, ‘oh there's going to be trouble.’ I said, ‘No, they're not. Because he's not going to do that.’ And I was right. :ook, instead of being in a war where millions of people — Seoul, you know, is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people in Seoul — millions of people would be dead right now. We don’t have a war, and I have a good relationship.\\n\\n[39:05] Welker: Vice President Biden, North Korea conducted four nuclear tests under the Obama administration. Why do you think you would be able to rein in this persistent threat?\\n\\n[39:15] Biden: Because I'd make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because here's the root. I made it clear, as a spokesperson for the administration when I went to China, they said, ‘Why are you moving your missile defense up so close? Why are you moving more forces? Why are you continuing to do military maneuvers with South Korea?’ I said, ‘Because North Korea is a problem. And we're going to continue to do it so we can control them. We're going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up. And help if not, it's going to continue.’ What has he done? He's legitimized North Korea, he's talked about his good buddy who's a thug, a thug, and he talks about how we're better off, and they have much more capable missiles, able to reach U.S. territory, much more easily than ever did before.\\n\\n[40:05] Welker: Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden, you've said you wouldn't meet with Kim Jong Un without preconditions. Are there any conditions under which you would meet with him?\\n\\n[40:12] Biden: On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get there. The Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone.\\n\\n[40:21] Welker: All right, let's move on to American families.\\n\\n[40:24] Trump: Kristen, they tried to meet with him.\\n\\n[40:24] Welker: Very quickly. 10 seconds, President Trump.\\n\\nTrump: They tried to meet with him, he wouldn’t do it. He didn’t like Obama. He didn’t like him. He wouldn’t do it.\\n\\n[40:32] Welker: OK, I’ve got to give him a chance to respond.\\n\\n[40:33] Trump: They tried, he wouldn’t do it. And that’s okay. You know what, North Korea, we’re not in a war. We have a good relationship. You know, people don’t understand — having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing.\\n\\n[40:43] Welker: President Trump, we have to move on. We have a lot of questions to get through.\\n\\n[40:43] Biden: We had a good relationship with Hitler before he in fact invaded Europe, the rest of Europe. Come on. The reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said we’re gonna talk about denuclearization, we’re not gonna legitimize you, we’re gonna continue to put stronger and stronger sanctions on you. That’s why he wouldn’t meet with us.\\n\\n[41:10] Trump: And it didn’t happen.\\n\\n[41:12] Welker: Let’s move on and talk about American families.\\n\\n[41:14] Trump: Excuse me, he left me a mess, Kristen. They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess.\\n\\n[41:18] Welker: We need to move on so that we have time to get to all our questions tonight, President Trump.\\n\\n[41:22] Trump: Remember the first two or three months. There was a very dangerous period in my first three months, before we sort of worked things out a little bit. They left us a mess, and Obama would be – I think, the first to say — it was the single biggest problem, he thought, that our country had.\\n\\nOn the economy\\n\\n[41:47] Welker: All right, let's move on to American families and the economy. One of the issues that's most important to them is health care, as you both know. Today, there was a key vote on a new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and healthcare is at the center of her confirmation fight. Over 20 million Americans get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It's headed to the Supreme Court, and your administration, Mr. President, is advocating for the court to overturn it. If the supreme court does overturn that law, those 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight. So what would you do if those people have their health insurance taken away? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\\n\\nTrump: First of all, I've already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate -- we have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. I terminate it; it's gone. Now it's in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, ‘Run it as well as you can’ -- to my people, great people -- ‘Run it as well as you can.’ I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down, everything's down. Here's the problem. No matter how well you run it, it's no good. What we'd like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don't know that it's going to work. If we don't win, we will have to run it and we'll have Obamacare, but it will be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare. Because without the individual mandate, it is much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better. We’ll always protect people with pre existing -- so I'd like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care. The Democrats will do it because there'll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House at that time. And I think we're going to win the House, okay? You'll see, but I think we're gonna win the House. But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre existing conditions -- and one thing very important. We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than we're talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love the health care, people that have been successful -- middle income people -- been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine. He won't even have a choice. They want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job with health care. And we're going to do even better.\\n\\n45:12 Welker: OK. Vice President Biden, yes, this is for you. Your health care plan calls for building on Obamacare. So my question is, what is your plan if the law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\\n\\nBiden: What I'm going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option -- become Bidencare. Public option is an option that says that if you, in fact, do not have the wherewithal to be -- if you qualify for Medicaid, and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. That's what's going to happen. Secondly, we're going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there's competition that doesn't exist now by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance -- the reason why I had such a fight for, with 20 candidates for the nomination, was I support private insurance. That's why I did not -- not one single person, private insurance, would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance, unless they chose they wanted to go to something else. Lastly, we're going to make sure we're in a situation that we've actually protect pre existing -- there's no way he can protect pre existing conditions. None, zero, you can't do it in the ether. He's been talking about this for a long time. There is no -- he's never come up with a plan. I guess we're gonna get the pre existing condition plan the same time we get the infrastructure plan that we waited since 17, 18, 19, 20. The fact that -- I still have a little, a few more minutes, I know you're getting anxious -- the fact is that he’s already cost the American people because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have been under Obamacare, and over 110 million people with pre existing conditions. And all the people from COVID are going to have pre existing conditions. What are they going to do?\\n\\n47:20 Welker: I have a follow up for you, Vice President Biden, it relates to something that President Trump said. He's accusing you of wanting socialized medicine. What do you say to people who have concerns that your health care plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes the country one step closer to a health care system run entirely by the government?\\n\\nBiden: What he’s saying, it's ridiculous. It’s like saying that, you know, we're the idea that, the fact that there's a public option that people can choose, that makes the socialist plan? Look, the difference between the president -- I think health care is not a privilege, it's a right. Everyone should have the right to have affordable health care. And I am very proud of my plan. It's gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as, as well as a whole range of other people who in fact, are concerned in the medical field. This is something that's going to save people's lives. And this is going to give some people an opportunity, an opportunity to have health care for their children, how many of you home are worried and rolling around in bed at night wondering what in God's name are you going to do if you get sick? Because you've lost your home insurance, your health insurance, your company's gone under. We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that's what I do.\\n\\nWelker: President Trump, your response.\\n\\nTrump: Excuse me, he was there for 47 years -- he didn't do it. He was now there as Vice President for eight years. And it's not like it was 25 years ago, it was three and three quarters. It was just a little while ago, right? Less than four years ago. He didn't do anything. He didn't do it. He wants socialized medicine. And it's not that he wants it, his vice president -- I mean, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more, Bernie Sanders wants it, the Democrats want it. You're going to have socialized medicine. Just like you went on with fracking -- ‘We're not going to have fracking, we're going to stop fracking, we're going to stop fracking.’ Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets the nomination -- well he got very lucky to get it. And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, ‘Oh, we're gonna have fracking.’ And you never asked a question. And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you're handling this, I have to say. But by the way, somebody should ask the question. He goes for a year --\\n\\n49:24 Welker: We do have a number of -- we have a number of topics.\\n\\nTrump: No, no, but that's a question --\\n\\nWelker: We're gonna get to it --\\n\\nTrump: It’s the same thing with socialized medicine.\\n\\nWelker: Vice President, your response.\\n\\nBiden: My response is people deserve to have affordable health care -- period. Period, period, period. And the Bidencare proposal will, in fact, provide for that affordable health care, lower premiums. What we're going to do is going to cost some money; it's going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it. And they're going to have lower premiums, you can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly. He keeps talking about it. He hasn't done a thing for anybody on health care, not a thing.\\n\\nTrump: Kristen, when he says --\\n\\nWelker: Very quickly, then I want to talk about what’s happening on Capitol Hill\\n\\n50:08 Trump: When he says public health option, he is talking about socialized medicine and health care. When he talks about a public option, he's talking about destroying your Medicare, totally destroying -- he’s destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. You know, Bernie Sanders tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor, they wanted to make it work --\\n\\nWelker: Let's see if --\\n\\n50:31 Trump: -- it was impossible --\\n\\nWelker: Vice President Biden, your response.\\n\\n50:34 Biden: He thinks he's running against someone else. He's running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden, he's running against. And the idea that we're in a situation and want to destroy Medicare -- this is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, ‘If in fact’ -- and, social security -- ‘If, in fact, he continues to withhold his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023, with no way to pay for it. This is a guy who's tried to cut Medicare. So I don't know. I mean, the idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare? Come on.\\n\\nTrump: He tried to get rid of --\\n\\nWelker: Vice Presiden, Mr. President, I’m going to have to go on to another question --\\n\\nTrump: -- he tried to hurt Social Security years ago, years ago. Go back and look at the records. He tried to hurt Social Security you've got --\\n\\n51:28 Welker: All right, let’s move on to the next question.\\n\\n51:31 Trump: They say the stock market will rule if I'm elected. If he's elected, the stock market will crash.\\n\\nWelker: OK, let's move on to the next question.\\n\\nBiden: May I respond?\\n\\nWelker: Very quickly.\\n\\n51:40 Biden: The idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening. Where I come from, in Scranton and Claymont, the people don't live off of the stock market. Just in the last three, three years during this crisis, the billionaires in this country made, according to the Wall Street, $700 billion more dollars. $700 billion more dollars. Because that's his only measure. What happens to the ordinary people out there? What happens to them?\\n\\n52:11 Trump: 401k’s are through the roof. 401k --\\n\\nWelker: All right, let’s move on.\\n\\n52:14 Trump: -- are through the roof. And he doesn't come from Scranton. That's like, what -- he lived there for a short period of time before he even knew --\\n\\nWelker: We're gonna move on --\\n\\nTrump: And he left. And the people of Pennsylvania will tell you that.\\n\\nWelker: -- to my next question, gentlemen. As of tonight, more than 12 million people are out of work. And as of tonight, 8 million more homes have fallen into poverty, and more families are going hungry every day. Those hit hardest are women and people of color. They see Washington fighting over a relief bill. Mr. President, why haven't you been able to get them the help they need? 30 seconds here.\\n\\nTrump: Because Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve it. I do.\\n\\nWelker: But you're the president.\\n\\nTrump: I do. But I still have to get, unfortunate -- that's one of the reasons I think we're going to take over the House, because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve anything. She'd love to have some victories on a date called November 3. Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing and able to do something. Don't forget, we've already approved three plans. And it's gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness. This one she doesn't want. It's near the election, because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically.\\n\\nWelker: All right, Mr. Vice President --\\n\\nBiden: You know, the Republican leader in the United States Senate said he can't -- he will not pass it. He does not have Republican votes. Why isn’t he talking to his Republican friends?\\n\\nWelker: Let me follow up with you, Vice President\\n\\nTrump: If we made a deal, we’d have --\\n\\n53:32 Welker: Let me ask Vice President Biden the question. You are the leader of the Democratic Party. Why have you not [] Democrats to get a deal for the American people?\\n\\nBiden: Well, I have and they have pushed it. Look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer. This is like -- it's not new. It's been out there. The HEROES Act has been sitting there. And look at what's happening. When I was in charge of the Recovery Act with $800 billion, I was able to get $145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budget to states that have to balance their budgets, so then they have to fire fire -- they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they can keep their cities and counties running. He will not support that. They have not done a thing for them. And Mitch McConnell said, ‘Let him go bankrupt. Let him go bankrupt.’ Come on. What's the matter with these --\\n\\nTrump: The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrats, cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars to these cities. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people's pockets to people that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them. And what that does, and I'd love to do that, I'd love to help them. But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can't do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of sending them things that had nothing to do with COVID, as for your question, but it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states.\\n\\nWelker: I want --\\n\\nBiden: All right, if I get elected, I'm not gonna -- I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm gonna be an American president. I don't see red states and blue states. What I see is American United States. And folks, every single state out there finds themselves in trouble. They're going to start laying off, whether they're red or blue. Cops, firefighters, first responders, teachers -- because they have to balance their budget. And the founders were smart. They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America.\\n\\nWelker: I want to talk about the minimum wage, gentlemen. Mr. Vice President, we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses and business owners today. Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage? You, of course, support a $15 minimum wage.\\n\\nBiden: I do, because I think one of the things we’re gonna have to do is we're gonna have to bail them out, too. We should be bailing them out now, those small businesses. You’ve got one in six of them going under. They're not going to be able to make it back. They passed a package that allows us to be able to call PPP, money that’s supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they could deal with their businesses being open safely. Schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in. They need the help, the businesses, as well as the schools, need the help. But this, these guys will not help them. He is not giving them any of the money.\\n\\nWelker: We are going to move on --\\n\\n56:35 Trump: For small businesses -- by raising the minimum wage and helping, I think it should be a state option. Alabama is different than New York, New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option. So it's very important. We have to help our small business --\\n\\nWelker: You said --\\n\\nTrump: How are you helping small businesses, when you're forcing wages. What's going to happen and what's been proven to happen is when you do that these firemen\\n\\n57:03 Welker: Well you said you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 a hour --\\n\\nTrump: Say again?\\n\\nWelker: You said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Is that still the case?\\n\\n57:10 Trump: What I’d really like, I would consider it to an extent. I really like what I -- in a second administration -- but not to a level that's going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option. Look, I have a read on different places, I know different places. They’re all different. Some places, $15 is not so bad. In other places, other states, $15 --\\n\\nWelker: OK, President Trump, thank you. Quick response, Vice President Biden\\n\\nBiden: Two jobs, one job below poverty. People are making 6, 7, 8 bucks an hour. These first responders we all clap for as they come down the street, because they've allowed us to make it. What's happening? They deserve a minimum wage of $15. Anything below that put you below the poverty level. And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, business has gone out of business. That is simply not true.\\n\\nOn immigration\\n\\nWelker: We're going to talk about immigration. We're going to talk about immigration, now, gentlemen, and we're going to talk about families within this context. Mr. President, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4000 kids, You've since reversed your zero tolerance policy, but the United States can't locate the parents of more than 500 children. So how will these families ever be reunited?\\n\\nTrump: Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels, and they're brought here and it’s easy to use them to get into our country. We now have a stronger border as we've ever had. We’re over 400 miles of brand new wall, you see the numbers, and we let people in, but they have to come in legally.\\n\\nWelker: But how will you reunite these kids with their families?\\n\\n58:48 Trump: Let me just say. They built cages. You know, they used to say I built the cages. And then they had a picture in the newspaper. There was a picture of these horrible cages and they said, ‘Look at these cages, President Trump built them.’ And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him.\\n\\nWelker: Do you have a plan to reunite the kids?\\n\\n59:08 Trump: Yes, we're working on a very -- we're trying very hard. But a lot of these kids come up without the parents, they come over through cartels and the coyotes and through gangs.\\n\\nWelker: Vice President Biden, let me bring you into this conversation. Quick response and then another question to you.\\n\\nBiden: These 500 plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. Big real tough, really strong. And guess what? They cannot -- it’s not coyotes that bring them over, their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents. And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every judge of who we are as a nation.\\n\\nWelker: Let me ask you a follow up --\\n\\nTrump: Kristen, they did it, we changed the policy. They did it. We changed it. They set up the cages. They -- who built the cages?\\n\\nBiden: So let's talk about --\\n\\nTrump: Who built the cages, Joe?\\n\\n59:58 Biden: Let’s talk about what we’re talking about. What happened? Parents were ripped -- their kids were ripped from their arms and separated. And now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go, nowhere to go. It's criminal. It's criminal.\\n\\nWelker: Let me just --\\n\\nTrump: Let me say this. They worked it out, we brought reporters and everything. They are so well taken care of. They're in facilities that were so clean --\\n\\nWelker: But some of them haven’t been reunited --\\n\\nTrump: But just answer one question. Who built the cages? A big ask of that, who built the cages?\\n\\nWelker: Let me ask about your immigration policy, Mr. Vice President. The Obama administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration. It also presided over record deportations as well as family detentions at the border before changing course. So why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now?\\n\\nBiden: Because we made a mistake. It took too long to get it right. Too long to get it right. I'll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States. And the fact is, and I’ve made it very clear, within 100 days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people. And all those so called Dreamers, those DACA kids, they're going to be legally certified again, to be able to stay in this country, and put on a path to citizenship. The idea that they are being sent home by this guy, and they want to do, that is they go to a country they've never seen before. I can imagine you're five years old, your parents are taking you across the Rio Grande River and it’s and it's illegal. You say ‘Oh, no, Mom, leave me here. I'm not gonna go with you.’ They’ve been here. Many of them are model citizens. 20,000 are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them. We owe them.\\n\\n1:01:51 Welker: President Trump, your response.\\n\\nTrump: He had eight years to do what he said he was going to do. And I've changed without having a specific -- we get rid of catch and release, got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they live with. But he had eight years he was vice president. He did nothing except build cages to keep children in.\\n\\nWelker: Vice President, what’s your response?\\n\\nBiden: The catch and release, you know what he's talking about there? If in fact, you had family, came across, they're arrested. They, in fact, were given a date to show up for their hearing. They were released. And guess what, they showed up for the hearing. This is the first President in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country. That's never happened before. That’s never happened before in our country. You come to the United States and you make your case. That’s how you seek asylum, based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law. They're sitting in squalor on the other side of the river.\\n\\n1:02:55 Welker: President Trump, there is --\\n\\nTrump: It’s so important. It shows that he has no understanding of immigration of the laws. Catch and release is a disaster. A murderer would come in, a rapist would come in, a very bad person would come in -- we would take their name, we have to release them into our country. And then you say they come back. Less than 1% of the people come back.\\n\\nBiden: Not true.\\n\\nTrump: We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them. We would say, ‘Come back in two years, three years -- we're going to give you a court case. You did Perry Mason, we're going to give you a court case. When you say they come back, they don't come back, Joe. They never come back. Only the really -- I hate to say this -- but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back.\\n\\nWelker: OK, President Trump, let’s give Vice President Biden a chance to respond, and then we're going to move on to the next section.\\n\\nTrump: You don’t know the law, Joe.\\n\\nWelker: Vice President Biden, your response.\\n\\nBiden: I know the law. What he's telling you is simply not true.\\n\\nTrump: They don’t come back.\\n\\nBiden: Check it out.\\n\\nWelker: All right, let's move on --\\n\\nTrump: But we don’t have to worry about it because I terminated it. So we don’t have to worry about it\\n\\n1:03:59 Welker: All right, let’s move on to the next section --\\n\\n1:04:04 Biden: You have 525 kids not knowing where in God’s name they’re going to be and lost their parents.\\n\\nTrump: Go ahead.\\n\\nOn race in America\\n\\nWelker: All right. Let's talk about our next section, which is race in America. And I want to talk about the way Black and Brown Americans experience race in this country. Part of that experience is something called “the talk.” It happens regardless of class and income -- parents who feel they have no choice but to prepare their children for the chance that they could be targeted, including by the police, for no reason other than the color of their skin. Mr. Vice President, in the next two minutes, I want you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?\\n\\nBiden: I do. I do. You know, my daughter is a social worker. And she's written a lot about this. She's got a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work. So, one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90 percent African American, was to learn more about what was going on. When I didn't -- I never had to tell my daughter if she's pulled over, make sure she puts, for traffic stop, puts both hands on top of the wheel. And don't reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you. But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you're walking down the street, don't have a hoodie on when you go across the street, making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, just Yes or No sir, just hands on top of the wheel. Because you are in fact, the victim, whether you're a person making 300,000 -- $300,000-a-year person, or someone who's on food stamps. The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America. And we have always said we've never lived up to it. Do we hold these truths to be sovereign, are all men and women are created equal? Guess what -- we have never ever lived up to it. We have constantly been moving the needle further and further between inclusion and exclusion. This is the first president come along and says that's the end of that. We're not going to do that anymore. We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better health care, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses. All the things we can do. And I've laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things. Just to give people a shot. It's about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence.\\n\\n1:06:32 Welker: President Trump, same question to you. And let me remind you of the question, I would like you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?\\n\\nTrump: Yes, I do. And again, he's been in government 47 years. He never did a thing except in 1994, when he did such harm to the Black community. And they were called, and he called them, super predators. And he said that, he said it -- super predators. And they can never live that down. 1994, your crime bill, the super predators. Nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln--possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I've done. Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn't do it. I don't even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might have wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms I had a twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. And everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my office--they cried in the Oval Office. Two weeks later, they're out saying, ‘Gee, we have to defeat him.’ Criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, a great senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones. It’s one of the most successful programs. People don't talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made. Biggest beneficiary, the Black and Hispanic communities and then historically Black colleges and universities. After three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great, they came into the office. And they said-- I said, ‘What are you doing after three years?’ I said, ‘Why do you keep coming back?’ ‘Because we have no funding’. I said, ‘You don't have to come back every year’, ‘We have to come back’, because President Obama would never give them long term funding. And I did. Ten-year, long term funding, and I give them more money than they asked for, because I said, ‘I think you need more’. And I said, ‘The only bad part about this is I may never see you again’, because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them. But I saved colleges and universities.\\n\\n[1:08:28] Welker: OK. And we're going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that Vice President?\\n\\n[1:08:33] Biden: My response to that is I never, ever said what he accused me of saying. The fact of the matter is, in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said, ‘The problem with the crime bill, there's not enough people in jail. There's not enough people in jail,’ and go on my website, get the quote the date when he said it, ‘not enough people’. He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, the people who are going to mauraud our cities. This is a guy who when the Central Park five, five innocent Black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty. None of them were-- none of them were guilty of what the crime, of the crimes that were suggested. Look, and talk about he, granted, he did in fact let 20 people-- he committed 20 people’s sentences. We committed over 1,000 people’s sentences. Over 1,000. The very law he's talking about is a law that, in fact, initiated by Barack Obama. And secondly, we're in a situation here where we-- the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration. And one of the things we should be doing is there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law. That's why I'm offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. Nobody should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and that's what I'm going to do.\\n\\n[1:10:04] Trump: But why didn't he do it four years ago? Why didn't you do that four years ago, even less than that? Why didn't you--\\n\\n[1:10:10] Biden: I am not--\\n\\n[1:10:10] Trump: You were vice president. You keep talking about all these things you're going to do and you're going to do this. But you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing.\\n\\n[1:10:19] Biden: We did--\\n\\n[1:10:20] Trump: You know, Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I said you did a good job, I would have never run. I would've never run. I ran because of you. I'm looking at you now, you're a politician. I ran because of you.\\n\\n[1:10:34] Welker: All right, Vice President Biden, your response to that? And then I do have some questions for both of you.\\n\\n[1:10:38] Biden: Well, I’ll tell you what, I hope he does look at me because what's happening here is you know who I am, you know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth. I am anxious to have this race. I'm anxious to see this take place. I am-- the character of the country is on the ballot. Our character is on the ballot. Look at us closely.\\n\\n[1:11:00] Welker: Let me ask them some follow--\\n\\n[1:11:01] Trump: Excuse me--\\n\\n[1:11:04] Welker: Please respond and then we’re gonna have follow up questions.\\n\\n[1:11:05] Trump: If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, a wreck-- If this is true, then he's a corrupt politician. So don't give me the stuff about how you're this innocent baby. Joe, they're calling you a corrupt politician--\\n\\n[1:11:19] Biden: Nobody says--\\n\\n[1:11:20] Welker: President Trump, I want to stay on the issue of race. We're talking about the issue--\\n\\n[1:11:21] Trump: It’s the laptop from hell. The laptop from hell.\\n\\n[1:11:25] Welker: President Trump, we’re talking about race right now and I do want to speak on the issue of race. President Trump---\\n\\n[1:11:29] Biden: Nobody-- Kristen, I have to respond to that.\\n\\n[1:11:30] Welker: Please, very quickly.\\n\\n[1:11:32] Biden: Look, there are 50 former National Intelligence folks who said that what this, he's accusing me of is a Russian plan. They have said that this has all the characteristics-- four-- five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him, his, and his good friend Rudy Giuliani.\\n\\n[1:11:51] Trump: You mean, the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax? You gotta be--\\n\\n[1:11:58] Biden: That’s exactly what-- That’s exactly what--\\n\\n[1:12:00] Trump: Is this where you’re going? This is where he’s going. The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia?\\n\\n[1:12:03] Welker: Gentleman, I want to stay on the issue of race, okay--\\n\\n[1:12:05] Trump: You have to be kidding here. Here we go again with Russia.\\n\\n[1:12:09] Welker: Mr. President, we're gonna continue on the issue of race. Mr. President, you've described the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of hate. You've shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters. You've said that Black professional athletes exercising their first amendment rights should be fired. What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?\\n\\n[1:12:32] Trump: Well you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter they were chanting ‘Pigs in a blanket’, talking about police, ‘Pigs, Pigs’, talking about our police, ‘Pigs in a blanket, fry' em like bacon’. I said, ‘That's a horrible thing’. And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter. I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room.\\n\\n[1:13:03] Welker: What do you say to men who are concerned by that rhetoric?\\n\\n[1:12:06] Trump: I don't, I don't know what to say. I got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and opportunity zones. I took care of Black colleges and universities. I don't know what to say. They can say anything. I mean, they can say anything. It's a very-- it makes me sad because I am the least racist person. I can't even see the audience because it's so dark, but I don't care who's in the audience. I’m the least racist person in this room.\\n\\n[1:13:35] Welker: OK. Vice President Biden, let me ask you, very quickly, and then I have a follow up question for you.\\n\\n[1:13:39] Biden: Abraham Lincoln. Here is one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history. He pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. He started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he’s gonna get rid of those Mexican rapists. He's banned Muslims because they're Muslims. He has moved around and made everything worse across the board. He says to them about the ‘Poor Boys’, last time we were on stage here. He said, ‘I told him to stand down and stand ready’. Come on. This guy has a dog whistle about as big as a fog horn.\\n\\n[1:14:12] Welker: President Trump, I'm going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then have a follow up question.\\n\\n[1:14:16] Trump: He made a reference to Abraham Lincoln. Where did that come in? I mean--\\n\\n[1:14:19] Biden: You said you were Abraham Lincoln.\\n\\n[1:14:21] Trump: No, no. I said not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the Black community. I didn’t say ‘I'm Abraham Lincoln’. I said, ‘Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done but what I've done for the Black community’. Now you have done nothing other than the crime bill, which put--\\n\\n[1:14:42] Biden: Oh, God.\\n\\n[1:14:42] Trump: Tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail. And you know what? They remember it because it you look at what’s happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly. Just take a look at what’s happening out there.\\n\\n[1:14:50] Welker: All right, let me-- Let me ask Vice President Biden about-- Vice President Biden, let me give you a chance to respond within this context. Crime bill that you supported in the 80s and 90s contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession. They are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, they’re uncles whose families are still to this day, some of them, suffering the consequences. So speak to those families, why should they vote for you?\\n\\n[1:15:20] Biden: One of the things that is said, in the '80s, we passed 100%, all 100 senators voted for it, a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs. It was a mistake. I've been trying to change it since then, particularly the portion on cocaine. That's why I've been arguing that, in fact, we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense. They should be going into treatment across the board. That's what we should be spending money on. That's why I set up drug courts which were never funded by republican friends. They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem. They should be going into treatment. Treatment. That's what we've been trying to do. That's what I'm going to get done because they may-- the American people have now seen that in fact, it was a mistake to pass those laws where they do the drug. But they were not in the crime bill.\\n\\n[1:16:12] Trump: But why didn't he get it done? See, it's all talk no action with these politicians. Why didn't he get it? ‘That's what I'm gonna do when I become president’. You were vice president, along with Obama as your President, your leader, for eight years. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years to get it done? Now, you're saying you're gonna get it done because you're all talk and no action, Joe.\\n\\n[1:16:34] Biden: We got a lot of it done. We released 38,000-- We got 38,000 prisoners left from--\\n\\n[1:16:39] Trump: You got nothing done\\n\\n[1:16:40] Biden: 38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison. We have-- there were over 1000 people who were given clemency. We-- in fact, we’re the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern of practice of the police departments and what they were doing, how they were conducting themselves. I could go on, but we began the process. We began the process. We lost an election. That's why I'm running to win back that election and change his terrible policy.\\n\\n[1:1:08] Trump: I just ask-- I just ask one question: why didn't you do it in the eight years, a short time ago? Why didn't you do it? You just said, ‘I'm going to do that. I'm going to do this.’ You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison. Now you're saying you're going to get-- you're going to undo that. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years with Obama? You know why, Joe, because you're all talk and no action.\\n\\n[1:17:29] Welker: All right, Vice President Biden and then we're gonna move on to the next section.\\n\\n[1:17:34] Biden: We had a Republican Congress. That’s the answer.\\n\\n[1:17:37] Welker: OK.\\n\\n[1:17:39] Trump: Well, you gotta talk-- you gotta talk 'em into it, Joe. Sometimes you gotta talk ‘em into it.\\n\\n[1:17:43] Welker: All right, we’re gonna move on to our next section which is climate change-\\n\\n[1:17:44] Trump: Like I did with criminal justice reform. I had to talk Democrats into it.\\n\\nOn climate change\\n\\n[1:17:48] Welker: Gentlemen, we’re running out of time so we gotta get on to climate change, please. You both have very different visions on climate change. President Trump, you say that environmental regulations have hurt jobs in the energy sector. Vice President Biden, you have said you see addressing climate change as an opportunity to create new jobs. For each of you, how would you both combat climate change and support job growth at the same time? Starting with you, President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.\\n\\n[1:18:15] Trump: So we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs. I do love the environment, but what I want the cleanest, crystal clear water, the cleanest air. We have the best, lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time. Not Joe. I haven't heard him use the term because I'm not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it. And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we've had in 35 years. Under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but what we can’t do-- Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India. It's filthy. The air is filthy. The Paris Accord, I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly. When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice. They were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord. It was so unfair. China doesn't kick in until 2030. Russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away. It would-- It would have been-- It would have destroyed our businesses. So, you ready? We have done an incredible job environmentally. We have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we've seen in many, many years.\\n\\n[1:19:50] Welker: Vice President, Biden--\\n\\n[1:19:51] Trump: And we haven't destroyed our industries.\\n\\n[1:19:52] Welker: Vice President Biden, two minutes to you uninterrupted.\\n\\n[1:19:55] Biden: Climate change, climate warming, global warming is an existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it. And we're told by all the leading scientists in the world that we don't have much time. We're going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years. Four years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up-- to limit the-- limit of admissions will put us in a position where we're going to be in real trouble. Here's where we have a great opportunity, I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as labor, people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan. Because what it does, it will create millions of new, good-paying jobs. We're going to invest in, for example, 500,000-- 50,000, excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market in the future. In the meantime, China's doing that. We're going to be in a position where we're going to see to it that we're going to take 4 million existing billion, buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don't leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating a significant number of jobs. And by the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it's going to create millions of jobs and it's going to clean the environment. Our health and our jobs are at stake. That's what's happening. And we-- right now, by the way, Wall Street firm has indicated that my plan-- My plan will, in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his. This from Wall Street and I’ll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does, not on climate just on the economy.\\n\\n[1:21:47] Trump: President Trump, your response --\\n\\n[1:21:48] Trump: They came out and said very strongly, ‘$6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan’, that his plan is an economic disaster. If you look at what he wants to do, you know if you look at his plan, you know, you know who developed it? AOC+3. They know nothing about the climate. I mean, she's got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate. And they're all hopping through hoops for AOC+3. Look, they’re real play costs $100 trillion. If we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years, we would not even come close to a number like that. When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows. As far as they're concerned, if you had no window it would be a lovely thing. This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen. And this wasn't done by smart people. This wasn't done by anybody. Frankly, I don't even know how it can be good politically. They want to spend $100 trillion. That's their real number. He's trying to say it was six. It’s $100 trillion. They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little tiny, small windows and many other things. And many other things--\\n\\n[1:22:47] Welker: All right-- Okay, let me have the vice president respond and we're running out of time and we have a lot more questions. So let's hear from the Vice President. I have a number of more questions.\\n\\n[1:23:11] Biden: I don't know where he comes from. I don’t know where he comes up with these numbers. $100 trillion? Give me a break. This plan was-- This plan has been endorsed by every major-- every major environmental group and every labor group. Labor. Because they know the future lies, the future lies in us being able to breath. And they know they're good jobs in getting us there. And by the way, the fastest growing industry in America are--is, is, is the electric--excuse me, solar energy and wind. He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills. It’s the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages, 45-50 bucks an hour. We can grow and we can be cleaner, if we go the route I’m proposing.\\n\\n[1:24:00] Welker: President Trump-- Please respond and then I have a follow up.\\n\\n[1:24:00] Trump: Excuse me. We are energy independent for the first time. We don't need all of these countries that we had a fight war over because we needed their energy. We are energy independent. I know more about wind than you do. It’s extremely expensive, kills all the birds, it’s very intermittent. It's got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China. And the fumes coming up-- If you're a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make-- make these massive windmills is more than anything that we're talking about with natural gas, which is very clean. One other thing--\\n\\n[1:24:36] Biden: Find me a scientist that says that.\\n\\n[1:24:38] Trump: Solar. I love solar, but solar doesn't quite have it yet. It's not powerful enough yet to-- to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world--\\n\\n[1:24:47] Biden: False.\\n\\n[1:24:47] Trump: So, it's all a pipe dream, but you know what we'll do? We're gonna have the greatest economy in the world. But if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry. You want-- And what about fracking?\\n\\n[1:25:01] Welker: All right. Let me allow Vice President Biden to respond--\\n\\n[1:25:04] Biden: I have never said I oppose fracking.\\n\\n[1:25:06] Trump: You said it on tape.\\n\\n[1:25:08] Biden: I did? Show the tape. Put it on your website.\\n\\n[1:25:10] Trump: I’ll put it on.\\n\\n[1:25:11] Biden: Put it on the website. The fact of the matter is he’s flat lying.\\n\\n[1:25:15] Welker: Would you rule out banning fracking?\\n\\n[1:25:17] Biden: I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need-- We need other industries to transition to get to, ultimately, a complete zero emissions by 2025. What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking. Capture the emissions from gas. We can do that and we can do that by investing money into-- It's a transition to that.\\n\\n[1:25:44] Welker: I have one more question--\\n\\n[1:25:48] Trump: Excuse me. He was against fracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow. ‘I am against fracking’, until he got the nomination, went to Pennsylvania than he said-- You know what, Pennsylvania? He'll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it.\\n\\n[1:26:00] Biden: Fracking on federal Land, I said. No fracking or oil on federal land--\\n\\n[1:26:05] Welker: Let me ask this final question in this section and then I want to move on to our final section. President Trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants. In Texas there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick. Your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities. Why should these families give you another four years in office?\\n\\n[1:26:26] Trump: The families that we're talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they've ever made. If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian, it's nice times greater, the percentage gain than it was under-- in three years-- than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely. Nine times more. Now, somebody lives-- I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you're saying-- But they're making a tremendous amount of money. Economically, we saved it. And I saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. We saved it. We got-- Say what you want of that relationship, we got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back. We saved our oil industry and now it's very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. Remember that.\\n\\n[1:27:22] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response and then we're going to have a final question for both of you.\\n\\n[1:27:26] Biden: My response is that those people live on what they call ‘Fence Lines’. He doesn't understand this. They live near chemical plants that, in fact, pollute. Chemical plants, and oil plants and refineries that pollute. I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claremont, Delaware. And all the more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is anyplace, including in Houston at the time. When my mom would get the car when they're first frost to drive me to school, turned on the windshield wipers there’d be oil slick in the window. That's why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer. The fact is those frontline communities, it doesn't matter what you're paying them. It matters how you keep them safe. What do you do? And you impose restrictions on the pollution, that the pollutants coming out of those fenceline communities.\\n\\n[1:28:12] Welker: OK, I have one final question--\\n\\n[1:28:14] Trump: Would you close down the-- Would you close down the oil industry?\\n\\n[1:28:17] Biden: I would transition from the oil industry. Yes.\\n\\n[1:28:19] Trump: Oh, transition.\\n\\n[1:28:21] Biden: It is a big statement because I would stop--\\n\\n[1:28:22] Welker: Why would you do that?\\n\\n[1:28:24] Biden: Because the oil industry significantly — but here's the deal —\\n\\n[1:28:27] Trump: That’s a big statement.\\n\\n[1:28:31] Biden: Well, if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time. Over time. And I’d stop giving to the oil industry-- I’d stop giving them federal subsidies. You won't give federal subsidies to the gas and, excuse me, to solar and wind. Why are we giving it to the oil industry?\\n\\n[1:28:52] Trump: We actually do give it to solar and wind--\\n\\n[1:28:54] Welker: All right, we have one final question--\\n\\n[1:28:56] Trump: That’s the biggest statement. In terms of business. that's the biggest statement.\\n\\n[1:28:59] Welker: All right, we have one final question-- Mr. President--\\n\\n[1:29:00] Trump: Because basically what he’s saying is he’s going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania? Oklahoma? Ohio?\\n\\n[1:29:07] Welker: Vice President Biden, let me give you ten seconds to respond and then I have to get to the final question. Vice President Biden?\\n\\n[1:29:12] Biden: He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward a net zero emissions. The first place to do that by the year 2025 is in energy production. By 2050, totally.\\n\\n[1:29:25] Welker: All right. One final question--\\n\\n[1:29:26] Trump: Is he gonna get China to do it? Is he going to get China to do it?\\n\\n[1:29:27] Welker: No, we're finished with this. We have to move on to our final question.\\n\\n[1:29:30] Biden: No, I’m going to rejoin the Paris Accord and get China to abide by what they agreed to\\n\\n[1:29:33] Trump: But that’ll cost you $1 trillion.\\n\\nFinal question\\n\\n[1:29:34] Welker: This is about leadership, gentlemen, and this first question does go to you, President Trump.. Imagine this is your Inauguration Day. What will you say in your a\", 'President Donald Trump’s decision to accept 15,000 refugees in 2020 only helps “bigots,” says Catherine Rampell, a pro-migration columnist at the Washington Post.\\n\\n“The only constituency helped by Trump’s latest cruelty are the bigots and knee-jerk nationalists crafting his policies,” she wrote, under the headline “Trump’s refugee ceiling is bad for everyone but bigots.”\\n\\nRampell’s jibe was dismissed by Ann Corcoran, founder of Refugee resettlement Watch, who says the federal importation of refugees expands American poverty, slows technological innovation, and fuels civic conflict. She responded:\\n\\nThere’s no sense trying to argue with [progresives] except to turn it back and say; ‘What about our own poor people? Why aren’t they interested in taking care of our poor Americans? Our homeless? Why are refugees and immigrants somehow cooler and more desirable to take care of than our own poor people? Have we run out of poor Americans to take care of?’ No, clearly, we have not run out of poor Americans.\\n\\nOn September 10, the Washington Post reported on poverty in high-immigration, low-wage Florida:\\n\\nAfter the power went out at the Star [hotel], Rose’s family spent the last of their savings on a week’s stay at the Magic Castle [hotel], where the rooms were going for $39 a night. The plan was to buy time until they could come up with a plan. Her stepfather had applied for a dishwashing job at Chili’s but didn’t get it. Rose was temporarily out of work, too. One of the employees on her shift at Taco Bell had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, and she couldn’t go back to work until she proved she was virus free. … Finally, in early September, Rose’s parents found a way out, at least for now. A Kissimmee-based real estate agent, who provides aid to motel families and had helped them in the past, paid $3,000 in deposits and application fees for an extended-stay suite in a run-down resort community. Their new landlord agreed to overlook the fact that Rose’s parents had poor credit and had just started new $9-an-hour fast food jobs.\\n\\nIn February 2020, Breitbart News reported an investor-funded study which showed that the exclusion of migrant labor would help raise wages for Floridians:\\n\\nThe biggest winners from the E-Verify bill would be the least paid, least educated workers in the economy, said the study by Rick Harper, an economist formerly at the University of West Florida. “Those are the most likely to be substituted by employers hiring new workers when there is some competition” from illegal workers, wrote Harper, who now works with Triumph Gulf Coast Inc. to invest public funds in Florida. The law would also help narrow the income gap between the least educated and better educated workers, said the FWD.us report. The current shortage of workers already “has reduced the size of the difference in wages paid to less-educated workers versus well-educated workers … by 6 to 9 percent,” Harper wrote.\\n\\nMany refugees work in retail stores or in hotels where labor can comprise 50 percent of costs. But they add chaotic diversity to already-damaged towns, even as they also nudge down national productivity.\\n\\nBefore Trump, the large inflow of cheap and compliant refugee labor also allowed meatpacking plants to minimize investment in labor-saving, wealth-producing machinery. But Trump’s curb on refugees pressured meatpacking companies to invest heavily in automation, according to the Wall Street Journal:\\n\\nAt Pilgrim’s Pride Corp., the second-biggest U.S. chicken processor and majority-owned by JBS, deboning machines now trail humans by only 1% to 1.5%, in terms of meat yield per chicken. “They are much closer to what the person can do than seven years ago,” Mr. Nogueira said. Technology and automation are part of the $1 billion in capital expenditures JBS USA has planned for 2020. “One day we will be there, but we are not there yet,” he said.\\n\\n“There’s no question they’ve been avoiding the automation that would make everything more efficient and cost-effective,” said Corcoran.\\n\\nThe accelerating shift toward automation caused by rising wages will reduce corporations’ continued use of stoop labor in the field, reduce disease threats to migrants and Americans, preserve family farms, transfer wealth back from the coasts to the heartland, and help Americans keep up with Chinese, Japanese, and Icelandic automation.\\n\\nA shift toward automation will also help the many Midwestern towns now dominated by cheap labor meatpacking plants, she said.\\n\\nMoreover, even a ramped-up importation of 100,000 refugees each year could only help a tiny share of refugees around the world, said Corcoran. The best way to help the most refugees is to spend U.S. resources in their own country, she said. “If f you want to take care of these poor people, go to where they live in the world.”\\n\\nJoe Biden is promising to spike refugee inflows above 100,000 per year.\\n\\nAdvocates for migration are eager to claim moral superiority over the Americans who want to help Americans, said Corcoran. “They believe we’re bigots — that’s what they’ve been saying for decades — but they know big business uses these refugees to keep wages low,” she said.\\n\\nRampell’s claim of moral superiority is wrapped up in her establishment claim about America as a “Nation of Immigrants.” She wrote:\\n\\nThe United States has taken in those huddled masses yearning to breathe free because, first and foremost, doing so reflects American values. We like to consider our nation a city upon a hill for those fleeing religious persecution, political violence, genocide, tyranny; Americans are a people blessed and generous enough to offer refuge to some of the world’s most vulnerable. Just what this country offered so many generations of immigrants before, including many of our own ancestors.\\n\\nIn reality, numerous polls show that Americans really prefer that jobs and wages to first go to fellow Americans before the jobs got to additional migrants. For most Americans and immigrants, America is a nation of Americans.\\n\\nSo the hidden agenda for Rampell and many others progressives is political ambition, not charity, Corcoran said. “The bottom line is that these immigrants vote for Democrats,” she said.\\n\\n“Big business gets the cheap labor, the Democrats get the voters, and Americans get hammered with this humanitarian [B.S.],” she said.', 'With the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, President Trump will have the rare chance to appoint a third justice to the highest court in the country.\\n\\nHaving remained on her seat for just over 27 years, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the 24th longest-serving Supreme Court justice of the 114 to hold the office. While the longest-serving justice was William O. Douglas’ 36 years, 209 days span – lasting through the 40s, 50s, and 60s - the average term of service is 16 years, 359 days.\\n\\nAs the standard of health care continues to improve, a justice can potentially look forward to a longer tenure. To get an idea of how long that tenure might last, here is a rundown of the current justices and just how long each of them has served so far.\\n\\nCLARENCE THOMAS, 72\\n\\nNominated by President George H.W. Bush, Justice Clarence Thomas is the longest-serving member currently sitting on the bench. Even before Ginsburg’s death, Thomas was the longest-serving member with a tenure of 28 years, 332 days, having been confirmed on October 15th, 1991. His confirmation took 99 days, which happens to also be the longest time to confirm a justice.\\n\\nThomas is perhaps the most right-leaning justice on the court, according to an analysis by political scientists Lee Epstein, Andrew D. Martin and Kevin Quinn. Prior to the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Thomas had gone a full decade without asking any questions, a rare record since no justice for 45 years prior had gone a single term without asking questions during cases, according to the New York Times.\\n\\nSTEPHEN G. BREYER, 82\\n\\nNominated by President Bill Clinton, Justice Stephen G. Breyer’s term is just a bit shorter than that of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was also appointed by Clinton during his first term. Breyer has served for 26 years, 47 days so far, having been confirmed on July 29, 1994, with his confirmation taking 73 days to complete.\\n\\nWith Ginsburg’s passing, Breyer is now the oldest justice on the bench at 82-years-old-- a full decade older than Thomas. Breyer is a left-leaning justice, though more moderate than the other liberal justices. Breyer is also a more philosophical justice, having published a book, Active Liberty, in 2005 which attempted to lay out a systematic explanation of his approach to legal theory.\\n\\nSAMUEL ALITO, 70\\n\\nThe first appointee by President George W. Bush has enjoyed a tenure just a few months longer than that of his junior – and chief justice – John Roberts. Samuel Alito was appointed on January 31, 2006 after a process lasting 82 days. He is only a little younger than Clarence Thomas, but has served for only half as long as the longest-serving member on the bench.\\n\\nAlito is more conservative than the chief justice, but he is still considered more moderate than his fellow conservative-leaning justices. He considers himself a “practical originalist\" -- meaning he believes that the constitution’s fundamental meaning does not change. His actual practice, though, gives more emphasis to the “practical” use of the laws that the court reviews. He does, however, vote more often than not for a conservative interpretation, per analysis by 538.\\n\\nJOHN ROBERTS, 65\\n\\nCurrent Chief Justice John Roberts, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, has served just 134 days longer than that of the other Bush appointee, Justice Alito. Confirmed on Sept. 29, 2005, Roberts has served for 14 years, 356 days, with his confirmation taking 62 days to complete.\\n\\nRoberts’ confirmation was an unusual one, as Bush initially nominated Roberts to replace Associate Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, but then withdrew the nomination following the death of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. Bush then nominated Roberts for Chief Justice, a position held by only 16 people before him. The majority of chief justices are directly nominated, with only five having previously served as associate justices.\\n\\nRoberts is considered a moderate, despite being originally appointed under the assumption that he would be a more conservative justice. Roberts occasionally sides with more liberal justices, such as earlier in 2020 when he voted to preserve Obama-era protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children. Roberts has expressed a view for judicial restraint to support legal legitimacy of the court as a prime motivator for his decision-making and interpretation.\\n\\nSONIA SOTOMAYOR, 66\\n\\nAppointed by President Barack Obama at the start of his first term, Sotomayor was confirmed on Aug. 6, 2009 after a 66-day process. Sotomayor is the first - and so far only – Hispanic appointment to the Supreme Court. Her ascent was aided by both sides of the aisle, with President George H.W. Bush first appointing her to the Southern District of New York before President Bill Clinton elevated her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\\n\\nSotomayor also now holds the distinction as the most left-leaning justice on the Supreme Court. Her 11-year tenure has seen her voting in near-lockstep with Ginsburg. She has been cited as a “legal realist,” a position best summed up as believing that “the life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience.\"\\n\\nELENA KAGAN, 60\\n\\nThe second Obama appointee arrived a little over a year later. Elena Kagan was confirmed on August 5, 2010, following a rather lengthy process of 87 days. Her tenure has lasted just over a decade now, but that still leaves her as the third-most junior member on the bench.\\n\\nKagan appears to vote only a little more left-leaning than Breyer. Kagan served as Associate White House Counsel for President Bill Clinton, working on such cases as the Whitewater controversy. In 1997, she co-authored a plea for Clinton to support a ban on late-term abortions as part of a political compromise.\\n\\nNEIL GORSUCH, 53\\n\\nThe first appointment by President Trump saw Neil Gorsuch fill a vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. While Scalia died during the last year of Obama’s presidency, the Senate held off on hearing appointments until Trump took office.\\n\\nOnce the process started, it took 65 days to confirm Gorsuch on April 7, 2017, starting a tenure that has lasted three years, 162 days. Gorsuch also holds the distinction of being the first justice to serve alongside a justice for whom he has clerked – Justice Anthony Kennedy. He is currently the youngest justice on the bench.\\n\\nGorsuch has been a more conservative voice on the bench, falling in the middle of the right-leaning pack. He has at times voted more liberally, but he supports textualism and originalism when interpreting the constitution.\\n\\nBRETT KAVANAUGH, 55\\n\\nWhile his tenure is currently the shortest, Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation process was the second-longest of the current justices. Appointed in 2018, his confirmation hearing lasted for 88 days before he was appointed on October 6, 2018. He is the second appointee by President Trump.\\n\\nKavanaugh quickly established himself as one of the most conservative justices on the bench, second only to Thomas. Despite his overall record, he has taken a few surprise positions, such as voting in favor of the Manhattan District Attorney gaining access to Trump’s tax records. His record at times indicates an emphasis on the distinction between rulings that should be within the court’s purview versus that of Congress.', 'ANNAPOLIS, Md. — Maryland\\'s Republican Gov. Larry Hogan wrote-in former President Ronald Reagan on the ballot he mailed in last week rather than vote for either President Donald Trump or his Democratic challenger Joe Biden.\\n\\nThe news, which was first reported Friday by The Washington Post, was confirmed on Twitter later that day by Hogan\\'s communications director Mike Ricci.\\n\\n\"I know it’s simply symbolic. It’s not going to change the outcome in my state. But I thought it was important to just cast a vote that showed the kind of person I’d like to see in office,\" Hogan told the Post.\\n\\nHogan, a fierce critic of the president, did not vote for Trump in 2016 either, writing in his father, Larry Hogan, Sr., instead of voting for Trump or Hillary Clinton that year. Hogan told the Post he considered Reagan \"my hero in politics\" along with his father, Larry Hogan Sr., a three-term Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives.\\n\\nGOP defectors:Here are the prominent Republicans not supporting Trump, and those who are supporting Biden\\n\\nHogan, who is nearing the end of his second and final term, broke with Trump on a number of issues after he became president, including immigration, and he considered a primary challenge against the president before ruling against it in June 2019.\\n\\nThe Maryland governor has been especially vocal in his condemnation of Trump\\'s response to the coronavirus pandemic, at one point purchasing 500,000 COVID-19 test kits directly from South Korea because he felt the federal government had left the governors to fend for themselves.\\n\\nOther sitting Republican governors who said they will not vote for Trump include Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker and Vermont Gov. Phil Scott.', \"As we head toward the first presidential debate on Tuesday, two things are true. The U.S. economy, as measured by gross domestic product, is in decline. The second thing is that, as proven by the latest Latino Donor Collaborative U.S. Latino GDP Report, the world’s leading growth economy is right here in America. Now the question is, will Joe Biden or President Donald Trump leverage this advantage?\\n\\nEven before the coronavirus struck, the economy was in trouble. Workforce growth rate has been in decline; small businesses continue to struggle, the number of people employed in manufacturing has declined; family farm bankruptcies are at an eight-year high; real wages for American workers have barely budged; and we’re even losing in the trade war as China’s trade surplus with the U.S. has grown almost 25 percent since Trump became president.\\n\\nAs we look ahead, we need to talk about how to catalyze our economy and return to the growth we have experienced in the past.\\n\\nIn contrast, some of our strongest GDP growth occurred during the Reagan years. President Ronald Reagan understood the value of encouraging investment in areas of growth and welcoming immigrants to supplement our existing workforce so we could increase goods and services production while creating more jobs. During President Bill Clinton's administration, GDP growth was even higher. Trump was not on track to match either president, even before Covid-19 hit.\\n\\nSo as we look ahead, we need to talk about how to catalyze our economy and return to the growth we have experienced in the past. How do we do that? By leveraging the cohort that is growing dramatically faster than all others, creating new businesses at a faster pace, employing millions of Americans, supplying the most productive labor force and leading consumption. That is the U.S. Latino cohort, which has become, right here within our own country, a world-leading economy.\\n\\nThe new Latino Donor Collaborative U.S. Latino GDP Report shows the U.S. Latino cohort is already equivalent to the eighth largest economy in the world. In fact, according to the report, U.S. Latino GDP is now at $2.6 trillion, an 8.7 percent growth rate from 2017 to 2018. That’s a growth rate outpacing India and China. Given its trajectory, U.S. Latino GDP is poised to surpass France, the U.K. and India — possibly within the next five years.\\n\\nThis unprecedented economic growth train left the station back in 2005 and has been gaining speed ever since. More and more U.S. Latinos are becoming old enough to work each year, adding to the millions already working, plus workers from previous generations are moving into higher-income roles. Meanwhile, the education rate is dramatically increasing every year, incomes are growing and driving consumption and the result is consistent GDP growth.\\n\\nThe good news is the economic momentum of the U.S. Latino cohort has so far been able to overcome the headwinds it has faced from anti-immigration policies and anti-Latino rhetoric. Making this growth even more remarkable is that the U.S. Latino cohort is one of the most under-capitalized cohorts in our country, and therein lies our unparalleled opportunity.\\n\\nAsset management firms, CEOs, corporate boards, nonprofits, everyone responsible for managing assets for returns, investing assets for returns and allocating resources for returns should begin deploying their capital where the growth is in our economy: the U.S. Latino cohort. This is our nation’s differentiating competitive advantage versus other large, aging economies. It is illogical to not be investing in this cohort that is catalyzing growth in every part of our economy, whether they are our essential workers, entrepreneurs, business owners or professionals. They are enabling our competitiveness, providing health care, expanding our culture and improving the quality of life for all Americans in our country.\\n\\nAs a capitalist, it is imperative, in my opinion, that capitalism in our country move now from working for just “the few” to working for “the many.” That means making certain the U.S. Latino cohort is catalyzed even further through access and connections to capital, especially getting money into the hands of Latino-owned small businesses and entrepreneurs, as well as the hands of U.S. Latino-founded funds so they can grow and invest more knowledgeably in this cohort, while at the same time making certain that U.S. Latinos are active in the most senior positions on boards of directors and in C-suites.\\n\\nWhile U.S. Latinos make up nearly 20 percent of our population, they make up only around 4 percent of this country’s executive ranks, and less than 3 percent of directors on Fortune 500 boards are Latino. A logical growth strategy for our country, in addition to increasing capital flow, must include increasing the number of U.S. Latinos in boardrooms and executive offices to 15 percent within the next five years.\\n\\nAn axiom in business is that leadership in boards must understand their customers and the markets they serve. Therefore, U.S. Latino representation on boards is key to understanding and serving this leading growth cohort. Leadership that understands its growing customer base is essential to catalyzing profitable growth, growing employee wages and increasing shareholder return.\\n\\nAs a capitalist, it is imperative, in my opinion, that capitalism in our country move now from working for just “the few” to working for “the many.”\\n\\nThe additional return on investing in this cohort should also be clear to the millions of baby boomers who are leaving the workforce yearly, and the Gen X folks following them, because it is this U.S. Latino cohort that will have the largest responsibility for paying taxes that sustain the Social Security and Medicare programs retirees are counting on.\\n\\nWhen capital flows to where the growth is, wealth creation occurs. The more people creating wealth, the greater the growth of an economy. That’s how capitalism works in an economy, and by broadening the flow of capital to the U.S. Latino cohort and engaging U.S. Latinos at the highest levels, we as a country can catalyze the world-leading growth of this cohort even further, expanding our competitive advantage and attracting investors worldwide.\\n\\nLike so many U.S. Latinos, my family roots in this country go back 500 years, well before the Mayflower landed. So this month, when I see celebrations of Hispanic Heritage Month, I personally am celebrating the United States of America, and with the latest facts and data about what the U.S. Latino cohort means for my country, this is a celebration and opportunity from which all Americans should find enjoyment and benefit.\", 'We\\'re told that Joe Biden is our president-elect and he will shuffle into the White House in January with something called a \"mandate.\" If that\\'s true, what exactly is he going to do with this mandate?\\n\\nThat\\'s an interesting question, but almost no one is asking it. Instead, our news media is busy swarming Rudy Giuliani, a former mayor who hasn\\'t held public office in decades, because he has questions about some of the voting that took place last week. Therefore, he\\'s an imminent threat to the republic requiring blanket coverage.\\n\\nBut whatever you do, do not cover the guy that you claim is president. The Biden people are fine with this, by the way. They don\\'t want to deal with the media either, so they\\'re not. On Tuesday, Ryan Lizza of Politico noticed \"[D]iscouraging signs about the Biden team and press access so far.\\n\\n\"[N]o regular transition briefings, no readout of calls with foreign leaders ... no open press access to the candidate and his people,\" Lizza wrote. \"This is a break with tradition.\"\\n\\nOf course, it is a break with tradition and it\\'s worrisome, but you\\'re not allowed to notice it. Biden supporters immediately screamed at Ryan Lizza to shut up. So what exactly is going on behind this news blackout veiling Joe Biden from public view? Well, pretty much exactly what you expect: They are busy rewarding the forces of repression that made these election results possible.\\n\\nGuess who\\'s first in line? You guessed it, the tech monopolies. They did their job. They shutdown one side, protected the other. And now it\\'s time for the reward. In one of his first acts as president elect, Joe Biden named a man called Ron Klain to be his chief of staff. Now, Klain worked for Biden before and is a close ally. That\\'s the story that you\\'ve read about why he got the job.\\n\\nBut that\\'s not why he got the job. Ron Klain is also a lobbyist for Big Tech. Four years ago, he joined the executive council of Silicon Valley\\'s lobbying arm in Washington. Ron Klain was not chosen for his success as a public servant. We know that because last year, he acknowledged that the Obama administration, where he was a senior official, totally mishandled the swine flu pandemic, the one that came before this one.\\n\\nFLASHBACK: BIDEN\\'S CHIEF OF STAFF PICK ADMITS OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID EVERYTHING WRONG WITH H1N1\\n\\n\"It’s just purely a fortuity that this isn’t one of the great mass casualty events in American history, Ron Klain conceded with admirable bluntness. \"It had nothing to do with us doing anything right, it just had to do with luck.”\\n\\nWhat\\'s amazing is that despite uttering the above quote, somehow Ron Klain managed to become Joe Biden\\'s advisor on the coronaviruses pandemic. And from the first day, he got that wrong, too. Here\\'s Klain in late January, explaining that President Trump\\'s ban on travel from China, where the virus came from, was a very bad idea.\\n\\nQUESTION: Would you ban Chinese travelers from arriving in the United States?\\n\\nKLAIN: I wouldn\\'t. I think that\\'s premature. I think it\\'s [a] very important exchange, very important for trade and tourism.\\n\\nThat is to say, Silicon Valley\\'s bottom line means you can\\'t annoy or inconvenience China. And then Klain kept going. On Feb. 28, he tweeted this: \"On #COVID-19: If you want to do something useful today, go to Chinatown -- buy a meal, go shopping. The virus attacks humans, not people of any ethnicity/race. Fear is hurting Chinese-American owned businesses, baselessly. Let\\'s fight the disease AND let\\'s fight prejudice.\"\\n\\nKeep in mind, at the moment Klain wrote that, there were no attacks against Chinese-Americans because of the coronavirus, because the U.S. is a deeply decent, non-racist country.

The CCP refers to the camps as “vocational training centers” meant to educate prisoners, but survivors say they endured or witnessed extreme torture, indoctrination, rape, forced sterilization, and other crimes against humanity.\\n\\nThe culture of Xinjiang’s native minorities differs greatly from that of China’s ruling ethnic Han majority. Uyghurs, Kyrgyz, and Kazakhs are majority Sunni Muslim and speak Turkic languages. The CCP views Xinjiang’s cultural differences as a threat to the party’s dominant power, which is consolidated within the ethnic Han culture. The party has resorted to extreme measures to assimilate Xinjiang’s minorities into Han culture through its detention camp system. Survivors of the camps say they were subjected to Communist Party political indoctrination, forced into slave labor, and endured physical and sexual abuse, among other human rights abuses.\\n\\nXinjiang’s Turkic ethnic groups are not the only minorities targeted by CCP discrimination. Human rights watchers have accused the Communist Party of racist attitudes and actions against African immigrants in China as well.

We may receive a commission through The Points Guy affiliate network if you apply and are approved for a card, but our reporting is always independent and objective.\\n\\nWith travel slowly starting to get back on its feet and people thinking about their next vacation — even if it’s not for another year from now — the brand-new sign-up offers on the two IHG hotel credit cards might be just what you’re looking for if you want to earn a ton of points to use toward that trip you’re daydreaming about.\\n\\nThe IHG Rewards Club Premier Credit Card is currently offering a whopping 140,000 bonus points after spending $3,000 on the card within the first three months of account opening, while the no-annual-fee IHG Rewards Club Traveler Credit Card is offering 100,000 bonus points after spending just $2,000 on the card within the same time frame.\\n\\nAlthough the IHG Premier card comes with an $89 annual fee, the fee is waived for the first year, which makes this our recommended card between the two options — as long as you can meet the higher $3,000 minimum spending requirement. Not only will you earn more points from the welcome offer, you’ll also get many more benefits, making the card much more desirable.\\n\\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the hotel properties that fall within the IHG umbrella, they include brands such as Holiday Inn, Hotel Indigo, Kimpton, Crowne Plaza and high-end InterContinental Hotels. And with the IHG Premier card, you’ll earn up to a whopping 25 points in total for every dollar you spend at these and other IHG hotels, along with 2 points per dollar on purchases at gas stations, grocery stores and restaurants and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the no-annual-fee IHG Traveler card earns up to 15 points in total for every dollar spent at IHG properties, and the same number of points as the IHG Premier Card in all the other categories.\\n\\nWhile the number of points you’ll earn for your IHG stays with either of these two cards is better than any other credit card out there, you can probably get more rewards in the other bonus categories and on everyday purchases with a different card. But the real value of these cards comes down to their benefits, so let’s take a look at how either card can work for IHG loyalists.\\n\\nBenefits of the IHG credit cards\\n\\nElite status at IHG properties\\n\\nIHG Premier credit card holders automatically receive complimentary IHG Platinum elite status. Although IHG Platinum status isn’t the best hotel status around, having some sort of elite status when you walk in the front door of a hotel is better than no status at all.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of holding IHG Platinum status — or any IHG status — is that your points will never expire. Typically, IHG points expire if there’s no account activity within a 12-month time frame. IHG is very strict with this policy, so not having to worry about your points expiring is a great benefit.\\n\\nThe IHG Traveler card, on the other hand, will only earn you Gold elite status if you spend $10,000 per calendar year on the card. Truthfully, we don’t recommend spending this amount of money on the card solely for this benefit.\\n\\nA reward night every year with the IHG Premier\\n\\nStarting with your first IHG Premier card anniversary (meaning one year from the date you originally get the card), every year you’ll receive a reward night certificate to redeem at a qualifying IHG hotel. Now, this certificate can’t be used at every IHG property — it’s capped at hotels costing up to 40,000 IHG Rewards points. But IHG has recently moved to variable pricing for its awards, so depending on when you travel, you might be able to use these certificates at some very high-end properties.\\n\\nEven under the old IHG chart, some notable properties where this certificate can be redeemed include the InterContinental Hotel Lisbon, the InterContinental Fiji Golf Resort & Spa, the Holiday Inn Resort Aruba and the Hotel Indigo San Diego Del Mar, just to name a few. During peak dates, these hotels can be quite pricey if you’re paying for them in cash, giving you excellent value with this perk.\\n\\nWith the certificate alone, you’re already coming out well ahead of the annual fee. And if your significant other also has an IHG Premier card, you can put the certificates from both cards together to get a nice weekend getaway by booking the reward nights back to back.\\n\\nJust know that this is a benefit that only comes with the IHG Premier card, not the IHG Traveler card. So even after the first year, you might find paying the extra $89 is well worth it solely for the reward night certificate.\\n\\nA complimentary fourth night with either card\\n\\nThe Holiday Inn Resort Aruba-Beach. PHOTO: IHG Hotels\\n\\nAll card holders of both the IHG Premier credit card and the IHG Traveler credit card get a complimentary fourth night when redeeming points at an IHG hotel. There are no exclusions to this benefit — this perk can be extended to any IHG property, regardless of the number of points it costs.\\n\\nFor example, let’s say you’re looking to stay at the Holiday Inn Resort Aruba right near Palm Beach in Aruba at a cost of 40,000 points per night. Thanks to this benefit, you can redeem just 120,000 points for a full four-night stay at this hotel. That means with the card’s sign-up bonus alone, you can be well on your way to enjoying the sunny Caribbean for no additional cost.\\n\\nGlobal Entry or TSA PreCheck fee credit with the IHG Premier\\n\\nWhen you apply for either the Global Entry or TSA PreCheck trusted traveler programs, just pay with your IHG Premier credit card and your application fee up to $100 will be reimbursed in full. The TSA PreCheck program gets you through TSA security faster at US airports, while Global Entry expedites going through immigration when you return to the US from being overseas.\\n\\nEven if you already have one of these memberships, you can always use your IHG Premier to pay for a friend or family member’s application fee and you’ll still receive the reimbursement — the name on the Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application doesn’t need to match the name on the credit card. And you can receive this fee reimbursement once every four years.\\n\\nThis isn’t a perk that comes with the IHG Traveler card, which is another reason why the benefits of the IHG Premier card outweigh the annual fee difference.\\n\\nCell phone protection with both cards\\n\\nIf you pay for your cell phone bill with either your IHG Premier or IHG Traveler card, you’ll automatically be covered in case your cell phone is stolen or damaged. This is an extremely valuable perk, and one that isn’t too common yet among reward credit cards — especially a card that comes with no annual fee, such as the IHG Traveler.\\n\\nWith the IHG Premier, you can be reimbursed up to $800 per claim, while the IHG Traveler will reimburse you up to $600 per claim. Both cards are capped at $1,000 in reimbursements per year and a maximum of two claims in a rolling 12-month period. With both cards, you’ll also be charged a $50 deductible per claim.\\n\\nShould you consider the IHG credit cards?\\n\\nIf you stay at IHG hotels even a couple times a year, we recommend either the IHG Premier or the IHG Traveler for their benefits, but not for using on everyday purchases. That’s because you can earn more rewards — either cash back or points — with other credit cards.\\n\\nFor example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card earns 2 points for every dollar you spend on travel and dining, but Chase points are worth at least twice as much as IHG points. Even on CNN Underscored’s benchmark credit card, the Citi® Double Cash Card, you’ll earn 2% cash back — 1% when you make a purchase, and another 1% when you pay it off — on everything you buy. Since IHG points are only worth 0.5 cents apiece, according to The Points Guy, you’re getting a 12.5% return on spending at IHG hotels with the IHG Premier card but only a 1% return in the 2x bonus categories.\\n\\nIf you’re trying to determine which card to apply for, we recommend the IHG Premier card over the IHG Traveler card for most travelers. Since the IHG Premier waives its annual fee for the first year, you’re essentially earning an extra 40,000 bonus points from its higher sign-up offer without paying anything extra in year one. With IHG points worth 0.5 cents apiece, that’s another $200 toward IHG hotels, plus you’re getting all the enhanced benefits for 12 months.\\n\\nAnd after the first year, if you decide you don’t want to pay an annual fee for the card, you can always downgrade to the IHG Traveler and skip the annual fee going forward.\\n\\nNow, if you don’t spend a lot of time at IHG hotels, these probably aren’t the right credit cards for you, since you won’t be able to take advantage of the best benefits and perks of either of them. If that’s the case, check our our guide to the best credit cards of 2020 to find a card that’s more suitable for your needs.\\n\\nApply now to maximize the sign-up bonus\\n\\nA room at the IHG InterContinental Hotel in Lisbon. PHOTO: IHG Hotels\\n\\nWith some other credit cards, you’ll find that the value mostly comes from the sign-up offer. But not these cards. The IHG credit cards are ones you’ll likely want to hold on to for years to come thanks to their benefits — even for the occasional IHG traveler.\\n\\nIn the first year alone, with the IHG Premier card, you’ll end up with 140,000 bonus points after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first three months of account opening — valued at $700 according to The Points Guy — plus a Global Entry or TSA PreCheck reimbursement, which is worth up to another $100.\\n\\nAnd starting with the second year, you’ll receive a reward night certificate valued at up to $200 since the certificate works at IHG properties that cost up to 40,000 points per night. Add in all of the other benefits of being a card holder — such as your complimentary fourth night and Platinum elite status — and for just an $89 fee, you should find it very easy to come out ahead if you use IHG hotels on any regular basis.\\n\\nFinally, those who have the old IHG Rewards Club Select Card (which is no longer available to new applicants) aren’t disqualified from getting the IHG Premier card and bonus offer. And if you have both cards, you’re able to reap the benefits of both at the same time and get even greater value from being a card holder. Just keep in mind that since this is a Chase credit card, all applicants are subject to Chase’s “5/24” rule, which means if you’ve gotten five or more credit cards from all banks in the past 24 months, Chase will automatically deny your application.\\n\\nSo if you’ve been considering either of these cards, grab them now with the highest offer we’ve seen to date and score a sweet haul of bonus points to use at IHG hotels around the world — either in the near future or down the line.\\n\\nLearn more about the IHG Rewards Club Premier Credit Card.\\n\\nLearn more about the IHG Rewards Club Traveler Credit Card.', 'The Trump administration on Tuesday said it is reimposing its \"public charge\" wealth test for green cards that had been blocked during the pandemic, a move likely to alarm advocates, who have warned about the policy\\'s impact on immigrant communities ravaged by the coronavirus.\\n\\nThe 2019 rule, which gives officials more power to deny permanent residency to applicants the government deems rely or could rely on public benefits like food stamps or housing vouchers, was blocked in late July by a federal judge who found it was hampering efforts to contain the virus.\\n\\nCiting declarations by doctors and local officials who said immigrants across the country feared they could jeopardize their immigration status by seeking medical treatment and government aid during the pandemic, Judge George Daniels blocked the policy\\'s implementation for the duration of the national coronavirus emergency.\\n\\nGet Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox\\n\\nHowever, subsequent orders by the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, including one earlier this month, limited and ultimately suspended Daniels\\' ruling, allowing the Trump administration to again enforce the public charge test.\\n\\nIn updated guidance on its website on Tuesday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said it would apply the 2019 public charge test to all future and pending green card applications filed after February 24, 2020, when the agency implemented the rule following the Supreme Court\\'s green light. Applications filed after Daniels\\' injunction in July that have been approved will not be re-adjudicated, USCIS said.\\n\\nThe \"public charge\" standard was first included in U.S. law in the early 1880s, when the U.S. government began to restrict and regulate immigration at the federal level, including by banning Chinese immigrants under the premise that they \"endangered the good order\" of certain American communities. The term \"public charge\" essentially means being an economic burden on the country.\\n\\nWhile the test was used for decades to prohibit the entry of certain low-income immigrants and, in some cases, to deport them, its definition was expanded by the Trump administration\\'s 2019 rule, which superseded Clinton-era guidance that instructed officials to only deem immigrants public charges if they were receiving government cash benefits or long-term institutionalized care.\\n\\nThe 2019 rule broadened the type and amount of benefits that count against immigrants seeking to stay in or move to the U.S., requiring immigration caseworkers to consider enrollment in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), certain federally funded Medicaid benefits, and a variety of forms of government-subsidized housing, including Section 8 vouchers.\\n\\nAdvocates have strongly criticized the policy, pointing to research about the \"chilling effect\" it has had on immigrant households that fear the consequences of accessing government benefits, including those comprised of green card holders and U.S. citizens, who are not subject to the public charge test. The Trump administration, however, has argued the policy promotes self-sufficiency among immigrants.\\n\\n\"That expectation in our law that legal immigrants who are going to stay here long-term can stand on their own two feet is a very long-standing not just tradition, but it\\'s a long-standing legal requirement,\" Ken Cuccinelli, the second-in-command at the Department of Homeland Security, told CBS News in a recent interview. \"I can cite family history in my Italian family about people who were sponsors and making sure their sponsorees had jobs and those kinds of things. That\\'s what we expect.\"', 'China’s Ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu, warned the country on Thursday that, if Ottawa cares about the “health and safety” of Canadians, it will not extend a hand to help Hong Kong refugees fleeing a wave of communist repression.\\n\\nLeftist Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had warned China in remarks this week that Canada would not accept “coercive diplomacy” and that Ottawa would publicly condemn China for human rights abuses both in Hong Kong and in Xinjiang, a western province where evidence suggests the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has placed as many as 3 million people in concentration camps.\\n\\nIn Hong Kong, China unconstitutionally ended the region’s autonomy in May with a “national security” law that essentially outlawed criticism of the CCP there. CCP-controlled police have increasingly used the law to arrest pro-democracy dissidents for engaging in peaceful protests against China. At its peak, the anti-communist protests in the city attracted 2 million of Hong Kong’s 7 million people. Police have also hinted that they may use the law to prosecute hundreds of thousands of people for voting in pro-democracy party primaries this year.\\n\\nHong Kong’s Basic Law, its constitutional document, prohibits China from imposing any laws on it passed in Beijing. The current Hong Kong government has chosen to disregard this provision and enforce the “national security” law.\\n\\nCong, the ambassador to Ottawa, threatened Canadian citizens in remarks observing the anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries.\\n\\n“We strongly urge the Canadian side not to grant so-called political asylum to those violent criminals in Hong Kong, because it is interference in China’s domestic affairs, and certainly it will embolden those violent criminals,” Cong said, referring to peaceful anti-communist protesters.\\n\\n“If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong … you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,” he added.\\n\\nDespite Trudeau’s remarks, Canadian immigration services have yet to make a concrete declaration on the status of Hong Kong refugees. At least one couple did receive political asylum in Canada after fleeing Hong Kong; another 45 cases are reportedly pending.\\n\\nOn Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry declared Cong’s remarks “beyond reproach.”\\n\\n“The Chinese embassy in Canada just made clear our just position on issues relating to Hong Kong. It is beyond reproach. If anyone is misinterpreting this, then you should ask for the reason and find out if there are ulterior motives involved,” spokesman Zhao Lijian, who spread a conspiracy theory that the U.S. Army is responsible for the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, told reporters.\\n\\nCanadian officials responded with outrage to the threat (when asked, Cong did not deny that his remarks were a threat).\\n\\n“The reported comments by the Chinese ambassador are totally unacceptable and disturbing,” Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said in response. “I have instructed Global Affairs to call the Ambassador in to make clear in no uncertain terms that Canada will always stand up for human rights and the rights of Canadians around the world.”\\n\\nChampagne is embroiled in an ongoing scandal, erupting in June when Canadian media reported that he possessed two outstanding mortgages with the Bank of China, a state company. The reports surfaced after Champagne issued praise and thanks to China for sending the country faulty medical equipment for use to fight the Chinese coronavirus.\\n\\nTrudeau’s remarks on Tuesday against the Chinese government deviated significantly from his typical diplomacy. Like Cong’s, they were meant to mark the anniversary of Chinese-Canadian relations.\\n\\n“We will remain absolutely committed to working with our allies to ensure that China’s approach of coercive diplomacy, its arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens, alongside other citizens of other countries around the world, is not viewed as a successful tactic by them,” Trudeau said.\\n\\nThe prime minister was referring to the arbitrary arrests of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in China on dubious charges of “espionage.” The arrests closely followed Canada’s detention of Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. Meng is awaiting extradition to the United States over evidence that she actively violated sanctions on Iran. Chinese state media has been largely transparent about the true purpose of keeping Spavor and Kovrig behind bars, threatening Canada and urging it not to “sabotage” China.\\n\\nAmnesty International has verified that the two Canadians have endured “obvious violations to their rights to a fair trial,” rendering the legal process illegitimate.\\n\\nChina’s Foreign Ministry responded tersely to Trudeau’s statements on Tuesday.\\n\\n“We firmly deplore and oppose the Canadian side deliberately confusing right and wrong and once again making erroneous comments, and we have lodged stern representations,” spokesman Zhao Lijian said.\\n\\nZhao plainly stated that all tensions between China and Canada “are caused by Canada’s arbitrary detention of Meng Wanzhou, an innocent Chinese citizen who hasn’t breached any Canadian law.”\\n\\nThe spokesman then called Trudeau “hypocritical and weak” for condemning Chinese human rights atrocities.\\n\\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.', '\"TikTok Titas\" in the Silver State may have helped Joe Biden win gold in this year\\'s dramatic presidential election.\\n\\nOlder Filipina American women — known as \"titas\" — made a splash in Nevada in get-out-the-vote moments during the campaign, from vibrant car parades to popular TikTok clips. They\\'re just one of a variety of Asian American and Pacific Islander groups that came out enthusiastically for Biden\\'s campaign even amid the stress and unusual circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic, said Christian Bato, the Biden campaign\\'s lead for AAPI outreach in Nevada.\\n\\nWith 98 percent of the expected vote reported, Biden had won just over 50 percent in Nevada to 47.5 percent for President Donald Trump. The difference was less than 37,000 votes.\\n\\nAccording to Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote, or APIAVote, a nonpartisan civic engagement group, there were more than 209,000 eligible AAPI voters in Nevada going into the election, about 11 percent of the state\\'s electorate.\\n\\nAsian Americans are the fastest-growing ethnic group in the U.S. And according to the 2010 census, it is in Nevada that their numbers have been increasing the fastest.\\n\\nExit polling indicated that 58 percent of Asian American voters in Nevada supported Biden and 40 percent chose Trump.\\n\\n\"Even though Asian American voters can be a smaller segment of the electorate — which they usually are — when they show strong support for one candidate in a very close race, they could actually make the difference,\" said Jerry Vattamala, director of the Democracy Program for the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, or AALDEF. \"I think we saw that [in] Nevada and a few other states where [you had] these razor-thin margins.\"\\n\\nJust under half the people questioned in AALDEF\\'s separate exit poll of early voters in Clark County, which includes the state\\'s AAPI center, Las Vegas, identified as Filipino American. Among those Filipino Americans, 56 percent supported Biden, while 44 percent backed Trump. Biden did better among those of self-identified Chinese descent, AALDEF found, winning 64 percent of the early vote to Trump\\'s 29 percent, and Biden was even more successful among people of Korean and Indian heritage.\\n\\nAmong first-time AAPIs who voted early in Clark County, 63 percent chose Biden and 37 percent chose Trump, Vattamala said.

Vattamala said past surveys have shown that foreign-born voters and those who have limited proficiency in English — \"the very people [Trump] was trying to keep out of the country,\" as he put it — were more inclined to support Trump.\\n\\nIn Nevada, other data gathered by AALDEF suggest how AAPI voters — at least those who went to the polls early — may have been inclined to trend toward Biden.\\n\\nFor example, about 55 percent said they disapproved or strongly disapproved of the job Trump is doing as president, Vattamala said. Around 70 percent of those surveyed said they supported or strongly supported a woman\\'s right to an abortion as established by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade. Overwhelming majorities said they support laws protecting gay and transgender people from discrimination in housing and public accommodation and want to see comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship for the undocumented.\\n\\nBato, of the Biden campaign, said Asian American voters in the state were highly motivated \"given the circumstances of everything — Covid-19, President Trump\\'s rhetoric specifically targeting the Asian American community\" and the presence of Sen. Kamala Harris, who is of both Black and Indian descent, on the ticket. The campaign drew enthusiasm from a variety of groups even with the stress and the unusual circumstances of the pandemic, he said.\\n\\n\"There was a lot of energy and momentum that we helped assist, but it really came from the community. They were very excited to have their voice heard, to reject some of that vitriol and the rhetoric that was targeted towards our community and to really uplift and elect the first Black, Asian American woman to hold the second-highest office in the land,\" he said.\\n\\n\"They knew how important it was, but they wanted to have fun with it, especially during the pandemic time, and they were able to use that same sort of grit and hard work that they\\'ve had for decades of organizing this community and adapting to these times, [including] through digital media,\" he said.\\n\\nIt is often — and accurately — said, however, that AAPI voters are not a monolith.\\n\\nIn Nevada, observers say, Filipino Americans illustrate the complexity of — and the need for nuance in — voter outreach efforts. Vattamala said they have a high interest in and engagement with health care, including in occupations like nursing and hospital work, which may have put them on the front lines during the pandemic, in addition to the possibility of having experienced anti-AAPI racism associated with the virus. Among other things, the Filipino community is also noted for strong religious faith, particularly Catholicism.\\n\\nEric Jeng, deputy director of the grassroots nonprofit One APIA Nevada, said that based on polling and focus group conversations, his sense is that when AAPI voters consider political candidates, \"home-country politics do still play a big part\" that can vary by ethnic group.\\n\\nJeng said that in the Vietnamese and Taiwanese communities, for example, he gauged more enthusiasm for Trump based on their perceptions of his Asia policies. Simultaneously, however, \"the anti-AAPI racism that the president stoked\" motivated other Asian American voters to reject Trump, he said. The use of phrases like \"\\'kung flu\\' or \\'China virus\\' doesn\\'t help,\" he said.\\n\\nWhile campaigns have made some strides in connecting with AAPI voters and enlisting people within communities to talk to their families, friends, neighbors and business colleagues, there\\'s still a lot to be done. Groups like APIAVote continue to report that large parts of the Asian American community, despite its rapid growth, have been left out of political outreach by both the Democratic and Republican parties for cycle after cycle.\\n\\nThose working within the AAPI community to foster political engagement and influence have their own goals. \"I think one thing we want to shift from is kind of like the transactional electoral model to [asking] long term, \\'What does it mean to build power within the community?\\'\" Jeng said.\\n\\nVattamala also sounded a note of warning about looking at trends and reaching conclusions about AAPI voters in Nevada and nationally.\\n\\nThe pandemic presented considerable challenges to data collection in direct contact with voters, and millions ended up voting by mail and therefore were not interviewed by groups like AALDEF in the same numbers as in the past.\\n\\nIn addition, he said, exit polls could have been affected by variations by party in how likely people, including AAPIs, were to vote in person — either early or on Election Day — compared to voting by mail.\\n\\nThat having been said, Vattamala warned that some analysts could try to compare 2020 exit polls with exit polls from 2016 and conclude, \"Oh, it looks like Trump made a lot of inroads.\"\\n\\n\"That seems to be the narrative now, [that] more people of color were starting to vote for Trump, support Trump, than in the past,\" he said. \"And I would just say I would take that with a grain of salt and be a little cautious.\"', 'In 2018, a reporter asked him if he felt he deserved it. “Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it,” he responded.\\n\\n“I’m going to get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things — if they gave it out fairly, which they don’t,” Trump said in 2019.\\n\\n“Nobel Peace, can you imagine?” he asked in September — the same month he retweeted at least 12 different messages from supporters on the topic.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump’s unofficial, unorthodox quest for the prize has benefited from the help of far-flung foreign allies — including an anti-immigrant Norwegian politician and an Australian law professor best known for pro-monarchy campaigns — who ensure that he is nominated time and again.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEven prominent world leaders, including South Korea’s Moon Jae-in, Britain’s Boris Johnson and former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, have found themselves dragged into the effort.\\n\\nThis year, the White House itself released an official statement to announce that Trump had been nominated for the 2021 prize. The World Food Program was awarded the 2020 prize on Friday.\\n\\nSo far, Trump’s campaign for recognition in Oslo has earned him plenty of headlines, but borne no other fruit.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNobel trackers argue that the campaign of Trump and his supporters is doing him no favors. “Trump is so despised outside the U.S. that I cannot imagine the committee will spend any time on him at all,” Fredrik Heffermehl, a Norwegian peace activist, wrote in an email Thursday.\\n\\nThe U.S. presidents who have won the prize — Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama — did not make similar lobbying statements or seek the prize publicly, historians say.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRoosevelt’s nomination had been sponsored by “several American academics and several European diplomats for his efforts in mediating the end to the Russo-Japanese War,” said Stanley Wein, author of “Ambassador for Peace: How Theodore Roosevelt Won the Nobel Peace Prize.\"\\n\\nTrump’s history of nominations\\n\\nUnlike most other awards, the Nobel Peace Prize has a remarkably open system for nominations: Among the list of people who can nominate a person or group for a prize are university professors and national lawmakers. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was nominated in 1939.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee say that there were 318 candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020, of which 211 are individuals and 107 are organizations. It is not clear whether Trump was nominated this year — the deadline for nominations was Jan. 31 and the committee keeps nominees’ names secret for 50 years.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump’s initial entry into the nominations appears to have been unusual. Ahead of the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that the new U.S. president had been nominated twice, but the nominations were withdrawn after officials said they were fakes.\\n\\nTrump was subsequently nominated multiple times for the prize in 2019 because of his negotiations with North Korea, according to public statements from those who nominated him. Among those who announced they had nominated him were Christian Tybring-Gjedde and Per-Willy Amundsen, two Norwegian lawmakers with the populist, anti-immigration Progress Party, and a group of 18 Republican lawmakers from the United States.\\n\\nNot everyone who nominated Trump may have admitted it. In February 2019, Trump told reporters that Abe, then Japan’s prime minister, had given him “the most beautiful copy” of a letter nominating him for the prize. Abe, who sought a close relationship with Trump before retiring this year, never denied the account, instead telling lawmakers that he was “not saying it’s not true.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMoon suggested Trump should win the Nobel for talks with North Korea, though it is not clear whether the South Korean president nominated him, while Johnson, the British prime minister, suggested in 2018 that Trump would deserve a prize if he makes peace with North Korea and Iran.\\n\\nAlthough Trump did not win this year, there have been at least three nominations for him announced already for the 2021 prize. Tybring-Gjedde, who nominated Trump in 2018, wrote to Oslo in support of him again in September, citing the importance of a U.S.-brokered peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.\\n\\nWell-known for anti-immigrant and anti-Islam views in Norway, Tybring-Gjedde had previously stoked controversy for comparing the hijabs worn by Muslim women to robes worn by Ku Klux Klan members.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMagnus Jacobsson, a member for the center-right Christian Democrats in Sweden’s parliament, later announced he had nominated Trump for the prize because of U.S.-led peace talks between Kosovo and Serbia.\\n\\nA third nomination came shortly afterward from a group of Australian lawyers led by David Flint, an 82-year-old legal professor and monarchist campaigner whose eccentric comments have long earned him both fans and foes.\\n\\n“What he has done with the Trump Doctrine is that he has decided he would no longer have America in endless wars, wars which achieve nothing but the killing of thousands of young Americans,” Flint told Sky News Australia.\\n\\nAn unlikely prize\\n\\nDespite this praise, Trump-led negotiations in the Middle East and the Balkans have drawn some cautious reserve, with many arguing that they are small-scale and not the diplomatic breakthroughs Trump allies tout. North Korean talks have stalled since 2019, regardless of the hopes of a prize.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“If anything, peace on the Korean Peninsula is even more elusive today, given the specter of a nuclear-emboldened North Korea,” said Jean Lee, director of the Korean Center at the Wilson Center.\\n\\nTrump’s poor international approval ratings further hinder his case. Although divisive figures have won the prize before — Wein noted that Roosevelt was a controversial pick in 1906, as he had a reputation as an “imperialist and lover of the glory of war” — Trump’s abrasive style is a clear disadvantage.\\n\\nHeffermehl, the peace activist, has criticized the Norwegian Nobel Committee for not focusing on the original ethos of the prize, saying it should go to “champions of peace” who worked for a demilitarized “brotherhood of nations.\"\\n\\nThough to that, he added, “I consider Trump grossly irrelevant.”', 'HOUSTON — The Trump administration is trying to deport several women who allege they were mistreated by a Georgia gynecologist at an immigration detention center, according to their lawyers.\\n\\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has already deported six former patients who complained about Dr. Mahendra Amin, who has been accused of operating on migrant women without their consent or performing procedures that were medically unnecessary and potentially endangered their ability to have children. At least seven others at the Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla, Georgia, who had made allegations against the doctor have received word that they could soon be removed from the country, the lawyers said.\\n\\nHours after one detained woman spoke to federal investigators, she said ICE told her that it had lifted a hold on her deportation and she faced “imminent” removal.\\n\\nAnother woman was taken to a rural Georgia airport early Monday and told to sign deportation papers, only to be brought back to the facility as her lawyers sued in federal court.\\n\\nThey allege Amin performed operations that caused or worsened their pain without explaining what he was doing or giving them an alternative. Their stories fit a broader pattern of allegations made by detained women against Amin, some of them revealed in interviews with attorneys and medical records reviewed by The Associated Press.\\n\\nThe Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation, and the Department of Homeland Security\\'s inspector general also is investigating.\\n\\nAmin\\'s lawyer, Scott Grubman, has previously denied the doctor did anything wrong and called him a “highly respected physician who has dedicated his adult life to treating a high-risk, underserved population in rural Georgia.” Amin has stopped seeing women at Irwin County Detention Center.\\n\\nImmigrant advocates have urged federal investigators to examine not just the doctor but also the detention center and any role ICE had in sending patients to him.\\n\\nWhile people who have been deported might still be able to serve as witnesses in a criminal or civil case, many end up in unstable countries or situations where it becomes difficult to maintain contact with them. The deportations are occurring in the last weeks of President Donald Trump\\'s administration following his defeat by Democrat Joe Biden.\\n\\n“ICE is destroying the evidence needed for this investigation,” said Elora Mukherjee, a Columbia University law professor who is working with several of the women.\\n\\nICE said it had notified the Homeland Security inspector general “about any planned transfers or removals of Irwin detainees who were former patients of Dr. Amin.”\\n\\n“Any implication that ICE is attempting to impede the investigation by conducting removals of those being interviewed is completely false,” the agency said in a statement.\\n\\nThe Justice Department declined to comment. Grubman declined to say whether the doctor had spoken to investigators.\\n\\nMbeti Ndonga, 37, was taken to Amin last year after seeking treatment for abdominal pain and excessive vaginal bleeding. She said she wanted a new prescription to continue treatment ordered by a previous doctor. Instead, she said, Amin insisted she have a procedure known as dilation and curettage, in which tissue is removed from the uterus as a treatment for excessive bleeding. Her medical records show she was also given a laparoscopy, in which incisions are made in the abdomen.\\n\\n“He was adamant and said I must have surgery,” Ndonga told AP.\\n\\nWhen she awoke, she said Amin told her she would never be able to have children. It’s unclear whether that\\'s the case. She still suffers from bleeding and pain.\\n\\nNdonga has spoken twice to government investigators, most recently on Tuesday. “I told them that I was abused, tortured, dehumanized,” she said.\\n\\nWithin hours of her first interview last week, Ndonga and her lawyers say she was told ICE had lifted a hold on her deportation and she could be sent to Kenya at any time.\\n\\n“Mbeti\\'s fear in answering the investigators’ questions were that it would make her immigration case worse,\" Mukherjee said. “And within hours of the interview, her worst fears were realized.”\\n\\nAnother woman was taken to see Amin in February after requesting estrogen patches to treat hot flashes, following a hysterectomy performed by another doctor in 2014. She asked to be identified only by her first name, Yanira, because she fears being targeted by criminals if deported to Mexico.\\n\\nYanira said Amin told her he would perform a vaginal ultrasound and that she would need a Pap smear, a test for cancer in which a doctor collects cells from a woman\\'s cervix.\\n\\nBoth procedures caused her intense pain. After the Pap smear, Yanira said she noticed there was no lubrication on the tools Amin had used. She had trouble sitting for nearly a week.\\n\\n“We are humans. We are women. We have feelings,” she said. \"Just because we are detained doesn’t mean we should be treated like animals.”\\n\\nICE didn\\'t respond to questions about the two women, who were brought to the U.S. as young children. Ndonga was previously deported after being arrested for interference with government property, then apprehended by ICE after reentering the country, Mukherjee said.\\n\\nYanira entered immigration custody after being arrested for possession of less than a gram of cocaine or methamphetamine, criminal records show. Her attorneys notified the government Thursday that she wanted to talk to investigators about Amin. Early Monday, Yanira says she was driven to an airport to board a deportation flight. But another ICE agent approached to say she wouldn\\'t be deported because her lawyers had intervened.\\n\\nGrubman declined to comment, citing federal privacy law.\\n\\nICE policy instructs agents to “exercise all appropriate discretion on a case-by-case basis” regarding the deportation of “victims of crime, witnesses to crime, and individuals pursuing legitimate civil rights complaints.”\\n\\nThe agency said this week that it was “accommodating the interviews” done by government investigators. It added that once a detained migrant has exhausted all appeals, “they remain subject to a final order of removal ... and that order must be carried out.\"', 'Thousands of Muslims throughout India took to the streets Friday to protest French President Emmanuel Macron’s refusal to criminalize cartoons, resulting in about 2,000 arrests in Madhya Pradesh alone.\\n\\nThe largest Madhya Pradesh protest occurred in the large city of Bhopal, and resulted in the arrest of lawmaker Arif Masood. Muslims in Mumbai also assembled in protest, lining the roads with photos of Macron’s face so that cars would have no choice but to run them over.\\n\\nAs Friday is traditionally the day of the week when Muslims attend prayers at their local mosques, many convened around the world after the prayers to protest the French. In Islamabad, the capital of neighboring Pakistan, thousands attempted to storm the French Embassy, prompting police to use tear gas to hold back the crowd.\\n\\nThe Islamic world — including, notably, governments and heads of state — has erupted with anti-French sentiment following the beheading of Samuel Paty, a French teacher, on October 16. A teen Chechen immigrant beheaded Paty after parents of Paty’s students organized to call for a fatwa on the teacher. Paty used cartoons of Muhammad taken from the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo to teach a class on freedom of expression.\\n\\nMacron responded to the beheading by awarding Paty the Legion of Honor and declaring, “we will never give up our cartoons.” French police have shut down multiple mosques and arrested dozens of suspected jihadists, some for celebrating Paty’s death.\\n\\n“One of our countrymen was assassinated because he was teaching, because he was teaching his students about the freedom of expression, the freedom to believe or not believe,” Macron said following the incident. “It’s not a coincidence if tonight a teacher was struck, because the terrorist wanted to attack the values of the public, its light, the possibility to make our children, no matter where they come from, no matter what they believe or not believe, no matter what their religion is, to make them free citizens.”\\n\\nIslamic leaders like Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi all condemned Paris for failing to apologize for the cartoons or censor them. Notably, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been among the most supportive allies Macron has found around the world in the dispute.\\n\\nAccording to the Press Trust of India (PTI), police arrested 2,000 people for violating Chinese coronavirus social distancing measures to participate in calls for boycotting French products. India’s News18 added that many demanded an apology from Macron for condemning radical Islamic terrorism. Masood, the lawmaker, was among the march’s leaders. He used his time to speak to “urge[…] the Central government to snap all financial ties with France.”\\n\\nIn Mumbai, the protests were reportedly more subdued than in Bhopal and largely consisted of plastering the streets with photos of Macron.\\n\\n“Muslims in Mumbai pasted Macron’s photographs on roads. People, cars, dogs, cats are walking over the posters,” Maulana Abbas Rizvi, who participated in the event, told the Times of India. “He (Macron) had the audacity to under his government. He must be punished like this only. I congratulate Mumbai for punishing this wrongdoer like this.”\\n\\nThe protests across the border in Islamabad turned violent despite the nation being largely Islamist and the election a prime minister who supports global blasphemy laws enforced through the United Nations. While local reports suggest no major injuries, a crowd of about 3,000 men organized a failed effort to break through Islamabad’s red zone to reach the French embassy, demanding the expulsion of the nation’s ambassador. Many appeared on video attempting to climb over large shipping containers placed around the fortified area to keep mobs out; mob violence is not uncommon in Pakistan. Some hung Macron in effigy over a bridge.\\n\\nPakistanis attack the French Embassy in Islamabad. https://t.co/KVJTzwrkju pic.twitter.com/MzJGuXWtxd — Tarek Fatah (@TarekFatah) October 30, 2020\\n\\n“The police used tear gas shells to push back the protesters. The demonstrators staged sit-in at Aabpara Chowk and demanded the government to expel the French ambassador and boycott the products of the country, which is supporting the blasphemous caricatures at the state level,” Daily Pakistan reported.\\n\\nAs of Friday night, the mob responded to the tear gas by attacking police outposts and have stationed themselves in woodland near the barrier to the diplomatic zone and have reportedly declared they will stay overnight.\\n\\nAt least three other Pakistani cities — Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar — experienced anti-French protests on Friday.\\n\\nKhan has responded to national outrage not by calling for a boycott of France, but claiming that he will lead a global effort to criminalize anything any Muslim may deem offensive anywhere in the world. In remarks on Friday, Khan said that Europeans were ignorant of the sensibilities of Muslims and that, as Muslims, it is “our responsibility to apprise them of the sentiments of Muslim community.”\\n\\nProtests also reportedly occurred in Bangladesh, which already say a group of 40,000 people convene on Tuesday to call for a French boycott; Lebanon, where Macron has been instrumental in first response to August’s deadly explosion in the port of Beirut; Israel, where Palestinians called for a “day of rage;” and the United Kingdom.\\n\\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.', 'When clashes between residents and police erupted onto the streets of Brixton in 1981, in the heart of London\\'s African-Caribbean community, the British press largely told one side of the story.\\n\\nThe Brixton riots , as they became known, were primarily depicted as a challenge to the rule of law. The press emphasized criminal elements, characterizingyoung, Black male protesters as \"troublemakers\" during those disturbances, according to studies cited in a subsequent analysis of how the UK media covered riots in 2011.\\n\\nNews reports at the time failed to account for the issues that were at the heart of the riots in 1981, including unemployment, racism and oppressive policing, in particular the extensive use of stop and search. That media bias was spotted by Val McCalla, who had arrived in England aged 15 some two decades earlier.\\n\\nJamaican-born McCalla was working at local London paper East End News when the Brixton clashes happened. He saw the need for a newspaper that would address the issues that mattered to British-born African-Caribbean people who were trying to stake their claim to the only country they had ever known.\\n\\nWith the help of a £62,000 ($81,000) loan from Barclays, McCalla launched The Voice in August 1982 at the Notting Hill Carnival, Europe\\'s biggest street party and a proud celebration of African-Caribbean culture.

Earlier this year, the Institute published research showing that none of Britain\\'s top 10 print, digital or broadcast outlets have a Black editor in chief.\\n\\nAnd a recent study by Women in Journalism, a campaigning organization, found that during one week in July not a single story by a Black reporter appeared on the front pages of the 11 most widely read UK newspapers.\\n\\nThe lack of diversity in UK newsrooms underscores how vital The Voice\\'s pioneering work has been, even if too little has changed elsewhere in the media since its inception.\\n\\nCampaigning for justice\\n\\n\"Without doubt it blazed a trail,\" said Joseph Harker , deputy opinion editor at The Guardian. The Voice \"spoke to that much younger, more energetic, angrier section of the population. It was the first Black newspaper aimed at Black British people,\" he added.\\n\\nHarker joined the paper in 1987 straight out of university and spent four years there, first as a reporter and later as news and assistant editor. He was used to reading negative stories about Black people relating to crime, poverty and unemployment. Working at The Voice, where Black excellence was celebrated and where he was surrounded by Black ambition and success, had a profound impact on him.\\n\\n\"It completely transformed my sense of what being Black means,\" Harker told CNN Business. The mainstream media had no interest in Black people \"apart from crime stories and riots,\" he added. \"If it was anything positive about Black people it just wouldn\\'t be covered.\"\\n\\nThe inaugural edition of The Voice newspaper, launched at the Notting Hill Carnival in August 1982.\\n\\nFrom its founding, The Voice\\'s vision was that \"Britain\\'s fast-growing black community should have a voice amid all the social unrest erupting during the 1970s and early 1980s,\" the paper\\'s acting managing director George Ruddock wrote in an October 2019 editorial, announcing its move from weekly to monthly publication.\\n\\nIts first issue (pictured above) led with a story about a Pakistani family in east London that was being targeted by a racist gang, marking what Ruddock considered to be \"the beginning of the publication\\'s long-standing reputation for campaigning on the many issues which affect the welfare of black Britain.\"\\n\\nNearly four decades later, The Voice continues to \"campaign, celebrate and educate,\" according to Paulette Simpson, executive director of The Voice Media Group. The newspaper changed hands in 2004, two years after McCalla died, and is now part of GV Media Group Limited.\\n\\nThe Windrush scandal , which erupted in 2017, remains one of its \"big campaigning issues,\" added Simpson. Windrush refers to the name of the ship that brought a generation of Caribbean immigrants to Britain in the late 1940s to help rebuild the country following World War II.\\n\\nSubsequent changes to immigration laws wrongfully deprived many of them and their descendants of their rights to British citizenship.

A digital version of the newspaper reaches readers across the United Kingdom, as well as in Africa and the United States.\\n\\n\"I think sadly it\\'s not as relevant now as it was in its heyday, in the early and mid 90s,\" said Harker of The Guardian. This is partly to do with the changing makeup of Britain\\'s Black population, with more immigrants from east and west Africa, and more racial integration than before, he added.\\n\\nStill, many of the stories The Voice covers won\\'t be found elsewhere, which makes it a treasure trove of Black British history and brings a unique flavor to its content today.\\n\\nFor example, the September issue features a piece on the growing popularity of homeschooling among Black families and in August it explored the contribution that Black businesses make to the UK economy.

She argued six landmark cases on gender equality before the U.S. Supreme Court, winning five of them to eliminate legal barriers that held women back in the workplace and civic life. She strategically advanced cases that would establish precedents for treating men and women equally under the law in such areas as jury duty requirements, Social Security and military spousal benefits, and even the legal drinking age.\\n\\n\"She is to the women\\'s movement what former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall was to the movement for the rights of African-Americans,\" then-President Clinton said when he nominated her to fill the Supreme Court seat being vacated by retiring Justice Byron White.\\n\\n\"I am proud to nominate this path-breaking attorney, advocate, and judge,\" he said, portraying her as a nonpartisan choice. \"Ruth Bader Ginsburg cannot be called a liberal or a conservative; she has proved herself too thoughtful for such labels.\"\\n\\nGinsburg won Senate confirmation by a vote of 96 to 3.\\n\\n\"Her 27 years on the Court exceeded even my highest expectations when I appointed her,\" Mr. Clinton said in a statement following her death. \"Her landmark opinions advancing gender equality, marriage equality, the rights of people with disabilities, the rights of immigrants, and so many more moved us closer to \\'a more perfect union\\'.\"\\n\\nShe has described her approach to the law as cautious and measured, but over a quarter-century on the high court she assembled a track record of decisions placing her firmly in the court\\'s liberal wing. She supported abortion rights, marriage equality, the Affordable Care Act, and women seeking restitution for unequal pay.\\n\\nConservatives criticized her for straying too far from the Founding Fathers\\' original meaning of the Constitution. But when CBS News\\' Mike Wallace pointed out to her in a 2006 interview that the Constitution never mentioned abortion or same-sex marriage, she responded: \"Think back to 1787. Who were \\'we the people\\'? … They certainly weren\\'t women … they surely weren\\'t people held in human bondage. The genius of our Constitution is that over now more than 200 sometimes turbulent years that \\'we\\' has expanded and expanded.\"\\n\\nDespite their very different ideological views, Ginsburg became close friends with the fiery conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016.

Images of the dolls and cages come up in a quick Google search of “kids in cages,” a repeated Democrat talking point through the last three years of President Trump’s administration.\\n\\nWatch below:\\n\\nIn 2018, the Trump administration enforced its zero-tolerance policy to stop the flow of illegal adult border crossers from arriving at the country with minor children.\\n\\nThe separation of adult border crossers from the children they arrive with, though, has occurred since before 2001, court records have shown, and the Obama administration used the same detention centers that are currently being used.\\n\\nDetaining child border crossers was a policy during the Obama administration, where Breitbart Texas exclusively reported on the conditions in which unaccompanied minors were being packed into crowded cells and holding facilities.\\n\\nAs for Schumer, this is but her latest attempt to boost voter turnout ahead of the November election. Last month, the Trainwreck star teamed up with Seinfeld writer and actor Larry David for a primetime ABC election special, called VOMO: Vote or Miss Out, that also featured Michelle Obama and her voter registration group, When We All Vote.\\n\\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.', 'President-elect Joe Biden appears to be all-in on the globalist idea of a worldwide \"reset\" to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, Laura Ingraham warned viewers Thursday.\\n\\n\"They\\'d like a new normal, and they don\\'t like that old normal where Americans enjoyed their freedoms, the freedoms we often take for granted, like the right to work, to run a business, to attend school, the right to travel, and so on,\" said \"The Ingraham Angle\" host.\\n\\nAs proof, Ingraham cited a member of Biden\\'s COVID-19 advisory board, University of Minnesota epidemiologist Dr. Michael Osterholm.\\n\\n\"We could lock down for four to six weeks, and if we did that, we could drive the numbers down,\" Osterholm told Yahoo Finance. \"Then we could really watch ourselves cruising into the vaccine availability [period] in the first and second quarter of next year, and bringing back the economy long before that.\"\\n\\nIngraham argued that such a policy would be \"no big deal to the people like Osterholm and the elites in charge, because they are always going to have jobs.\\n\\n\"But for the millions of others, businesses will close, jobs will be lost, schools will remain closed, depression and suicide numbers will go up, and other illnesses will be left untreated and undetected.\"\\n\\nAs another example, Ingraham cited German engineer Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, who wrote in June about the need \"to create a healthier, more equitable and more prosperous future.\"\\n\\n\"Fairer outcomes by coordination in tax regulatory, trade, and fiscal policy. It all may include changes to wealth taxes; the withdrawal of fossil fuel subsidies; and new rules governing influential intellectual property, trade, and competition; and transitioning from fossil fuels to green energy,\" Ingraham said.\\n\\n\"Does that sound familiar? It is basically Biden\\'s agenda. When Biden said we\\'re going to work with our allies, what he really means is he\\'s going to let them have veto power over our trade initiatives, our patent and trademark laws, and our energy industry - and that\\'s just a start,\" she said.\\n\\nThis weekend, Ingraham noted, Biden is at his Delaware beach house, likely working with his advisers on the goals of this \"reset.\"\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"As he plans to tighten the screws on Americans with higher taxes, more restrictions, and Lord knows what else, he plans to open up the country ... to a mass influx of illegal aliens. Refugees. H-1B workers, they are going to have an open society, open door, come on in. The rest of us? Not so much,\" she said.\\n\\n\"Because that is how we are going to get to a world that is fairer and more equitable. Unfortunately, it\\'s going to require you to work harder for less. Less money, and less freedom. And now what\\'s more frightening: Getting COVID, or living in that America?\"', 'President Donald Trump is on track to raise his share of Asian American voters to perhaps 35 percent in 2020, up from perhaps 27 percent in 2016.\\n\\nAsian Americans are just five percent of the nation’s voters, and most are concentrated in blue states along the coasts. But every slice of voters is vital in an election that may be decided by just a few tens of thousands of voters in North Carolina, Nevada, Georgia, and other states.\\n\\nA September 15 poll of 1,569 voters showed Trump’s support at 30 percent, with 15 percent saying “don’t know.”\\n\\nBut he scored 37 percent support in swing states outside New York and California. Also, 37 percent of Asian voters said they have a “very favorable” or “somewhat favorable” view of Trump, compared to a 53 percent positive response to Joe Biden.\\n\\nThe September poll also showed that GOP candidates have 34 percent support from Asian voters, plus some share of the 18 percent who said they had not picked a candidate.\\n\\nThe poll comes as other data shows how identity-politics Democrats underestimated the popularity of Trump’s populist policies among Latinos.\\n\\nIn the Asian poll, Trump’s support was strongest among Vietnamese Americans, at 48 percent, and weakest among Chinese Americans, at just 20 percent.\\n\\nIndian American voters offered Trump just 28 percent support, with only six percent undecided despite Trump’s repeated support for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\\n\\nA major issue for Indian American voters is the campaign by Fortune 500 companies to provide fast-track green cards to the hundreds of thousands of Indians who are being imported for white-collar jobs via the H-1B, J-1, OPT, and L-1 worker pipelines. The Senate bill offering more green cards, S.386, has been blocked by GOP senators. The unpopular bill was blocked because it would dramatically help Fortune 500 CEOs dangle offers of green cards to recruit many more Indians for Americans’ white-collar jobs.\\n\\nTrump is getting support from some Indian American voters, including Indian Voices for Trump. The Indian Voices group has eclipsed the Republican Hindu Coalition, which supported Trump in 2016.\\n\\nThe Indian Voices group is run by Al Mason, a real estate investor. The co-chair is Mrinalini Kumari.\\n\\nTrump Power: 50% + Indian American Democrats In Each of The Battle Ground State Are Crossing Over To ReElect President @realDonaldTrump Come Nov 3rd 2020 🇾 pic.twitter.com/LVRB2CBwR7 — Al Mason (@opinionbazaar) June 25, 2020\\n\\nHowever, Trump’s base consists of Americans who worry about losing their jobs and communities to imported workers. The base delivered him into the White House in 2016, leaving him little room to woo the subset of Asian immigrant voters who want more immigration and more diversity.\\n\\nFor 2020, Trump is offering “pro-American immigration” policies plus deregulation for business.\\n\\nIn contrast, Biden is offering a combination of Wall Street’s cheap-labor policies and progressives’ support for large-scale migration and diversity. Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris, is the daughter of an Indian immigrant.\\n\\nBut Trump may not need migration concessions to win votes from Asian American voters, just as he does not need to offer amnesty to win large slices of the Latino vote. These nonwhite voters have a variety of normal reasons to oppose the Democrats’ corrosive policies on the economy, university admissions, policing, foreign policy, and cultural issues such as racial claims and transgender promotion.\\n\\nFor example, the Times of India reported September 18 on the administration’s outreach to Indian American voters, which emphasized national security rather than free movement of Indian workers:\\n\\nAt the formal launch event of Indian Voices for Trump, Eric [Trump] referred to his father’s foreign policy on China and Pakistan, which he said “is very different from his predecessors.” “I think that’s very different than past presidents, to tell you the truth. I think when you see how past presidents have emboldened China. And you see the problems that Indians are having with China and will likely have with China and in fact the whole world will probably have with China at some point. You know the problems with Pakistan better than I ever will,” he said. … In his welcome address, Indian Voices for Trump board member Ritesh Desai thanked President Trump and his family for supporting Indian-Americans and strengthening U.S.-India ties.\\n\\nIndia and the United States are natural allies, Desai said at the September 17 meeting in Georgia.\\n\\nThe September survey was run by Asian Americans Advancing Justice, APIAVote, and AAPI Data. The New York Times downplayed Trump’s gains as it reported Setempber 15:\\n\\n“Through this survey, we see that Asian-Americans are ready to exercise their power,” said John C. Yang, the head of Asian Americans Advancing Justice – AAJC, an advocacy group that co-sponsored the survey.\\n\\nIn contrast, the data about Trump’s claimed 27 percent score in 2016 came from a small-scale exit poll, NPR reported. The 2017 data came from a much larger survey by the Democrat-leaning Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF):\\n\\nThe difference in the [two survey’] results lies, in large part, because of how the polling was conducted. AALDEF surveyed close to 14,000 Asian-American voters, more than 14 times the number of Asian-American participants in Edison Research’s [exit] poll. While Edison Research conducted polling in English and Spanish, AALDEF used questionnaires written in English and 11 Asian languages including Chinese, Bengali, Korean, Tagalog, and Vietnamese, plus volunteers who could speak 23 Asian languages and dialects.\\n\\nBoth the 2020 AAJC poll and the 2017 AALDEF poll show that Trump’s vote share was very different in the various groups of Asian immigrants.\\n\\nSome of the groups are antagonistic to each other, and they have different priorities over trade, integration, economics, migration, and national security.\\n\\nFor example, Trump got 24 percent of Chinese American votes in 2016, says AALDEF. Trump now gets 20 percent support in the AAJC’s 2020 survey, plus some share of the 23 percent “don’t know” responses in the AAJC survey.\\n\\nIn contrast, Trump got 14 percent of Indians’ vote in 2016 and may reach 28 percent in 2020, according to the two surveys.\\n\\nIn 2016, Trump got just nine percent of Arab American votes, 14 percent of Korean American votes, 27 percent of Filipino American votes, and 32 percent of Vietnamese American votes, according to the 2017 survey.\\n\\nThe AAJC’s 2020 poll showed Trump’s declared support was higher outside blue-state New York and California.']\n"

      "[\"POLITICO Playbook: President Trump and Melania have Covid-19. What now? Presented by Facebook  President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump will remain at home after being diagnosed with Covid-19. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images  DRIVING THE DAY  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP -- who is tested for the coronavirus daily and has downplayed its risks, mocked the use of masks, proudly held large political rallies and suggested the nation should get back to its pre-virus business -- has tested positive for the deadly disease 32 DAYS before Election Day, pushing the nation’s political and governing apparatus into a historic state of flux.  TRUMP, 74, tweeted at 12:54 a.m.: “Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!” This comes after senior White House aide HOPE HICKS tested positive.  THE PRESIDENT and first lady will “remain at home within the White House during their convalescence,” White House physician SEAN CONLEY said in a memo released by the White House at 1:05 a.m. The doc’s memo  IT’S EXTRAORDINARILY EARLY, we don’t know much at the moment, and we all need to be vigilant about everything we say and suppose. But here are some early points to frame your thinking:  1) EVERY MOVE MADE, every word uttered and tweet published by the White House will be under a microscope as the world tries to understand the health of the most powerful man in the world. We will be looking this morning for test results and assurance from VP MIKE PENCE and Speaker NANCY PELOSI.  2) THE WHITE HOUSE does not have the public’s trust, and at a time like this, that’s important.  3) THE PRESIDENT will be quarantined for some time, so the 2020 CAMPAIGN as we knew it will be effectively paused in its final stretch. How can they allow TRUMP in a room with the 77-year-old JOE BIDEN for another debate at this point? How can TRUMP hold another in-person rally? It seems extremely unlikely.  THE ENTIRETY of the president’s political message was that he handled the coronavirus pandemic well, the end was in sight, and people should think back to before the onset of the virus when they consider their vote. TRUMP’S diagnosis will make that quite tricky. NYT’s Jonathan Martin, Maggie Haberman and Matt Stevens on the political implications  -- NYT’S MAGGIE HABERMAN and PETER BAKER say this: “If [Trump] becomes sick, it could raise questions about whether he should remain on the ballot at all.”  4) ONE WOULD IMAGINE the administration and the Congress will do everything they can to preserve the health of the rest of the chain of command. That means that PENCE, PELOSI and Sen. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-Iowa) will likely have to take extra precautions. PELOSI is 80 and GRASSLEY is 87. They are No. 2 and No. 3 in the line of succession, after PENCE.  5) BIDEN will certainly be tested. Political and financial markets will be incredibly interested in his results.  6) THE PRESIDENT’S DIAGNOSIS should, theoretically, force Congress to rethink its testing regime. Reminder: Members of Congress are forced to travel to D.C. to vote, but they are not tested. THE HOUSE is going to leave after today. THE SENATE will be in next week -- as of now. There will be an effort to show government can still operate with the commander in chief sidelined.  TRUMP’S ILLNESS could have long-term political and practical implications, but, as of now, it appears as if the government will continue to operate as normal in the short term. Federal agencies have been operating in a pandemic mode for months.  THERE HAVE BEEN MANY ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS swarming Capitol Hill. White House chief of staff MARK MEADOWS has been in contact with SCOTUS nominee AMY CONEY BARRETT, Senate Majority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL and a host of other key GOP senators. Treasury Secretary STEVEN MNUCHIN, who typically wears a mask, was at an in-person meeting with PELOSI on Wednesday.

A BIT OF THE BACK STORY … NYT’S MAGGIE HABERMAN and ANNIE KARNI: “It is not yet clear when and how Mr. Trump contracted the virus. The president and the first lady said they had both tested positive hours after one of his closest aides, Hope Hicks, also tested positive. Ms. Hicks received the diagnosis after she began experiencing symptoms on Wednesday while attending the president’s rally in Minnesota. Mr. Trump kept his appearance there to about 45 minutes, roughly half the length of one of his typical rally speeches.  “Early Friday morning, it was still unclear how many other aides who had come into close contact with Mr. Trump had tested positive, but the White House said its medical unit was conducting contact tracing. Top advisers to the president described themselves as in a state of shock and said they expected a number of additional cases among people in Mr. Trump’s orbit. White House officials had hoped to keep the news about Ms. Hicks from becoming public, to no avail. …  “On Tuesday Mr. Trump was accompanied by all of his adult children and senior members of his White House and campaign staff on Air Force One en route to Cleveland for the first presidential debate. None of them wore masks as they were seen boarding and deplaning. Bill Stepien, the president’s campaign manager, was seen on board without a mask and then was spotted getting into a staff van with Ms. Hicks.”  WAPO’S JOSH DAWSEY and COLBY ITKOWITZ: “After White House officials learned of Hicks’s symptoms, Trump and his entourage flew Thursday to New Jersey, where he attended a fundraiser at his golf club in Bedminster and delivered a speech. Trump was in close contact with dozens of other people, including campaign supporters, at a roundtable event.”  CREDIT WHERE DUE -- The news of Hicks’ positive diagnosis was first reported by Bloomberg’s JENNIFER JACOBS, not disclosed by the White House.  MARKETWATCH … WSJ: “U.S. Stock Futures Drop After Trump Tests Positive for Covid-19,” by Chong Koh Ping  TRUMP’S, UH, UPDATED FRIDAY SCHEDULE -- The president will host a phone call on Covid-19 support for vulnerable seniors at 12:15 p.m. in the White House.  HOURS BEFORE THE POLITICAL UNIVERSE SHIFTED ON ITS AXIS -- “Biden flip-flops on door-knocking with just 33 days left,” by Alex Thompson and Holly Otterbein  Good Friday morning.  FOR THE RECORD -- 48 HOURS. That’s how long it took for TRUMP to condemn white supremacists after coming under fire for comments during the presidential debate. Last night on SEAN HANNITY’S Fox New show: “I condemn the KKK. I condemn all white supremacists. I condemn the Proud Boys. I don’t know much about the Proud Boys, almost nothing, but I condemn that,” Trump said in a phone interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. “But [Biden] should condemn also Antifa. Antifa is a horrible group of people.” More from Matthew Choi  -- AP: “Trump debate comment pushing Black Americans, others to vote,” by Kat Stafford in Detroit, Jay Reeves in Birmingham, Ala., and Christine Fernando in East Greenwich, R.I.

Buoyed by polls showing him leading President Donald Trump, Biden’s campaign boosted its TV advertising budget to $4.1 million for this month, nearly quadruple what he spent last month and two-thirds of his total ad budget for the state. The day after the first debate with Trump in Cleveland, Biden made his first appearance in Ohio on Wednesday as the Democratic presidential nominee.  “A confluence of forces has made Ohio competitive again in the eyes of Democrats. The economy and health care amid the pandemic are bad. Trump is bleeding white working-class and suburban voters in polls. Conservatives in the state are warring with Republican Gov. Mike DeWine for locking down the state during the pandemic. And DeWine’s Republican predecessor, John Kasich, is backing Biden. ‘We’re going to win Ohio,’ Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) declared in an interview. ‘Biden is the most pro-worker nominee of either party in a generation.’” POLITICO  -- “Democrats Mount an All-Out Effort to Get Detroit to Vote,” by NYT’s Kathleen Gray in Detroit  -- BURGESS EVERETT and JAMES ARKIN: “Liebermans haunt Democrats in key Senate races”  -- TIM ALBERTA in Lake Orion, Mich.: “Has Elissa Slotkin Detected Early Hints of a Biden Blowout?”  MORE GOP CRACKDOWN ON MAIL-IN VOTING -- “Abbott orders counties to close multiple ballot drop-off sites,” by the Austin American-Statesman’s Chuck Lindell and Nicole Cobler: “Gov. Greg Abbott ordered Texas counties Thursday to close multiple locations where voters can drop off completed mail-in ballots. As an election security measure, Abbott said, counties will be limited to one drop-off site where poll watchers — designated by political parties and candidates — must be allowed to observe ballot deliveries by voters.  “The new order takes effect Friday, and it modified Abbott’s July 27 order that acknowledged the pandemic’s danger by adding six days of early voting and waiving a state law that limits mail-in ballot drop-off to Election Day only. Democrats blasted Thursday’s change as a thinly veiled effort to suppress votes in a tight election. ‘Republicans are on the verge of losing, so Gov.

That\\'s the problem.” Then the twist: “Coons ain\\'t that way. I remember when he started in politics, and I used to live on 9th and Franklin, and I\\'d see him.”  AD  Matthews took a handout and sounded open to supporting Scarane. The year\\'s final battle between the Democratic Party\\'s left and center is unfolding today in a state that has been hostile to the Trump-era GOP, emboldening activists who want “corporate” members of Congress replaced. It\\'s also a place where incumbents can shake every primary voter\\'s hand — and usually do, when the country isn\\'t in the grip of a pandemic.  “In the middle of a campaign I literally meet thousands and thousands of people,” Coons said in an interview this weekend, after stopping by the city\\'s waterfront for an event recognizing Delaware\\'s Hispanic businesses. “On a typical Fourth of July, we\\'d go to five parades, where I\\'d shake thousands of hands. Epidemiologically, that\\'s a really bad idea right now.”  AD  Scarane, a digital strategist who\\'s raised more than $300,000, is trying to build on the left\\'s four-year project of changing the Democratic Party, in a place where the movement is playing catch-up. Two years ago, activist and veteran Kerri Evelyn Harris challenged Sen. Thomas R. Carper, who had been running successful races statewide since 1976. She got 35 percent of the vote after spending less than $200,000, revealing that there was a base for left-wing politics in a state politically dominated by moderate suburbanites.  AD  “There\\'s people who may have voted in that race had Kerri gained traction earlier, which is one reason we started earlier,” said Scarane, who announced her bid last November. “There\\'s definitely been a shift in favor of things like Medicare-for-all and a Green New Deal among Democrats in this state.”  The nomination of Joe Biden, who endorsed Coons and appears on his literature, revealed the intraparty limits of that agenda. (“I like Coons the best,” Biden told reporters Monday after casting an early vote.) The left saw 2018 as a building year in Delaware, finding potential voters and linking together volunteers who could at the very least win lower-turnout elections down the ballot.  AD  The Coons-Scarane race has not attracted the same national investments as the Carper-Harris race, when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigned in Wilmington and Justice Democrats lent staff and money for the primary challenge. Both have ignored this race, viewing others as more winnable, with the New York-based Working Families Party providing the biggest out-of-state muscle for Scarane. But the campaign itself claims to have tapped 1,200 volunteers, knocked 40,000 doors and made 900,000 calls using the Democratic voter file, while WFP has run digital ads against Coons as part of down-ballot investments in Delaware.  AD  “Progressive donors, who used to support national Democrats but weren\\'t as active at the local level, have been activated,” said WFP\\'s Mid-Atlantic political director Vanessa Clifford, who co-managed the 2018 Harris campaign. “There weren\\'t many serious challengers before Kerri\\'s run two years ago.”  Scarane\\'s case against Coons is simple, even if it takes some explaining at the doors. Elected in 2010, Coons has voted reliably with Democrats on their major priorities but prioritized bipartisan work while rejecting the agenda associated with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Like other Justice Democrats, Scarane puts the blame on corporate PAC money — she refuses it — and argues that Coons would impede the party\\'s agenda if it took back power. Like Harris, she\\'s tried to make the race a referendum on the “Delaware Way,” in which business-friendly candidates trade their seats but never enact a liberal agenda.  AD  “There are certain people who\\'ve bought into the line that bipartisanship is important, and we need a Congress that gets along,” Scarane said in an interview at her Wilmington home. “But there are other people who see the senator as quick to run to the other side instead of standing with us on the things Democrats should be fighting for.”  AD  Coons was not around for the votes that became vulnerabilities for Carper, like the 2002 authorization of war in Iraq. Scarane has focused instead on his support for Senate supermajority rules and questioned his commitment to supporting liberal judges. For evidence, she cites both his reluctance to end the filibuster and his 2013 vote against Debo Adegbile, an attorney nominated by President Barack Obama to help lead the civil rights division of the Justice Department.  Both questions, at the root, ask whether Coons would undermine a post-election liberal agenda. On the filibuster, Coons said he would see where events took the Senate, if Democrats took control and were trying to pass a Biden administration\\'s agenda. Step one was trying to form consensus, and step two was tbd.  AD  “If Minority Leader McConnell — doesn\\'t that sound good? — uses the filibuster to block progress on any sort of legislative progress, then I\\'m not going to stand by and watch,” Coons said, citing immigration and gun safety as legislative priorities with Republican support. “I got to the Senate in 2011, and I\\'m not willing to see repeats of what he did to Obama, when we got nothing done for years.”  AD  The Adegbile issue was trickier. When Democrats held the Senate, Coons joined every Republican and six other Democrats to block the Obama nominee. Adegbile had argued in a brief that Mumia Abu-Jamal, a death-row inmate convicted of killing a police officer, had been victimized by racially biased jury selection. The Fraternal Order of Police opposed Adegbile, and so did Coons. Reflecting on it now, Coons said, he should have worked harder to get to yes, but he said he was unable to square Adegbile\\'s record with his feelings over the killing of the officer.  “In the run-up to the vote, I had asked Debo if he would call the widow of Dan Faulkner and express some regret about how the whole issue had ended up. And he would not. And I may have overreacted to that. I\\'ve had long conversations with the civil rights community here to say that I recognize that he would have been a great assistant attorney general for civil rights.”  AD  Unlike Carper, Coons will end the primary without debating his opponent, depriving Scarane of the chance to confront him directly on his votes. But like many other incumbents facing challengers this year, Coons emphasized his liberal bona fides, pitching himself as a Biden ally who could get things done, and he\\'s kept nearly every elected official in the party on his side. Bryan Townsend, a liberal state senator who won his seat by ousting the more moderate Democratic incumbent, argued that Coons\\'s strong reputation with Republican senators positioned him perfectly to be a liberal dealmaker in a Biden-run Washington.  AD  “Whatever his portfolio positions are, they come along with a tremendously hard work ethic and an ability to articulate the issues in a way that appeals to a broad number of people,” Townsend said. “There\\'s a lot to be said for electing someone who is going to be able to hold the institution together from both sides, and make progress. I think in some ways he is taking undue heat for the idea that he isn\\'t ‘progressive’ on this or that issue or sufficiently progressive, because he\\'s focused on trying to figure out what can get done, as quickly as possible.”  While broadcasting confidence about the race, Coons has spent $4 million on his campaign, most of it on resources that can be turned around for the seven-week general election but much of it to beat Scarane. Two years ago, the left badly underestimated what it would take to beat Carper, as a surge of suburban turnout overwhelmed Harris\\'s 29,406 votes — thousands more than her campaign thought she needed. More than 100,000 Delawareans had requested mail ballots by the end of Monday, and both Scarane and Coons were expecting high turnout.  AD  They were seeking their final votes in very different ways. On Saturday, Coons visited some outdoor parks where his campaign had rented space for socially distant canvassing and phone-banking. He marveled at Mack McKay, a 79-year-old supporter from his church, who had made tens of thousands of calls, and he gave one caller some advice for her voter conversations: She could mention that he was one of very few Democrats who supported a commission to study reparations.  AD  On Friday, Scarane and her supporters were at the doors, having conversations that ranged from polite to promising. Voters had nothing negative to say about Coons, and some had recollections about meeting him. Scarane kept the pitch to the agenda she\\'d take to Washington, always starting by saying the system was “working great for the very wealthy” and seeing where the voter took it.  “It sounds like you\\'ve got some good ideas, and we need new blood in there,” said Randi Williams, a 59-year-old lab technician. With a Senate candidate on her doorstep, Williams turned to her chief electoral concern: How would Democrats defeat Donald Trump?  Reading list  “Devastating wildfires out West inject climate change into the presidential campaign,” by Seung Min Kim and Brady Dennis  AD  Climate change and the 2020 race.

Dems in disarray.  “Trump’s first indoor rally in months staged as a rebuke to coronavirus restrictions,” by Anne Gearan and Josh Dawsey  The meaning of a crowded room in Nevada.  How can a mighty field program work with voters stuck at home?  In the states  The very, very long primary season, which started in Texas six months ago, comes to an end today in Delaware.  Mostly.  Let\\'s be sticklers. In Louisiana and Georgia, all-party primaries will be held Nov. 3 — for every major office in the former, and for the seat held by Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) in the latter. But today\\'s contests in Delaware close the chapter on partisan primaries, and when the votes are in, nearly every two-party matchup in 49 states will be set.  Most attention will gravitate to the Coons-Scarane primary, by far the costliest race on the ballot. It\\'s not a rematch, as Coons has never faced a well-funded challenger and Scarane has never run for office before. But in some ways, it\\'s round two of the left\\'s Delaware project, an effort to create a beachhead in a place that has moved away from Republicans during Donald Trump\\'s presidency.  That project began in 2018 with Kerri Evelyn Harris\\'s campaign, and the vote patterns today will reveal whether the left can make more gains with suburbanites. Harris did best in vote-rich New Castle County, winning 37 percent of the vote there, and ran strongest near Newark, home to the University of Delaware. She did worst in the outlying suburbs that vote Republican in general elections and worse still in Delaware\\'s more rural counties, Kent and Sussex. Coons starts out as a heavy favorite in all three counties, and the high number of absentee ballot request and early votes — factors not there in 2018 — suggest a high-turnout election.  After 2018, Delaware Republicans were locked out of power in the state, a punctuation mark on a long decline. They have not won the state\\'s sole seat in the House of Representatives since 2008, they have not won a Senate election since 1994, and they have been locked out of the governor\\'s office since 1988. The party\\'s recruitment this year doesn\\'t point to much optimism about reversing the decline, especially with a well-liked Joe Biden leading the Democratic ticket.  Still, Republicans will field candidates for every major office on the ballot this year. The state GOP has endorsed attorney Julianne Murray for governor, but she\\'s facing five opponents, including state Sen. Colin Bonini, who ran and lost to Democratic Gov. John Carney by 19 points in 2016. Republicans have also endorsed veteran Jim DeMartino and actor Lee Murphy, respectively, to take on the winner of the Democrats\\' Senate primary and two-term Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester.  Primary upsets are possible in each race. DeMartino has been heavily outspent by Lauren Witzke, a pro-Trump activist who’s tweeted the slogan (“WWG1WGA”) of the QAnon conspiracy theory movement and has been adept at getting attention despite the steep odds against her. Though not endorsed by Trump, Witzke tweeted at the president and his son Donald Trump Jr. on Monday, claiming that a child had been egged “by hateful leftists” at one of her campaign events. The president’s son retweeted it.  Murphy has raised less than $60,000 for his race, less than Witzke, but far more than his challenger, Matthew Morris. Still, Morris has gotten some attention by pitching himself as “the great American comeback story” — beating an opioid addiction to turn his life around.  Further down the ballot, the left is watching some local primaries closely, to see if they can repeat the breakthroughs they\\'ve been pulling off in other state races for city and legislative offices. The Working Families Party, which has endorsed Scarane, is backing two candidates for Wilmington\\'s city council, Colby Owens and Shané Darby. It\\'s also supporting four candidates in state legislative seats that are likely to go Democratic in November: Madinah Wilson-Anton, Larry Lambert, Marie Pinkney and Eric Morrison. If victorious, Pinkney could become the first Black gay woman in the state legislature; Sarah McBride, a transgender activist running for a safe state Senate seat in Wilmington, could become the state\\'s first trans legislator if she wins today\\'s primary.  Ad watch  American Chemistry Council, “Chris Coons.\" In Delaware, Jessica Scarane\\'s main argument against Sen. Christopher A. Coons is that he\\'s too beholden to campaign donors, especially corporate PACs. One of those business interests has been running ads to boost Coons, asking (as all such ads must ask, to conform to campaign law) voters to “call Chris Coons today and tell him thanks” for backing a stimulus and changes to the supply chain.  Donald Trump, “Joe Biden Has Done Absolutely NOTHING for America in 47 Years!” The latest spot from the president\\'s campaign hands the microphone to a woman, never named, who says confidently that Joe Biden could “never handle the economy after covid.” Like many Trump ads, however, it focuses mostly on the economy before the pandemic, citing a headline about “women and minorities return[ing] to the workforce” that ran in The Washington Post 18 months ago.  Restoration PAC, “Just Begun.” A super PAC funded almost entirely by Illinois megadonor Richard Uihlein, Restoration has run a string of ads in the Midwest supporting local Republican candidates and making very different arguments against Joe Biden. One ad, running 120 seconds long, reintroduced voters to the plagiarism controversy that sunk Biden\\'s 1988 presidential bid. This one only features Biden in a montage of Democrats who “hate” and “spied on” Trump to encourage the president\\'s base that nothing can stop him. “They hate him because he\\'s unraveling their schemes and draining the swamp, and they despise all those who support his efforts,” a narrator says.  You are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox.    Poll watch  If Joe Biden was president, would he have handled the summer\\'s unrest better or worse? (Monmouth, 867 adults)  Better: 45% Worse: 28% Same: 23%  The Trump campaign\\'s “law and order” focus and some decline in the number of coronavirus cases have succeeded in raising the salience of a topic Trump prefers. The problem, here and in other polls, is that it\\'s not a clear winner for the president; it\\'s just less rocky for him than the covid-19 response. By a 37-point margin, down from a 42-margin in June, voters say that Trump\\'s response to protests has made the national situation worse; by a 17-point margin, more voters think Biden would have done a better job handling the protests. Democrats live in fear of another protest developing into a violent riot, but nothing so far has advanced the Trump message that unrest now is a preview of “Joe Biden\\'s America.”  Which candidate has the sharpness and stamina to be president? (CNN/SSRS, 787 likely North Carolina voters)  Donald Trump: 50% Joe Biden: 44%  New state polls have produced mostly good news for Biden; he\\'s ahead in every state carried by Hillary Clinton, and in every state Trump won last time by two points or less, the president is trailing. The green shoots are in CNN\\'s question about “sharpness,” a question that has been central to Trump\\'s campaigning even as the message of the week has changed. In both this poll and CNN\\'s poll of Wisconsin, Biden is leading overall and tied or better with Trump when asked who could best tackle crime. The only “issue” lead for the president comes when voters are asked about the candidate\\'s energy and mental strength. That could raise the salience of Biden\\'s Thursday town hall on the network and will definitely raise the stakes in the Sept. 29 debate: The perception of a slow and stumbling Biden is one thing keeping the president in the hunt.  Presidential election in Florida (Monmouth, 428 registered voters)  Joe Biden: 50% Donald Trump: 45%  Last week\\'s Florida polling spurred a Democratic panic over the Latino vote, a source of strength for Hillary Clinton\\'s 2016 campaign that, per NBC/Marist, had moved back to the GOP. Biden\\'s campaign had not taken all the freelance advice offered by Latino strategists — Chuck Rocha, who helped Bernie Sanders win the Latino vote in the primaries, was among the critics — but it had been running Spanish-language ads for months, sparking fresh liberal worries that nothing was working for him. Monmouth\\'s poll finds a very different Florida electorate, almost identical to the 2016 exit polls, which had Clinton winning the state\\'s Latinos by 27 points. The Latino electorate has changed since then, with tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans settling in the state, and Democratic worries are less about converting conservative Cuban American voters than about preventing what happened in 2018: Republicans out-organizing them against the newest Latino voters, erasing Democratic gains elsewhere. Without a shift back, Biden’s resilience with older White voters gives him a lead.  Voting wars  Third-party candidates lost a string of legal challenges over the past week, encouraging Democrats who saw them as threats to winning some key states — something Republicans didn\\'t really dispute, as they helped the challengers.  In Wisconsin, the Green Party lost its ballot access, after the state Supreme Court affirmed that Greens botched their paperwork, failing to update the home address of vice-presidential nominee Angela Walker. That led to hundreds of petition signatures getting tossed, pushing the Greens off the state\\'s ballot for the first time in the national party\\'s history, but the court deemed it necessary to avoid complicating the sending of absentee ballots, which will begin this week. The Greens dawdled in filing their challenge, during which time county clerks began putting the ballots together.  “Even if we would ultimately determine that the petitioners’ claims are meritorious, given their delay in asserting their rights, we would be unable to provide meaningful relief without completely upsetting the election,” wrote the court\\'s majority, with one conservative joining the court\\'s three liberals. “We agree with the [Election] Commission that requiring municipalities to print and send a second round of ballots to voters who already received, and potentially already returned, their first ballot would result in confusion and disarray and would undermine confidence in the general election results.”  The court may still hear a challenge from Kanye West, who was removed from the ballot after evidence showed that the Republican attorney who delivered his paperwork filed it after the deadline. But the rationale provided by the court yesterday suggests that West won\\'t get a pass: Adding his name would force hundreds of thousands of printed ballots to be destroyed or rely on voters who receive them to send them back unused.  Greens have also been tossed from the Montana ballot, where Democrats saw their Senate candidate as a threat to Gov. Steve Bullock, and the Rhode Island ballot, where there\\'s little at stake but the party filed too few petition signatures. They are still on Pennsylvania\\'s ballot, but Democrats have appealed a lower court\\'s decision to the state Supreme Court, where their party has elected a majority of the justices. The situation there is the reverse of the story in Wisconsin: Democrats represent the last impediment to the state sending out its historic number of absentee ballots.  The Greens\\' presidential nominee, Howie Hawkins, has continued to campaign despite the ballot challenges. West, who has made only fitful campaign statements since declaring his bid 10 weeks ago, has said nothing about the lawsuits, delegating that work to attorneys. Unless he gets a respite from another court, the rapper will appear on just 12 ballots, three of them in states where he needed only to pay a fee for access. He\\'ll have been removed from nine state ballots that he applied for, with the reasons ranging from insufficient signatures to, in Arizona, his decision to register as a Republican in his adopted home state of Wyoming, voiding his attempt to appear on the ballot as an independent. Just two states where West made the ballot, Iowa and Minnesota, are being contested by both Trump and Biden.  Candidate tracker  One of the last weeks before the presidential debates began with a fight over climate change, and continued today with something Democrats aren\\'t actually fighting at all: the Trump administration-brokered “Abraham Accords,” under which two Arab nations that were not at war with Israel formalized their peaceful relations.  “We’re here this afternoon to change the course of history,” Donald Trump said at a White House signing ceremony Tuesday afternoon. “After decades of division and conflict, we mark the dawn of a new Middle East.” Joe Biden\\'s campaign has talked little about the accords since initially congratulating the administration for them; the Trump campaign has focused less on the specifics of the accords than on a Norwegian politician nominating the president for a Nobel Peace Prize.  The day before, Trump visited California for a roundtable on the state\\'s response to forest fires while Biden, in Delaware, delivered a speech warning that a second Trump term would lead to policies that make climate change worse. Democrats seized on an exchange between the president and Wade Crowfoot, California\\'s secretary for natural resources.  “If we ignore that science and sort of put our head in the sand and think it’s all about vegetation management, we’re not going to succeed together protecting Californians,” Crowfoot said.  “Okay,” Trump said. “It’ll start getting cooler. You just watch.”  “I wish science agreed with you,” Crowfoot said.  “Well, I don’t think science knows, actually,” Trump said. The next morning, in a long interview with “Fox and Friends,” the president suggested that the lack of forest fires in wetter climates, like Austria\\'s, suggested that climate change was not making fires any worse.  Kamala D. Harris returned to California on Tuesday to survey the damage; Mike Pence campaigned in Wisconsin on Monday. Meanwhile, House Republicans released their “Commitment to America,” a brief but targeted list of policy goals they\\'ll act on if they win. It includes a Marshall Plan for Main Street ($200 billion of small-business loans), a five-year plan for universal broadband access, support for school choice, and a vague promise to shore up Medicare and Social Security.  Countdown', 'Some are reluctant to enter the new site, fearing poor conditions and worried their movement may be further limited.  Names marked with an asterisk* have been changed to protect identities.  Police on the Greek island of Lesbos have launched an operation to rehouse thousands of refugees and migrants who have been sleeping rough after their camp was destroyed by fire.  Officers on Thursday morning woke people in their tents to take them to a temporary centre that was hastily set up after Europe’s largest camp for asylum seekers at Moria burned down last week.  The new Kara Tepe camp, near the island’s main town Mytilene, was made on a former military firing range and is close to the remains of the Moria site.  But many have refused to go, fearing living conditions would be as bad or worse than at Moria, which was notoriously unsafe, and worried they would be left waiting for months to have their requests for asylum processed and transferred to the Greek mainland or another European country.  Riot police and police vans were parked on either side of a street where thousands who fled the Moria camp have been living.  Quietly, with the sounds of children crying and under an already hot sun, people folded their blankets, picked up bags containing whatever belongings they had saved from the fire and dismantled their tents.  More than 12,000 people including entire families with elderly people and newborns were left homeless when fire tore through the overcrowded and unsanitary Moria camp [Elias Marcou/Reuters]  Women and children with bundles on their backs were seen gathering by a barricade police had set up on the road.  Some mothers pushed their babies in prams up the road as other refugees took shelter from the morning sun in the shade of a large building, or washed with water bottles on the roadside.  “The aim is to safeguard public health,” police spokesman Theodoros Chronopoulos told AFP news agency, confirming that “an operation is under way” which “responds to humanitarian aims.”  But Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which opened an emergency clinic in the area, said it was barred from accessing its facility during the night, as rumours of the police operation spread.  “A police operation is under way to take refugees to the new camp. This should not prevent medical aid,” MSF complained on Twitter.  More than 12,000 people including entire families with elderly and newborns were left homeless when fire tore through the overcrowded and unsanitary Moria camp – built five years ago at the height of Europe’s refugee crisis – on the night of September 8.  Thousands have been sleeping under tarpaulins or tents at roadsides and in the car parks of closed supermarkets since the blaze.  Late Wednesday, around 1,000 tents, each able to accommodate between eight and 10 people, had been erected at the new site.  The atmosphere on Thursday morning was calm, with people exhausted from spending a week on the street. Families collected their belongings, some pushing them in large bins or supermarket trolleys, in preparation for the move.  At the start of the operation, single men were not allowed to enter the new camp.  Farhad*, is 20 and alone in Greece, having fled war in Afghanistan.  Even if he was allowed in, he told Al Jazeera he does not want to enter Kara Tepe.  “I’ve been in Moria for nine months and again, if we enter the camp, [maybe] it will be for a year, too. I’m losing my youth just waiting.”  Other families have accepted their new reality.  “We hear there is food and water there,” said Abdul*, who has five children.  His family is tired of living on the street waiting for help that never seems to arrive and believes there is no other option.  Six young Afghans have been arrested in connection with the incident, with four of them brought before a Lesbos magistrate on Wednesday.  A general view of the temporary camp for refugees and migrants near Mytilene town, on the northeastern island of Lesbos, Greece, on September 13 [Petros Giannakouris/The Associated Press]  Medical tents were to be set up, and two quarantine zones were planned for the several dozen people who have tested positive for coronavirus.  “We have seen a lot of people come in hazmat suits trying to talk to people, to convince them to go to the camps. People are moving. Not everyone is moving, but people are moving,” said Al Jazeera’s Stefanie Dekker, reporting from Lesbos.  “A lot of people we have been speaking to this morning still don’t want to go. They say they are hearing the situation is bad, they are are going to be stuck in there, there are calling it a jail.  “Certainly the message from the authorities is that they have to move to the camp, and if they are not going to do so willingly … they will use the police to move people forcefully.”  The Greek migration ministry said on Tuesday that around 1,200 people had entered the new camp.  Aid groups said a few hundred more arrived on Wednesday, forced by exhaustion after sleeping rough under a hot sun for a week.  The UN refugee agency has urged Greece to speed up asylum processes on Lesbos.  “The idea is not that people remain forever on the island of Lesbos, but that processes are accelerated so that people can leave gradually and in an orderly way” to the capital Athens or elsewhere on the mainland, the UN agency’s chief in Greece Philippe Leclerc told reporters.  Meanwhile, anger is growing among local Lesbos residents, who complain overcrowding on the island is affecting its tourism possibilities.  “We have two human dramas here. Unfortunately, it is the drama of the migrants living here that is constantly talked about, and never the locals who have gone through a very hard time, since 2015, and are very frustrated. These people should be put in a controlled camp and far away from the local population,” Moria village resident Stratis Kokkinellis told Al Jazeera.  Greece’s police minister Michalis Chrysochoidis this week said that half the refugees and migrants on Lesbos should be able to leave by Christmas and “the rest by Easter”.  With reporting by Katy Fallon in Lesbos.', 'Editor\\'s Note: This article is adapted from Tucker Carlson\\'s opening commentary from the Oct. 12, 2020 edition of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\"  The first day of Judge Amy Coney Barrett\\'s confirmation hearings were bizarre for one particular reason: Almost none of the attacks on Barrett -- and, of course, there were many of those -- had to do with the job she is trying to get.  The Supreme Court exists only to determine whether the laws that our politicians write are consistent with the Constitution of the United States. That\\'s why we have a Supreme Court. It\\'s the only reason we have it. Supreme Court justices do not make laws because they\\'re not elected by voters. We don\\'t let them legislate as a result. That\\'s how democracy works: Only people who are elected get to make laws.  Democrats would like to change that system. They understand that Congress is an inherently small-c conservative body. Congress is never going to change the country overnight in some radical way because voters don\\'t want radical overnight change. They never do. So if you\\'re going to have a revolution, if you\\'re going to remake America, you\\'re going to have to do it from above. And you\\'re going to have to impose it on people. And the left would like the Supreme Court as their instrument to do that, a kind of super-Congress with lifetime tenure. Imagine power like that. There\\'s nothing you couldn\\'t do.  So once you understand that perspective, which is very much their perspective, Monday\\'s hearing made sense. Democrats spent hours talking about the 2009 ObamaCare law. That was baffling at first. If you\\'re interviewing someone for the Supreme Court, there\\'s only one relevant question about ObamaCare: Is it constitutional? That\\'s all they consider. That\\'s all they\\'re supposed to consider. Not how they feel about the law, not whether it comports with their personal values, not whether their party supports it. Is it constitutional?  And yet that was one of the few things that Democrats didn\\'t ask because they\\'re not interested in whether or not it\\'s constitutional. What they care about is power and whether Amy Coney Barrett will diminish or enhance theirs.  They understand the Supreme Court purely in political terms. So, not surprisingly, they conducted today\\'s hearings like a campaign rally.  \"Health care for millions of Americans is at stake,\" barked one finger-wagging senator from California, another Democrat, pointing to a photo of a middle-aged woman called Laura, who looked very unhappy without ObamaCare. The senator said Laura will be \"unable to afford the treatments necessary for her to survive.\"  In other words, if Amy Coney Barrett gets this job, it\\'s curtains for Laura. Democrat after Democrat made that very same point as they so often have recently: Obey us or many will die.  EIGHT KEY MOMENTS OF AMY CONEY BARRETT\\'S FIRST DAY OF CONFIRMATION HEARINGS  It sounds like ObamaCare is going away if ACB gets on the court, but it\\'s not, actually, and that\\'s the amazing thing: Obamacare isn\\'t really at risk. There is no case currently pending anywhere in this country before any court in America that would eliminate ObamaCare. More importantly, we don\\'t have any idea how Amy Coney Barrett would rule in a case like that were it to materialize, which again, it hasn\\'t.  But most bewildering of all, Democrats themselves have spent most of the past two years publicly conceding that ObamaCare is a disaster. Six of the 10 Democrats currently sitting on the Senate Judiciary Committee co-sponsored Medicare-for-All legislation. That legislation would have completely abolished ObamaCare, along with all private health insurance. Kamala Harris is one of the people who voted for that. And yet there was Kamala Harris Monday warning us that the country will collapse if Amy Coney Barrett votes on a hypothetical case to destroy ObamaCare, which Harris herself voted to destroy.  It all seems kind of confusing, but it begins to make more sense when you realize the goal is not to preserve ObamaCare. Again, they voted to scrap ObamaCare. The goal is to undermine the legitimacy of our system and, in this case, of the Supreme Court so that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris can pack the court full of partisan Democrats who will rubber stamp their program.  Again, it\\'s about power. So that\\'s the key to the riddle when confirmation hearings become partisan political exercises. They make the Supreme Court itself seem like a partisan political exercise, and that degrades the public\\'s trust in the court and their support for our institutions. Democrats know that for the public to go along with court-packing, they have to delegitimize everything about the court and the confirmation process.  ANDY MCCARTHY: \\'NO ONE\\' THINKS SUPREME COURT WILL THROW OUT OBAMACARE IF BARRETT IS CONFIRMED  And so that\\'s what they did again and again Monday. Never mind the fact that the Senate is by definition following every constitutional procedure in filling a Supreme Court vacancy. However, Amy Coney Barrett isn\\'t the outcome that Democrats want. Therefore, our system, they\\'re telling us, is illegitimate.  The irony, of course, is that it\\'s Donald Trump who\\'s undermining our democratic norms. Remember that? They tell you that at every turn. And yet it\\'s not Trump who tried to pack the Supreme Court. He could have tried when Republicans had control of Congress. He didn\\'t consider packing the Supreme Court. Now Democrats are planning to, and it\\'s a familiar path.  Hugo Chavez packed the Supreme Court of Venezuela in 2004. Erdogan did the same in Turkey. How did they do that? How they get their populations to go along with it? By claiming their judicial systems were already illegitimate. Sound familiar?  On Saturday, Joe Biden stumbled through the same rehearsed line you heard from Kamala Harris in the debate last week. Republicans have already packed the court, Joe Biden declared. Yes, we\\'ve had nine justices for more than 150 years. And yet somehow, without anyone noticing, Trump packs the Supreme Court.  BIDEN SPOTLIGHTS OBAMACARE IN SUPREME BATTLE OVER BARRETT  They\\'re the ones violating the Constitution, says Joe Biden. So when I rewrite the Constitution, it\\'ll be fine. That\\'s the predicate. That\\'s the setup for what\\'s coming next. Joe Biden knows Republicans aren\\'t packing the court. He also knows he can repeat that lie with no consequences whatsoever because the media will never hold him to account. They want him to get away with it.  Back in 2013, when it helped Barack Obama, a partisan operation called PolitiFact wrote, \"Court packing [sic] has involved one branch of government proposing to change the structure of the courts, either expanding or decreasing the number of justices.\"  Now, Republicans are not doing that. It\\'s pretty simple. They\\'re not in favor of doing that. If they ever come out in favor of doing it, we will attack them for doing it because we\\'re not partisan. But of course, you won\\'t find a PolitiFact fact check of what Joe Biden just said on Saturday. Instead, our media actually rushed to perpetuate his lies.  This weekend, a piece by the Associated Press referred to court packing -- not sarcastically -- as \"depoliticizing the court.\" You increase the size of the court to dilute the other side\\'s power, you pack it full of partisans who do your bidding, and that\\'s depoliticizing.  AP CALLED OUT FOR ADOPTING DEMOCRATS\\' LANGUAGE ON COURT-PACKING  Here\\'s how the AP put it: \"Montana Senate candidate Steve Bullock said that if Coney Barrett was confirmed, he would be open to measures to depoliticize the court, including adding judges to the bench, a practice critics have dubbed packing the courts\"  No, not critics. Scholars, historians, politicians, Ruth Bader Ginsburg herself. Every person in America referred to court-packing as court-packing up until two weeks ago. It\\'s hard to believe that line made it into print, but it did. Court-packing is just depoliticizing the court now. You\\'ll probably see that definition formalized in the AP\\'s next woke style guide next to their entries on \"undocumented shoppers\" and \"peaceful riots.\"  Fundamentally, though, the AP is onto something, inadvertently. Many judges and justices in this country are obviously political. They have a lot of power, too much power, more power than any individual should have. Power in this country should reside with the electorate. People who are elected should have the most power, not people who are appointed. Unelected judges shouldn\\'t be deciding issues like abortion and immigration policy for the entire country, but they are.  The solution to that is not to embrace more politics in the judicial branch, though, it\\'s to recognize the proper role of the courts, to deescalate a little bit, to bring us a little closer to sanity.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  In a brief moment toward the end of today\\'s hearing, in her opening statement, Amy Coney Barrett tried to do exactly that.  BARRETT: Courts have a vital responsibility to the rule of law, which is critical to a free society. But courts are not designed to solve every problem or right every wrong in our public life. The policy decisions and value judgments of government must be made by the political branches elected by and accountable to the people. The public should not expect courts to do so, and courts should not try.  These hearings will continue for the next couple of days and barring some really dramatic development, it does seem very likely that she\\'ll be confirmed in the end. So there\\'s not a lot of drama, at least as of tonight, surrounding her nomination. What happens to the Supreme Court itself, however, is very much in doubt. And along with it, our country.', 'Some 4.5 million people eligible to vote will cast their ballots for candidates to fill the 130-member chamber.  Voters in coronavirus-battered Jordan will head to the polls on Tuesday to elect a new parliament amid a deepening economic crisis worsened by the pandemic.  With few resources and a high dependency on foreign aid, particularly from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), members of the new parliament will have as their main goal the restructuring of the country’s debt, estimated at more than 100 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP).  Unemployment for the first quarter of 2020 also stands at a staggering 23 percent.  “This vote is different, with people in greater distress because of the epidemic,” Oraib Rintawi of the Al-Quds Center for Political Studies told AFP.  COVID-19 has claimed more than 1,180 lives from more than 104,800 cases in Jordan, according to health ministry data.  However, Rintawi doubted there would be a high turnout because “most Jordanians think parliament plays a marginal role in the political system,” as the formation of governments in the Hashemite kingdom is not party-based or dependent on the outcome of the vote.  There have been some calls on social media to postpone the elections, but the government has said the vote will go ahead.  Parliament was already dissolved in late September ahead of the vote, and under the law, new elections must be held within four months.  Jordanian Minister of Political and Parliamentary Affairs Musa Al-Maaytah insisted on Friday it would be better to hold the vote now rather than in a few months’ time.  “Economic, political and social life must continue,” he added.  King Abdullah II last month named veteran diplomat Bisher al-Khasawneh as prime minister ahead of the vote, after parliament reached the end of its term.  “People will vote along tribal lines for a candidate from their clan or for representatives who will provide them with services,” not for political reasons, Rintawi said.  Some 4.5 million people eligible to vote will cast their ballots for candidates to fill 130 seats in parliament, 15 of them reserved for women, from a field of 1,674 candidates running on 294 lists.  Security forces are also expected to fan out across the country’s 1,880 polling stations.  But virus curbs banning gatherings of more than 20 people have put paid to traditional shows of patronage such as candidates’ tents offering Arabic sweets and coffee.  The Islamic Action Front, the political branch of the Muslim Brotherhood and the main opposition force in Jordan, has pledged “to work to defend people’s rights, dignity and livelihood, and to confront corruption”.  Also in the running for four-year terms in parliament are representatives of the country’s main tribal clans, independents, leftists and a large number of wealthy businessmen.  ‘Poor country’  Jordan has taken an economic hammering from COVID-19 with some $3bn lost in vital tourism revenues in the first nine months of 2020.  Campaigning for the legislative elections was also forced to switch to videos posted on social media platforms, especially Facebook.  Home to some of the world’s finest archaeological sites, including the ancient city of Petra, tourism normally accounts for 14 percent of Jordan’s GDP.  But the industry has been brought to a standstill by the COVID-19 pandemic.  War in the region is further taxing resources. The country is home to some 2.2 million Palestinian refugees and more than 650,000 Syrian refugees, according to the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR.  Jordan estimates the cost of hosting Syrian refugees at about $10bn and regularly complains of a lack of international support.  In March 2020, the IMF approved $1.3bn in aid for Jordan, subsequently adding about $396m in emergency funds to soften the impact of COVID-19.  Saleh al-Armouti, a former Islamist member of parliament, put the focus squarely on economic hardships in a campaign video.  “Our poor country can no longer feed itself because of the hegemony” of the IMF, he said.  Official statistics show the poverty rate has increased to 15.7 percent, a rate which the World Bank forecasts will rise sharply because of the novel coronavirus.', 'A 21-year-old man allegedly murdered by Afghan migrants aboard a bus was stabbed 99 times, according to a Swedish prosecutor.  The prosecutor revealed details while announcing that three Afghan migrants, a man and his two sons, have been charged with the July killing.  Prosecutor Lindha Strömberg said that the stabbing in Kiruna was likely planned and not a random assault.  “He was cycling after work when they attacked him. He then fled in a panic, running through a residential area and, I believe, sought shelter on the bus. They’ve followed him and cut him down,” Strömberg told newspaper Aftonbladet.  Afghan Man and Sons Arrested After Man Stabbed to Death on Bus https://t.co/E3XXHy67ka — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 19, 2020  “It was a massive assault. The coroner found 99 stab wounds,” Strömberg said and added that the victim, 21-year-old Reza Hoseini, had worked at the same business as the wife of the father, a 46-year-old Afghan national.  “The father believed that his wife was having a relationship with the victim. He had been out of work for quite some time. He brought his sons along [to the attack]. I think it indicates an honour motive when you bring family members with you,” prosecutor Strömberg said.  Since their arrest in July, the youngest son confessed to the murder, while the other admitted to assaulting the 21-year-old. The father, meanwhile, has claimed he is innocent of any crime and that the 21-year-old attacked his sons first.  Honour culture and honour-based violence have become a major problem in Sweden in recent years, with a 2017 report claiming that as many as 240,000 young people in the country were subject to honour culture.  In 2016, a murder linked to honour culture that saw a man stab his wife 66 times and cut off her nose and upper lip.  240,000 young people in Sweden with migrant backgrounds live under oppressive ‘honour’ culture. https://t.co/adNIukTC0B — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 30, 2017', 'Somali-American congresswoman is expected to get re-elected by a wide margin in the heavily Democratic fifth district of Minnesota.  Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar is seeking her second term in Congress.  One of the first two Muslim women to be elected to Congress in 2018, Omar, 38, is well-known as a member of the so-called “Squad” of four freshman liberal Democratic congresswomen.  She is also the first Somali-American member of the US Congress.  The candidates  Omar is competing against Republican challenger Lacy Johnson for Minnesota’s Fifth Congressional district.  Michael Moore from the Legal Marijuana Now Party is the third candidate in this race.  Their backgrounds  Omar has built a national profile that started when the one-time refugee from Somalia was elected to the Minnesota Legislature in 2016.  Her aggressive advocacy on liberal issues, anti-Israel comments and eagerness to take on US President Donald Trump have made her even more prominent.  She has frequently become a target of criticism and defamatory comments from the president and other Republicans.  Last month, Omar hit back at Trump, calling him “racist” after he disparaged her during a campaign rally and falsely implied that she is not American.  Omar is vocal in her opposition to other US-foreign allegiances, including the relationship with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  In an interview with Al Jazeera last year, she said: “Our alliedship with Saudi Arabia and the Emirates is immoral. I believe that it is one of the most absurd alliedships; it doesn’t fit with any of our values.”  Meanwhile, her African American GOP rival Johnson is a first-time political candidate.  The 66-year-old is a businessman and entrepreneur with an IT background.  Issues:  Omar is campaigning for a “just immigration system”, providing healthcare coverage for all, guaranteed access to public education and economic justice for working families, according to her website.  On the foreign policy front, she is calling for an end to US military intervention in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen and Somalia.  Her rival Johnson has campaigned for rebuilding the US economy hit by COVID-19, reforming the education system and creating opportunities for the poor and people of colour.  I want to offer my fellow residents a better deal than we have now. Crime rates are on the rise. Ilhan Omar would rather divide us, defund our police, and dismantle our communities.

In 2018, Omar won by 56 points over her Republican challenger.  The last time a Republican won in this district was in 1960.', \"The British government is “actively” considering opening a second migrant camp to house some 250 alleged asylum seekers in Wales, as the illegal boat migration crisis in the UK deepens.  Following the revelation that the Home Office has taken over a former army barracks in Kent to hold some 450 migrants, the Welsh Secretary of State and the MP for South Pembrokeshire and Carmarthen West, Simon Hart, confirmed that the government is considering opening a second camp in a Ministry of Defence facility the small Welsh village of Penally just outside of Tenby.  Mr Hart claimed that the proposed migrant camp would have “minimal impact” on the community, according to Wales Online.  “I have now spoken to the Home Secretary, who is exploring (with a range of partners and Government departments) opportunities for further Covid-19 compliant accommodation for those seeking asylum,” Hart said.  “Following the submission of a request, the Ministry of Defence have commenced scoping options across the UK. One of the sites under active consideration is Penally Training Camp,” he confirmed.  The number of illegal boat migrants recorded to have arrived in September has already set a monthly record, with 1,487 making the journey across the English Channel from France, according to The Telegraph. The record waves of migrants for this month are set to surpass the total number recorded in the whole year of 2019, which was 1,890.  'Asylum seekers' camp objectors gather in force outside the Penally site https://t.co/XAsj5GIl2O pic.twitter.com/8SgUAG5bKl — Western Telegraph (@WTelegraph) September 16, 2020  Hundreds of residents in Penally disagreed with Simon Hart’s claims that the facility will have “minimal impact” on their community. Over 200 members of a group called the ‘Penally Camp Protest’ gathered outside the proposed migrant camp on Tuesday. The group has over 2,200 members on Facebook.  A spokesman for the group, Darren Edmundson, told the Western Telegraph that the group is “concerned for the safety of our family and our children, as we don’t know the background of the asylum seekers”.  “It has been confirmed that (it) is just 250 men. Why not women and children as well?” he questioned.  “We wanted to know the facts etc. It was so disappointing to not see the council or any MPs turn up to answer any questions,” he said, adding: “Simon Hart should have been there.”  Mr Edmundson said that they feel the facility would be better suited to help the local homeless people, saying: “We feel that the camp should have been used to benefit the community.”  Local councillors have also spoken out against the decision. County Councillor Jon Preston accused the government of choosing the location without understanding the local context, an exercise he characterised as “pushing pins in maps without any knowledge of the area.”  According to the latest figures from the National Audit Office (NAO) report, there are some 48,000 supposed asylum seekers receiving support from the British taxpayer as of March of this year. The number is more than double than that recorded in 2012.  The report estimated that the British taxpayer will be on the hook for at least £4 billion by the end of the decade in support payments to the migrants. However, this will likely be much higher in light of the record numbers of illegal boat migrants entering the UK.  400 Migrants to Be Housed in Former Army Barracks ‘Open Camp’ in Kent https://t.co/fWasJklmXE — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 16, 2020  Follow Kurt Zindulka on Twitter here: @KurtZindulka\", 'WASHINGTON — Elizabeth Neumann wrestled with the decision for weeks. She worried about the backlash, the impact it would have on her career, potential threats to her family.  But the former Department of Homeland Security official, who had resigned in April, reached a breaking point after President Donald Trump deployed Homeland Security agents to Portland, exacerbating tensions there. She decided it was worth the risk to speak out against Trump, whom she had come to view as a threat to the country.  “Enough is enough,\" said Neumann, the former assistant secretary of counterterrorism and threat prevention. “People need to understand how dangerous a moment we are in.”  There are plenty of others weighing the same decision.  With just weeks left before the Nov. 3 election, now is the moment of truth for current and former Trump administration officials debating whether they, too, should step forward and join the chorus of Republican voices trying to persuade on-the-fence voters to help deny Trump a second term.  “It’s now or never,\" said Miles Taylor, former chief of staff at DHS, who has been working to recruit others to join the effort. In interviews, Taylor has accused Trump of routinely asking aides to break the law, using his former agency for explicitly political purposes, and wanting to maim and shoot migrants trying to cross the southern border.  “Those who witnessed the president’s unfitness for office up close have a moral obligation to share their assessment with the electorate,\" said Taylor, who launched the group REPAIR — The Republican Political Alliance for Integrity and Reform — to bring together concerned former officials.  A related group, Republican Voters Against Trump, has compiled nearly 1,000 video testimonials from Republicans across the country who want Trump out. Strategic director Sarah Longwell said her goal was to provide a \"permission structure\" to help wavering Republicans feel comfortable opposing Trump.  The effort, she said, grew out of research on “soft” Trump voters.  “While these voters disliked Trump intensely, they didn’t trust the media, they didn’t trust Democrats, they didn’t trust the leaks,” she said. “Who\\'s a credible messenger? It was people like them.”  Other prominent “formers” have spoken out independently — or are considering it.  Former national security adviser John Bolton wrote a scathing book in which he said Trump “saw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed\" on how to run the government. Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis broke a self-imposed vow of silence in June with an op-ed slamming Trump\\'s response to racial justice protests. He and former director of national intelligence Dan Coats also were quoted extensively in a new book by journalist Bob Woodward calling Trump dangerous and unfit for office.  But Mattis and Coats, like former White House chief of staff John Kelly and former national security adviser H.R. McMaster, have refrained from more explicit condemnations, often citing a “duty of silence” or a long tradition of military officials staying out of politics, according to people who\\'ve spoken with them.  Efforts to draw them out are ongoing. While former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen appears disinclined to step forward, there are hopes that former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson might be persuaded to comment and that Coats might be urged to say more. And Kelly, a retired four-star general, is said to be on the fence and torn about the decision.  “I think that he loves his country and he wants to do what’s best for the country,” said Neumann, who served as Kelly’s deputy chief of staff at DHS and is hopeful he\\'ll speak out, even as others don\\'t think it will happen.  Officials like Kelly, with long careers and hefty pensions, would seem to have less to lose by doing so than more junior staffers like Olivia Troye, a former counterterrorism adviser to Vice President Mike Pence who last week joined the campaign against Trump and said she\\'d be voting for Biden.  In a video and interviews, Troye has accused Trump of mishandling the coronavirus and being more concerned about his reelection prospects than saving lives. The White House punched back with an aggressive attack campaign aimed at discrediting her through a barrage of statements, interviews and denunciations from the lectern in the White House briefing room.  “These are not profiles in courage, but these are profiles in cowardice,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said of Troye and Taylor, dismissing them as part of a “fringe club of, quote, ‘Never Trumpers’ who are desperate for relevancy.\"  Taylor said it was clear the White House was “coming after” those who speak out as a warning to others who are considering doing likewise.  “The White House knows if they show this is a very costly thing to do they will scare people from going forward,\" he said.  He added that while more people are still considering coming forward, the White House tactics have worked to some extent — dissuading one senior official who had been on the cusp of speaking out.  Rick Wilson, a longtime Republican strategist who co-founded the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, stressed that time is running out.  “There will be a cottage industry when Trump is out of office of people who say, ‘Oh, I fought from the inside, I fought the good fight, I kept so many bad things from happening.’\" he said. \"It doesn’t matter. There’s only one moment in time where it matters. And that’s now.\"  For Neumann, who describes herself as a conservative Christian and voted for Trump in 2016, the considerations were deeply personal, including what it might mean for her career in a city that puts a premium on loyalty.  \"This is a town based on relationships,” she said. \"And what we have done is, you know, usually not done in this town. Usually you stab people in the back and do it quietly. You do it as an anonymous source. You don’t actually put your name to it.”  Neumann is still out of work and notes that many companies fear making hires that might seem political. But she still said she\\'s been pleasantly surprised by the response overall.  “It was more positive than I expected,\" she said, adding, “No serious threats, haven\\'t had to call the police or anything, so that’s good.”  Anthony Scaramucci, who turned against the president last year after a short stint as White House communications director, has also been in discussions with those on the fence and is using every channel he can find to spread his message, including a new anti-Trump documentary.  “We have to keep the pressure on, and so for me it’s a multimedia approach. It’s radio, it’s podcasts, it’s Twitter, it’s television and it\\'s movies,\" he said. “As a citizen, all I\\'ve tried to do is provide a surgeon general’s warning. ... This guy is a threat to the institutions of democracy, and I worked for him and I think it’s important to send a signal to other people,” he said, that it’s OK to speak out.', 'PARIS — Demonstrators in France on Sunday took part in gatherings in support of freedom of speech and in tribute to a history teacher who was beheaded near Paris after discussing caricatures of Islam’s Prophet Muhammad with his class.  Samuel Paty was beheaded on Friday by an 18-year-old Moscow-born Chechen refugee who was shot dead by police.  Political leaders, associations and unions demonstrated Sunday on the Place de la Republique in Paris holding placards reading “I am Samuel,” that echoed the “I am Charlie” rallying cry after the 2015 attack on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, which published caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad.  Demonstrators also gathered in major cities including Lyon, Toulouse, Strasbourg, Nantes, Marseille, Lille and Bordeaux.  French authorities, meanwhile, say they have detained an 11th person following the killing.  Anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said an investigation for murder with a suspected terrorist motive was opened. At least four of those detained are family members of the attacker, who had been granted 10-year residency in France as a refugee in March, was armed with a knife and an airsoft gun, which fires plastic pellets.  His half-sister joined the Islamic State group in Syria in 2014, Ricard said. He didn’t give her name, and it wasn\\'t clear where she is now.  The prosecutor said a text claiming responsibility and a photograph of the victim were found on the suspect’s phone. He also confirmed that a Twitter account under the name Abdoulakh A belonged to the suspect. It posted a photo of the decapitated head minutes after the attack along with the message “I have executed one of the dogs from hell who dared to put Muhammad down.”  The beheading has upset moderate French Muslims. A group of imams in the Lyon region are holding a special meeting Sunday to discuss together what the group called \"the appalling assassination of our compatriot by a terrorist who in the name of an uncertain faith committed the irreparable.\"  The attack has provoked global condemnation. U.S. President Donald Trump addressed the killing Saturday night from a political rally in Janesville, Wisconsin.  “On behalf of the United States, I’d like to extend my really sincere condolences to a friend of mine, President (Emmanuel) Macron of France, where they just yesterday had a vicious, vicious Islamic terrorist attack — beheading an innocent teacher near Paris,\" he said. “France is having a hard time and Macron’s a great guy.”', 'Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden will give better, cheaper healthcare benefits to illegal aliens than American citizens get, President Trump said in Scranton, Pennsylvania.  “Joe Biden has pledged open borders, free healthcare for illegal aliens — no, not for your … free healthcare for illegal aliens,” Trump said. “They want to give them more than they give us.”  U.S. Customs and Border Protection Chief Mark Morgan said this week that Biden’s undoing of Trump’s pro-enforcement policies will spur an “invasion” of illegal immigration to the United States.  Biden has vowed to amnesty about 11 to 22 million illegal aliens already living in the U.S. in his first 100 days of office. In addition, Biden’s plan would free border-crossers into the interior of the country while they await immigration hearings, give taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal aliens, and restart welfare-dependent legal immigration.  Providing taxpayer-funded healthcare to all illegal aliens would likely drive up costs for American taxpayers at an estimated $23 billion to $66 billion every year. Likewise, experts have said such a policy would spur a giant migration of foreign nationals with serious health problems to the U.S.  Mickey Kaus, a columnist and immigration reformer, said in a recent interview with the Center for Immigration Studies that it would be “very hard” for Biden and Democrats to walk away from providing free healthcare to illegal aliens after they have been promising such a measure.  “It’s very treacherous for the Democrats, but I think they’re pretty much committed to doing it,” Kaus said.  In Pennsylvania, alone, Biden’s plan would provide free healthcare to at least 170,000 illegal aliens, funded by American taxpayers.  John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

The debate topics selected by the bipartisan establishment figures on the commission are listed as “Fighting COVID-19,” “American Families,” “Race in America,” “Climate Change,” “National Security,” and “Leadership.”  The 90-minute debate will be held in Nashville, TN, and will be moderated by Kristen Welker, an NBC News White House correspondent. The commission said the NBC employee selected the debate topics.  The picked moderators ignored immigration — and the linked issues of jobs, wages, innovation, income disparity, and national security — in the first presidential debate, the vice presidential debate, and one of two town halls.  In Trump’s October 15 town hall, he was asked about the fate of 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) illegal aliens who got work permits from President Barack Obama in 2012. But Trump was not asked about immigration’s impact on Americans’ jobs, wages, housing, and society.  Yet immigration is a central factor in all of the non-immigration issues selected for the upcoming debate, said Kevin Lynn, founder of U.S. Tech Workers. He recently helped U.S. workers in Tennesee defeat a corporate effort to outsource their jobs to the H-1B visa workers.  “If you don’t know who is in your country and if you don’t have a culture where everyone is on the same sheet of music … How are you going to trace [contagious people] effectively with a population of illegals?” said Lynn.  He continued:  We know that we built the middle class at a time when we restricted immigration. We restricted it so that immigration policy worked well for Americans, and it worked well for the newcomers. What was going on before we began to restrict immigration in the 1920s? Well, the chambers of commerce would flood the labor market with willing and eager immigrants, only too happy to work for less. In America, when immigrants have arrived, regardless of race, they’ve moved up the economic and social ladder. One group has lagged, and that’s the American Descendants of Slaves (ADOS). The times when ADOS has done better in this country, when they’ve actually made significant advances up the economic and social ladder, were during restricted immigration from the mid-1920s to the mid-1960s. If we want to have a society that is equitable, the most practical solution to create a tight labor market, to make sure that people are not being displaced in the labor force. Eighty-eight percent of our population growth is directly attributable to immigrants and the children of immigrants. As we increase population, we increase the demand for things like housing and infrastructure, and we increase individual carbon footprints. We’re injecting [immigrant] people into a middle-class lifestyle in which just about everything is centered around the automobile. We have in America the second greatest individual carbon footprint of any country — short of the United Arab Emirates — so when you increase the population, you’re increasing our carbon footprint. When you look at U.S. graduates across the United States, they’re being displaced from tech jobs in our financial sector, our insurance sector, our healthcare industry. We have a huge contingent of foreign workers on employment visas working in our federal, state, and local governments. In many of our utilities, like Southern California Edison and Northeast Utilities, they’ve outsourced their technology and other support branches. If they’re not being worked here in the country by foreigners working for H-1B company, they’re being offshored to other countries. And if we think we had an issue when COVID struck in producing personal protective equipment because we had offshored all those manufacturing jobs, then imagine what’s going to happen when we no longer control financial, insurance, healthcare data at the federal level … Talk about national security problems! A real leader looks at the facts and makes the hard decisions. The easy decision is to say that anyone who wants to come to America can come. But 100 years ago, we realized that that did not work well for Americans, and leaders like [Presidents] FDR, Truman, and Eisenhow understood we had to restrict immigration for the benefit of both American and arrivals. We understood the impact that increasing numbers of immigrants have on the economic security of Americans, the national security of Americans, and the environmental impact. A real leader would restrict immigration because that is the best interest of Americans’ society.  Open-ended legal migration is praised by business and progressives partly because the arrival of migrants helps to transfer wealth from wage-earners to stockholders.  Migration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.  Migration also allows investors and CEOs to skimp on labor-saving technology, sideline U.S. minorities, ignore disabled people, exploit stoop labor in the fields, short-change labor in the cities, impose tight controls on American professionals, centralize technological innovation, and undermine labor rights.', 'Brexit Party Leader Nigel Farage was proven right in his prediction that hundreds of illegal boat migrants would make the journey across the English Channel from France on Tuesday, as massive numbers poured into the UK ahead of the changing weather.  At least 300 illegal boat migrants were recorded to have reached the UK on Tuesday, travelling in small rubber boats from France.  A local source told The Telegraph: “It is an absolute deluge today. This is the last window of opportunity before the weather turns. The coastguard have counted in 27 boats, one of which was carrying 32 people.”  On Monday, Brexit leader Nigel Farage predicted that hundreds of migrants would come across the Channel on Tuesday, adding that if he was aware of the massive flood of migrants, then surely the British and French authorities would be as well.  He went on to question if anyone on the British or French side would “lift a finger” to stop the “invasion”.  “Let’s see whether my prediction’s right and let’s see whether anybody has lifted a finger, otherwise we’ll get another army camp full tomorrow,” he proclaimed.  ‘Will Anybody Lift A Finger?’ Farage Predicts Hundreds of Boat Migrants Will Set Off on Tuesday https://t.co/A8RssPrhOQ — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 22, 2020  The latest crossings take the official number of illegal boat migrants to over 6,400, more than triple the number that was recorded in 2019.  The first boat was recorded at 4 in the morning, with migrants landing on Shakespeare Beach in Dover. By 8 am the British Border Force had to start collecting migrants in lifeboats as the main vessels had already reached their capacities.  So far, September has been the busiest month for illegal migrant crossings, with migrant numbers quickly approaching 2,000, with one week left to go in the month.  The current record for one day of crossings was set earlier this month when 416 illegal aliens reached British shores on September 2nd.  The massive wave of migrants on Tuesday comes as the Home Office relocated some 400 supposed asylum seekers to an open camp established in the Napier Barracks in Folkstone, Kent. On Monday evening, the first of the migrants were seen entering the camp.  A second migrant camp in the Penally Army Centre is also being considered by the Home Office, as it struggles to house the record numbers of migrants. It is believed that some 250 migrants will be housed in the camp.

He made his Hebrew-language remarks at a press briefing from Tel Aviv a day after the U.S. president announced that Sudan would normalize ties with Israel while on the phone with the two leaders.  During the Oval Office phone call, which was attended by reporters and Trump’s Middle East peace team including senior advisor Jared Kushner and envoy to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict Avi Berkowitz, Trump asked Netanyahu, “Do you think Sleepy Joe would have made this deal? Somehow, I don’t think so.”  Netanyahu, avoiding a partisan response, answered diplomatically, “Well, Mr. President, one thing I can tell you. We appreciate the help for peace from anyone in America, and we appreciate what you’ve done enormously.”  “Do you think Sleepy Joe could have made this deal, Bibi? Sleepy Joe?” Trump asked Netanyahu Look at the answer 👇 https://t.co/WWhTLB0h7P pic.twitter.com/2EdKwWdUUm — Stop Bullying Israel (@StopBullyingIsr) October 24, 2020  An Israeli reporter asked Netanyahu the next day if Trump had “embarrassed” him by dragging him into the U.S. election debate.  “You know, it’s very difficult to embarrass me,” Netanyahu responded.  The Channel 13 reporter also asked if Democratic candidate Joe Biden would prevent or at least delay any future normalization agreements during the transition period and if Netanyahu was concerned that a Democratic win would mean Israel will receive the “cold shoulder” after “putting all its eggs” in the Republican basket.  “The bipartisan support of both the Republicans and the Democrats is very important to Israel,” Netanyahu said. “I have always cooperated with U.S. presidents. Sometimes I agree with their policies and sometimes not – and that’s the case with Republicans and Democrats alike.”  But he went on to say that it was under Trump’s leadership that the normalization deals with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and most recently, Sudan, were established.  “That’s a fact,” he said. “And we are very appreciative of that.”  “I think the that that appreciation cross many of the parties in Israel and many people appreciate it – as well as I,” he added.

He went on to say that while he wasn’t interested in “predicting the outcome of the elections one way or another, I hope this policy [of normalization] will continue because it’s the right one.”  Netanyahu said that while he had always believed in a policy of peace with the Arab world, he couldn’t always convince others of the same.  “We had to take a lot of clandestine steps [towards normalization] many of which weren’t revealed, sometimes not even to the U.S., but they proved themselves,” he said.  “I’m happy that the U.S. joined this effort and today is leading it, it’s a very important thing because it leads to peace.”  Addressing the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Netanyahu said the core issue was that the Palestinians refuse to “abandon their delusional demands that will bring an end to Israel and that no rational [Israeli] government would agree to.”  One of the main sticking points of the conflict is the Palestinian “the right of return” in which Palestinian refugees and their descendants — who number in the millions — would be allowed to return to their original homes in Israel – a demand that would effectively spell the end of the Jewish state by demographic means.  President Donald Trump on Tuesday at an ABC News town hall promised peace in the Middle East without losing American soldiers in unwinnable wars. https://t.co/EiJIkYaqKw — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) September 16, 2020  According to the Israeli premier, the Palestinians will only give up those demands “once they see that the whole Arab world is making peace with Israel.”  “That is to say, it is not a breakthrough with the Palestinians that will bring peace with the Arab world. The opposite is true: peace with the Arab world will bring peace with the Palestinians.”  He concluded by reiterating his hope that the next administration would continue on the same path.', 'A New York grocery store owner is facing boycott threats because he offered a 20% discount to Trump supporters – even after he said he would honor the deal for Biden backers, too.  The Fresh Food Supermarket in Oakdale, N.Y., advertised the offer on Facebook Wednesday with a graphic that said customers could get a discount if they mentioned their support for President Trump at checkout. Beer was excluded.  The store’s owner, Jose Colon, a Dominican Republic native who is now a U.S. citizen, said he received immediate blowback, as social media users threatened to boycott and make calls to local health inspectors.  “We’re supposed to live in a free country,” Colon told Fox News. “This is weird. It’s crazy.”  NEW YORK RESTAURANT OWNER CANCELED FOR FLYING TRUMP FLAG  There was no similar post as of Thursday afternoon about a deal for former Vice President Joe Biden\\'s supporters, but Colon said he would honor the same discount.  “We live in a free country where we support democracy, where we can go both ways, we can support left, right -- whatever you want,” Colon said. “I decided to vote and support the best interest, I believe, for this country.”  “But at the same time, I meant to post, to do the 20%, also for Biden,” he added.

If confirmed, Barrett, a conservative jurist appointed by Trump in 2017 to the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals, will certainly tilt the high court further rightward for years to come.  Here are some of Barrett\\'s most notable writings:  Second Amendment  In 2019, Barrett dissented alone when a 7th Circuit panel majority rejected a Second Amendment challenge from a man found guilty of felony mail fraud and prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal and Wisconsin law.  \"History is consistent with common sense: it demonstrates that legislatures have the power to prohibit dangerous people from possessing guns,\" she wrote in Kanter v. Barr, applying an originalist approach that looked to the 18th-century intentions. \"But that power extends only to people who are dangerous. Founding legislatures did not strip felons of the right to bear arms simply because of their status as felons.\"  Barrett concluded, \"Holding that the ban is constitutional ... does not put the government through its paces, but instead treats the Second Amendment as a second-class right.\"  Public charge  In June, Barrett dissented as a 7th Circuit panel left intact a US district court decision temporarily blocking a Trump policy that disadvantaged green card applicants who apply for any public assistance. In dispute were federal immigration regulations regarding when an applicant would be deemed a \"public charge\" and ineligible for permanent status in the US.  In her dissent, Barrett wrote that the Trump administration\\'s interpretation of the relevant \"public charge\" law was not \"unreasonable.\"  \"At bottom, the plaintiffs\\' objections reflect disagreement with this policy choice and even the statutory exclusion itself. Litigation is not the vehicle for resolving policy disputes. Because I think that DHS\\'s definition is a reasonable interpretation of the statutory term \\'public charge,\\' I respectfully dissent,\" she wrote.  The 7th Circuit majority in Cook County v. Wolf countered that Barrett\\'s construction failed to take account of the immigrants who would \"bear the brunt of the\" new rule.  Abortion  In 2018, when the full 7th Circuit declined to reconsider a dispute over an Indiana abortion regulation requiring that the post-abortion fetal remains be cremated or buried, Barrett dissented with fellow conservatives. They began by focusing on a more contentious provision that had been earlier invalidated and not subject to the appeal.  That provision made it unlawful for physicians to perform an abortion because of the race, sex or disability of the fetus. Barrett joined a dissent written by Judge Frank Easterbrook referring to the law as a \"eugenics statute.\"  \"None of the Court\\'s abortion decisions holds that states are powerless to prevent abortions designed to choose the sex, race, and other attributes of children,\" the dissent added.  Affordable Care Act  In an early 2017 law review essay , reviewing a book related to the Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act, Barrett criticized Chief Justice John Roberts\\' rationale that saved the law in 2012.  \"Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute,\" Barrett wrote. \"He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power.\"  At another point, Barrett refers to \"Roberts\\' devotion to constitutional avoidance.\"  The court is scheduled to take up the latest challenge to Obamacare on November 10.  This story has been updated with additional developments.', 'Although he lost his reelection bid, President Trump saw his support among Hispanic voters grow by about four points nationally over his 2016 performance, winning the backing of about a third of these voters, according to exit polls. Plenty of evidence points to the extreme position on abortion embraced by Democrats as a primary cause of the shift.  As “pro-life for the whole life” Democrats, we worry that this shift could intensify in future elections, especially for Republican candidates with positions on immigration more moderate than Trump’s.  Abundant polling confirms the importance of abortion to Hispanic voters — especially Hispanic Catholics.  LOUISIANA VOTERS APPROVE AMENDMENT STATING ABORTION IS NOT A RIGHT IN STATE CONSTITUTION  In the election just concluded, Trump made the strongest gains among Hispanic communities dominated by recent immigrants and religious voters. At a localized level, Biden suffered stunning drops in Hispanic support across the nation compared to vote totals Hillary Clinton received four years ago: 9 points in El Paso County in Texas, 19 points in Texas’ Cameron County, 23 points in Texas’ Hidalgo County, and 23 points in the overwhelmingly Hispanic Miami-Dade County in Florida.  In Starr County in Texas there was a remarkable 55-point swing from Clinton in 2016 to Trump in 2020.  Bordering Mexico, Starr County is 96% Hispanic, dominated by Mexican Americans, as well as 75% Catholic. Starr County’s Republican Party chair attributed the dramatic swing in the small rural county at least in part to the fact that the county is “very pro-life.”  If Starr County’s Hispanic Catholics are anything like those nationwide, almost one in three say they will only vote for a candidate who shares their pro-life views.  The simplest explanation for Clinton voters becoming Trump voters this year? Democrats brought the most extreme abortion platform in history to America’s most pro-life demographic group.  Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris of California — now president-elect and vice president-elect — have promised taxpayer-funded abortion on demand. The official Democratic Party platform, moreover, makes zero mention of any restrictions or regulations on abortions.  Hispanic Americans are overwhelmingly pro-life. They are the only ethnicity that believes abortion should be mostly or always illegal, as well as the only ethnicity to have become more pro-life in the past five years.  President Trump knows this, which is why he campaigned aggressively on a pro-life message among Latino voters.  From his launch of Evangelicals for Trump at a Miami megachurch to a rally targeted at Hispanic voters two days before the election, the message of abortion was front and center for the president.  Polling shows the effectiveness of pro-life messaging with Hispanic voters. In 2014, the Texas Gubernatorial Project found that just one pro-life video advertisement could shift Hispanic voters 13 points away from a pro-choice Democrat to a pro-life Republican.  Of course, it’s difficult to generalize about a population as diverse as Hispanic Americans. Undoubtedly, the GOP’s message of the “socialist” threat posed by the Biden-Harris campaign resonated with Cuban Americans. At the same time, that explanation can’t account for the even wilder swing seen among Mexican Americans in Texas.  The most straightforward explanation is that values matter. Hispanic voters aren’t blind to the abortion extremism in the Democratic Party platform. The huge gap between their values and those represented in the Democratic platform matter.  We’re delighted that President-elect Biden will usher in a return to humane immigration policies, action on climate change, and will work to heal systemic racism.  But we worry about the future of the Democratic Party. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., was right when she said that “when it comes to Latinos the party’s just never seriously made an effort.”  CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER  The Democratic Party and Planned Parenthood have been pitching losing rhetoric — not actual policies — to Hispanic voters for years.  This rhetoric is disturbing: it holds that it’s not enough that Latinas are twice as likely to have an abortion as White women. We’re told that the ratio needs to be even higher, in the name of addressing “health disparities” in abortion access.  Hispanic leaders have spoken out loud and clear against Planned Parenthood’s targeting of their community.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  When it comes to abortion, the Democratic Party pays lip service to “intersectionality” by lauding BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People of Color) reproductive health leaders and pledging to address the gap in access to abortion.  But the truth is that the Democratic Party can only win these voters back by listening. And when it does listen, it might not like what these voters have to say.  Xavier Bisits is national operations director of Democrats for Life.', 'Seventeen years after it was born with the help of the CIA seed money, data-mining outfit Palantir Technologies is finally going public in the biggest Wall Street tech offering since last year’s debut of Slack and Uber.  Never profitable and dogged by ethical objections for assisting in the Trump administration’s deportation crackdown, Palantir has forged ahead with a direct listing of its stock, which is set to begin trading on Wednesday. In its stock offering, the company is not selling newly minted shares to raise money; it is simply listing existing shares for public trading.  The low-key strategy may not generate the enthusiasm many technology offerings do. But it is in character for a secretive company long reliant on spies, police and the military as customers – and whose founders are holding onto voting control of the company.  The big question for both investors and company management: Can Palantir successfully transition from a business built on the costly handholding of government customers to serving corporate customers at scale? The company is a hybrid provider of software and consulting services that often embeds its own engineers with clients.  Analysts say its future depends on selling multinationals its tools for gathering disparate data from an ever-expanding data universe and using artificial intelligence technology to find previously undetectable patterns. Those can theoretically guide strategic decisions and identify new markets much as they have aided in tracking rebel fighters and sorting military intelligence.  The company sets itself apart from most US technology providers, and just moved its headquarters to Denver from Silicon Valley. Palantir colours itself patriotic and belittles other tech firms that would not unquestionably support US dominance in war-fighting and intelligence.  “Our software is used to target terrorists and to keep soldiers safe,” CEO Alex Karp wrote in a letter accompanying Palantir’s offering prospectus. While Karp acknowledged the ethical challenge of building software that “enables more effective surveillance by the state”, Palantir’s prospectus touts its work helping US soldiers counter roadside bombings and fight the ISIL (ISIS) group.  But investors also have to reckon with the Peter Thiel factor.  The iconoclastic entrepreneur and PayPal co-founder endorsed President Donald Trump in 2016, worked on his transition team and holds the largest chunk of Palantir stock. Thiel already exerts tremendous power from the board of Facebook, which dominates global media and seeks to create a digital currency.  In its IPO prospectus, Palantir paints a dark picture of faltering government agencies and institutions in danger of collapse and ripe for rescue by a “central operating system” forged under Thiel’s auspices. As the offering is structured, Thiel will be the dominant voice among the Palantir co-founders who will retain voting control.  “Is that someone who you want deciding how a component of the [national] security apparatus is designed?” asked New York University business professor Scott Galloway. “If you believe that power corrupts and checks and balances are a good idea, this is just from the get-go a really bad idea.”  Earlier in September, BuzzFeed reported that Thiel hosted a known white nationalist, Kevin DeAnna, at a 2016 dinner party, citing emails it obtained and published whose authors refused to talk to the online news outlet. Thiel declined through a spokesman to discuss the report with The Associated Press news agency. Critics say he shares the blame for Facebook’s incomplete removal of toxic disinformation disseminated by the pro-Trump far-right fringe.  Then there are Palantir’s fundamentals, which Galloway considers lousy. The company has just 125 customers in 150 countries, including Airbus, Merck, Credit Suisse and the Danish National Police. Slightly less than half its 2019 revenues were from government agencies, and three clients – which Palantir did not name – accounted for almost a third of revenues.  “They’re massively unprofitable and they’ve never been able to figure it out,” Galloway said, noting that it took Google three years to earn a profit, and Amazon seven. Over a much longer span, Palantir has accumulated $3.8bn in losses, raised about $3bn and listed $200m in outstanding debt as of July 31.  As the Palantir offering is structured, Peter Thiel will be the dominant voice among the Palantir co-founders who will retain voting control [File: Ben Margot/AP Photo] Palantir, named for the mystical all-seeing stones from Tolkien’s “Lord of The Rings”, has recently been deepening its relationship with Uncle Sam, including winning a modest contract early in the COVID-19 pandemic for helping the White House gather data on the coronavirus’s impact.  Senior emerging technology analyst Brendan Burke of Pitchbook says he is not worried that Thiel’s association with Trump will hurt the company if Trump loses the election.  “The political connections don’t appear to be the main driver of their recent substantial contract wins,” he said, although he noted that government contracts can be more volatile than corporate ones, where Palantir’s foothold is less firm.  Palantir offers two software platforms. Foundry is designed to link disparate and largely incompatible data sources into a central operating system. It is the company’s primary hope for broadening its business.  An earlier product, Gotham, has been used by defence and intelligence analysts and police departments to identify patterns deep within datasets. But the value of “predictive policing” tools developed with the platform have been questioned for their potential to unfairly target people of colour. The New Orleans and New York City police departments, once customers, have used it.  A 2017 research paper by University of Texas sociologist Sarah Brayne, who studied the Los Angeles Police Department’s use of Gotham, found the software could lead to a proliferation of unregulated personal data collected by police from commercial and law enforcement databases.  On Monday, Amnesty International issued a briefing that says Palantir is failing to conduct human rights due diligence around its contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, calling it “deeply ironic” that the company crows about its determination not to work with regimes like China that abuse human rights.  Palantir’s ICE contracts involve the maintenance and improvement of two products used in deportation raids. One of them, its web-based Falcon tool, has enhanced data accessible to investigators “involving the illegal movement of people into, within, and out of the United States”, according to documents obtained by the AP, including court records, and by the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center in a freedom-of-information request.  Palantir has acknowledged in its SEC filing that “unfavorable coverage in the media” and from social activists could hurt its business. It also says its contractual obligations might prevent it from being able to defend its actions publicly, although it recently named a former Wall Street Journal reporter to its board.  Negative publicity over ICE contracts may also have hurt company recruitment on college campuses.', 'Populist Italian Senator Matteo Salvini was the victim of a physical attack, reportedly by a politically left-wing migrant during a campaign event ahead of the regional elections in the traditional leftist stronghold of Tuscany.  The attack took place in the commune of Pontassieve on Wednesday, with the woman tearing at the League leader’s shirt and his rosary.  Guglielmo Picchi, former deputy minister of foreign affairs, labelled the attacker as an Antifa militant. He said: “Salvini was attacked in Pontassieve by a mobster anti-fascist militant who ripped at his shirt and rosary. The true Democrat [Party].”  According to a report from newspaper Il Giornale, the attacker is a 30-year-old migrant from the Congo. Witnesses added that she is employed by the local government and was on her way back from work when she attacked Salvini.  Salvini commented on the attack later in the day, saying: “I can buy a new shirt. But the rosary ripped violently from my neck — that had been given to me by a parish priest — unfortunately not.”  Salvini-Backed Candidate Leads in Leftist Stronghold Ahead of Election https://t.co/G8UdzEaM67 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 4, 2020  “To this anger, I answer with a smile and with my work. Long live the Italy of women and men who believe in freedom, serenity, and work,” he said. He added that he felt sad for the woman who attacked him, rather than angry.  When asked what he thought would be the result of the seven upcoming regional elections this month, Salvini said: “Is 7-0 for regionals an exaggeration? No, I feel like there’s a desire for change.”  Salvini’s centre-right coalition candidates are ahead in many regions in recent polls, including some that have been leftist strongholds for decades.  The former interior minister, who led a campaign against mass migration and migrant transport NGOs, has been the target of threats from Antifa militants for years, including death threats.  In 2018, leftist militants at the University of Bologna put up posters advocating for the assassination of Salvini. Last year, an unknown person sent the League leader a bullet in the post.  Death Threat: Salvini Blames Left After Receiving Bullet in Envelope https://t.co/XyZl4hHibG — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) July 13, 2019', 'President Donald Trump is gaining support from younger Latino and black voters, contradicting the roar of claims by establishment groups that he and his policies are racist.  Trump “gained among voters of color, especially Hispanic voters and younger Black voters,” says an October 19 report by Fivethirtyeight.com, a firm that tracks public attitudes on many issues. “Trump is attracting 35 percent of Hispanic voters under age 45, up from the 22 percent who backed him four years ago,” the site said.  The group “moving most toward Democrats since 2016 are more high income and white [and] the groups moving toward Trump are more low-income and minority,” according to Derek Thompson, a writer at the pro-establishment the Atlantic magazine who reviews data collected by the Pew Research Center. This means that the electorate is slowly “depolarizing on race … polarizing around education rather than income,” he wrote.  “Trump’s position has improved relative to 2016 with a number of non-White groups, including Black women, Hispanic men, and two non-White religious groups,” the Washington Post reported on October 9. “This has been a concerted focus of Trump’s, with constant appeals to both groups. He’s made headway, which could help in a close election, either by dampening turnout for Biden or reducing Biden’s margins with the groups.”  The reports skirted around the possible reasons for Trump’s rising support among minorities. Notably, the articles did not mention Trump’s curbs on blue-collar illegal migration, which pressure employers to hire young Americans — of all colors — at higher wages.  But the gain among minorities seems to match the immigration policy change. For example, the shift towards Trump is occurring among younger male voters, says fivethirtyeight.com:  Trump’s support among young Black voters (18 to 44) has jumped from around 10 percent in 2016 to 21 percent in UCLA Nationscape’s polling. … For instance, an early-July African American Research Collaborative poll of battleground states found that 35 percent of 18-to-29-year-old Black adults agreed that although they didn’t always like Trump’s policies, they liked his strong demeanor and defiance of the establishment. Conversely, just 10 percent of those 60 and older said the same. It’s a similar story with younger Hispanic Americans, a group where Trump has also made gains. According to UCLA Nationscape’s polling, Trump is attracting 35 percent of Hispanic voters under age 45, up from the 22 percent who backed him four years ago in the CCES data.  Many polls show that the public welcomes legal migrants — but also much prefers that new jobs go to Americans first. In April 2020, a Washington Post poll showed that 69 percent of Hispanics said yes when they were asked, “Would you support … temporarily blocking nearly all immigration into the United States during the coronavirus outbreak?” Just 30 percent of Hispanics oppose the border shutdown.  Joe Biden’s 2020 plan promises to let companies import more visa workers, to let mayors import temporary workers, to accelerate the inflow of chain-migration migrants, to end migration enforcement against illegal aliens unless they commit a felony, and to dramatically accelerate the inflow of poor refugees to at least 125,000 per year.  In contrast, Trump’s 2020 plan offers broadly popular — but quite limited — pro-American restrictions on migration and visa workers.  Open-ended legal migration is praised by business and progressives partly because the arrival of migrants helps to transfer wealth from wage-earners to stockholders.  Migration moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.  Migration allows investors and CEOs to skimp on labor-saving technology, sideline U.S. minorities, disregard workplace discrimination rules, ignore disabled people, exploit stoop labor in the fields, short-change labor in the cities, impose tight control on American professionals, centralize technological innovation, and undermine many types of labor rights.', 'Homeless Bulgarian migrant Blagovest Hadjigueorguiev admitted setting fire to a police officer last month who tried to evict him from land belonging to Prince Charles.  Appearing before Truro Crown Court on Tuesday, the 30-year-old admitted to committing an act of grievous bodily harm with intent against PC Darral Mares and attempted grievous bodily harm with intent towards PC Alen Lenton.  On September 11th, police officers responded to a call for help from bailiffs struggling to evict the Bulgarian who had been staying illegally on property belonging to the Duchy of Cornwall in Newquay. He had strewn the field with plastic tents and had hung his bags from trees, according to the BBC.  On arrival, officers tried to engage with Hadjigueorguiev and ask him to leave the area, before he began to brandish a bottle of flammable liquid.  CornwallLive reported police bodycam footage as showing Hadjigueorguiev asking the police officers where they were from, if they were Cornish, and why they had tasers. After responding that they had the tasers for protection, the migrant claimed he had the volatile liquid for his own protection, telling the officers: “You came here to be a piece of sh*t for no reason.  “You are stepping on my tent, destroying my stuff and being a vandal you stupid sh*t.”  Hadjigueorguiev then threw the accelerant at 51-year-old PC Mares and ignited it, resulting in the Army veteran suffering serious burns to his arms and legs.

His colleagues were able to put out the flames and call an ambulance. While the injuries were not life-threatening, he is still said to be recovering from his injuries which local media described as life-changing.  Local media described 51-year-old PC Mares as popular and that he had been in the police force for 18 years. The judge adjourned sentencing until next month to receive an updated impact statement from the victim, with the judge telling the Bulgarian on Tuesday that he should be “under no illusions that you are facing an extremely lengthy prison sentence for this attack”.  In another case involving violence against police, on Monday 26-year-old Aydin Altun was found guilty of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm after ploughing his car into a policeman while driving at speed, the officer, for several seconds, clinging to the car’s hood. Altun had claimed that he did not intend to hurt PC Lewis Crowder, but became frightened when he saw armed police attempting to stop and question him in relation to a London shooting the night before. The jury cleared Altun of the shooting.  Last month, London Met custody Seargent Matiu (Matt) Ratana was fatally shot while on duty, the 54-year-old being less than two years away from retirement.  While in July, Henry Long, Albert Bowers, and Jessie Cole were imprisoned after being found guilty of the manslaughter of Thames Valley Police Constable Andrew Harper. In August 2019, PC Harper was dragged for more than a mile to his death after his leg had become snagged in the tow rope of the convicts’ car. The officer had suspected the males of the theft of a quadbike. The three youths had a long history of stealing.', 'A group of Republican senators is asking the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to review the cost to Americans of a Democrat plan that provides United States jobs, stimulus checks, and taxpayer-funded health care to illegal aliens.  In May and this month, House Democrats passed two versions of the “HEROES Act,” (which offers amnesty to several million illegal aliens who can be deemed as working “critical infrastructure” jobs in the U.S. and thus cannot be deported.  The Democrats’ first version of the HEROES Act (H.R. 6800) offered a similar amnesty — giving businesses the ability to hire cheaper illegal aliens for scarce U.S. jobs even as tens of millions of Americans remain unemployed.  Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), and Mike Lee (R-UT) have sent a letter to the CBO asking for a review of the impact the HEROES Act’s amnesty and illegal immigration enticements would have on Americans in the workforce and on their pocketbooks.  “It’s time the American people have a fuller understanding of exactly how much Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi’s policies will cost them,” the Sesators write. “While we have estimates of how much H.R. 6800 may cost in total, we believe Congress must know the costs of the specific provisions providing benefits to illegal immigrants.”  The full letter can be read here:  Senator Letter to CBO by John Binder  RJ Hauman with the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), which fights for a reduction in foreign competition against American workers, applauded the senators’ efforts:  It’s encouraging to see a group of Republican Senators not only reinforce the fact that HEROES Act 2.0 is dead on arrival but shine a light on the Democratic Party’s radical immigration agenda — illegal aliens and shady employers first, hardworking American taxpayers last. We’re hopeful that if several of them are re-elected, they’ll go beyond this and fight for reforms that address the root causes of illegal immigration. And not only that, but work to ensure that our deeply flawed legal immigration system finally serves the best interests of American workers and the nation as a whole.  Mass immigration has direct impacts on the nation’s working and middle class, who are forced to compete for U.S. jobs with millions of newly arrived illegal and legal immigrants every year. Annually, the current immigration system gives green cards to about 1.2 million mostly low-skilled foreign nationals and work visas to another 1.4 million foreign nationals.  Though the big business lobby and corporate interests claim that the labor pool must be expanded to provide them with a never-ending flow of foreign workers, between 20 to 30 million Americans today remain unemployed, underemployed, or out of the labor force, though all want full-time jobs.  In a state like Florida, where immigrants make up about 25.4 percent of the labor force, American workers have their weekly wages reduced by perhaps 12.5 percent.  President Trump’s agenda, opposed by business and corporate interests, has sought to tighten the U.S. labor market through increased immigration enforcement and an overall reduction to immigration, which, in return, has delivered jobs and higher wages to working- and middle-class Americans.  In June, a Zogby Analytics poll for FAIR revealed huge popularity for reducing overall immigration among swing-state voters. Majorities between 56 to 64 percent in Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona, Maine, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, and Wisconsin said they support reducing immigration, specifically while tens of millions of Americans are jobless.

The first presidential debate was a fast-moving clash of personalities – with a lot of clutter and confusion.  The vice-presidential debate can move more slowly and be more informative in clarifying the difference between the two tickets.  The contrast between Vice President Mike Pence’s Indiana conservatism and Sen. Kamala Harris’s San Francisco radicalism is so great that this should be a debate focused on issues far more than personalities. The stage is set for a truly historic encounter.  LIZ PEEK: 2020 VP DEBATE – WHY THIS ONE MATTERS MORE THAN MOST  Vice President Pence believes in the historic America of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and American history. Sen. Harris is allied with the radicals who want to dramatically change America and who repudiate the Founding Fathers and the basic events which created America.  Harris’s radicalism was obvious when she said to Steven Colbert about the demonstrations and riots:  “They\\'re not going to stop … this is a movement. I\\'m telling you, … they\\'re not going to stop before election day in November, and they\\'re not gonna stop after election day. And that should be -- everyone should take note of that on both levels -- that this isn\\'t – they\\'re not going to let up and they should not. And we should not.”  When the Los Angeles mayor cut $150 million from the city police budget Harris said, “I applaud Eric Garcetti for doing what he\\'s done.”  By contrast, Vice President Pence strongly favors supporting police and locking up criminals.  He has worked with President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr on Operation LeGend and other federal efforts to arrest and prosecute violent criminals.  Meanwhile, Harris supports efforts to get criminals out of jail. In June, Harris advocated for the public to fund bail for arrested suspects implicated in the George Floyd riots in Minneapolis. \"If you’re able to, chip in now to the @MNFreedomFund to help post bail for those protesting on the ground in Minnesota,\" Harris tweeted.  Vice President Pence favors prosecutors who enforce the law. Sen. Harris supports George Soros-funded district attorneys who are pro-criminal and anti-police.  When she was asked about her support for convicted felons and other prisoners voting from jail – and whether that would include the Boston Marathon Bomber while he is on appeal from his death sentence – she refused to rule it out, saying, “I think we should have that conversation.”  Vice President Pence is strongly pro-life while Sen. Harris is committed to repealing the Hyde Amendment which protects taxpayers from having to pay for abortion. She would support tax paid abortions – and it is not clear if that would include in the ninth month as many Democrats advocate.  Vice President Pence is a strong supporter of the right to bear arms and the Second Amendment. Sen. Harris has a robust plan for dramatically limiting the right to own guns.  Vice President Pence strongly supports constitutional conservative judicial nominees for federal courts and has supported all three of President Trump’s pro-constitution nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Sen. Harris was the most vicious questioner of now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings. She has opposed all three conservative nominees.  She and Vice President Joe Biden refuse to issue a list of the kind of justices they would appoint to the Supreme Court.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER  Parallel to their opposite positions on judges, Vice President Pence believes in protecting our religious liberties under the First Amendment while Sen. Harris would sue nuns for not supporting a pro-abortion agenda.  Harris’ hostility to Catholics came out when she challenged one court nominee about his membership in the Knights of Columbus. She implied that if he was a faithful Catholic, he couldn’t serve on the Court. She is simply the most bigoted anti-Catholic nominee of a major party since the late 19th century.  Vice President Pence supports school choice and parents’ right to send their children to a good school. Sen. Harris is deeply opposed to school choice and favors a teachers’ union run bureaucratic school monopoly.  Vice President Pence is a strong supporter of hydraulic fracturing, which has given America energy independence, created millions of jobs, and lowered the cost of energy.  Sen. Harris on CNN said “There\\'s no question I\\'m in favor of banning fracking, so yes. And starting -- and starting with what we can do on day one around public lands, right? And then there has to be legislation, but yes -- and this is something I\\'ve taken on in California. I have a history of working on this issue. And to your point, we have to just acknowledge that the residual impact of fracking is enormous in terms of the impact on the health and safety of communities.”  Finally, where Vice President Pence is for enforcing our immigration laws, Sen. Harris is for eliminating criminal charges for entering the United States without permission. As she put it on CNN after one of the Democratic primary debates, “it should be a civil enforcement issue, but not a criminal enforcement issue.”  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Furthermore, she would provide government health care and free education for all immigrants in the country illegally, asserting “I\\'m opposed to any policy that would deny in our country, any human being from access to public safety, public education, or public health period.”  The gap between the conservative vice president and the radical senator from San Francisco is so great this could be a tremendously powerful clash of ideas and policies.

The emergency declaration — challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union, Texas Civil Rights Project, Center for Gender & Refugee Studies, and Oxfam — was invoked in March under the Public Health Service Act.  The Trump administration used it to deport thousands of minors, arguing in court that it must do so during the pandemic to prevent infecting border agents.  CDC Director Robert Redfield wrote in an order that illegal immigrants must be immediately deported because they \"pose a risk of further introducing or spreading COVID-19 into the United States while they are held in the congregate holding areas of [ports of entry] and Border Patrol stations at or near the border.\"  CHINESE \\'CARTELS\\' QUIETLY OPERATING IN MEXICO, AIDING US DRUG CRISIS  But the groups challenging the order argue that the Trump administration has used the pandemic as a way to enforce more stringent immigration policy.  \"Today’s ruling is a critical step in halting the Trump administration’s unprecedented and illegal attempt to expel children under the thin guise of public health,\" ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, the lead attorney in the case, said in a statement. \"The administration’s order has already allowed for the rapid expulsion of more than 13,000 children in need of protection, who were legally entitled to apply for asylum.\"  MEXICAN PIRATES POSING GREATER RISK IN GULF OF MEXICO TO OIL WORKERS, TOURISTS  Before the Trump administration\\'s March order, children who crossed the border alone were sent to government-operated shelters and could be released to family members or other sponsors while seeking asylum.  Wednesday\\'s ruling only applies to children who cross the border unaccompanied by an adult. It does not apply to nearly 200,000 people who were rapidly deported by the Trump administration during the pandemic, including individual adults and parents with kids.  Sullivan also presided over the case of President Trump’s former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  After the Justice Department dropped charges against Flynn earlier this year, Sullivan said he would not rubber stamp the department\\'s decision and would let outside groups weigh in first.  The judge was described earlier this year in The New York Times as having a \"reputation for fierce independence and low tolerance for government misconduct.\"  The Associated Press contributed to this report.', 'Deputy Secretary of the Interior Katharine MacGregor joined SiriusXM Patriot’s Breitbart News Tonight on Tuesday, where she discussed the Trump administration’s work to allow veterans and Gold Star families into national parks for free.  “We already thought our parks pass was one of the best deals on the face of the planet and what we did under Secretary [David] Bernhardt and President Trump’s leadership is basically put out an order saying they will have, all our nation’s veterans and Gold Star families, will have free lifetime passes,” MacGregor said.  “It’s all free for Interior managed land,” MacGregor added, noting that veterans will also receive free parking when they visit. She also noted that the fee removal will be valid for veterans in all “National parks, all our wildlife refugees, as well as our public land out in the West.”  MacGregor went on to note the Trump administration’s admiration for American veterans and those who continue to serve.  Our nation’s public land is precious to us and our president has signed probably the most historic conservation legislation in the lifetime under the Great American Outdoors Act to reinvest billions of dollars in taking care of these public lands and when we think about Veteran’s Day and those that serve our country, especially Gold Star families who have lost a loved one in service to our country or paid the ultimate price, those are the folks who are our first line of defense abroad, they’re serving our country and keeping us safe. … So to give them this access for a lifetime is just one small thing we can do.  “We want them to go out there and use those trails and those climbing opportunities,” MacGregor said of the veterans.  MacGregor went on to note that the Great American Outdoors Act, which was signed into law by President Trump in August, is “truly historic.”  To listen to Secretary MacGregor’s full interview, click here.', 'Latinos are a small part of Pennsylvania\\'s electorate, but they came out strong for Joe Biden and were pivotal in helping deliver the state that gave him more than the 270 Electoral College votes he needed to claim the White House.  Exit polling showed that Latinos were about 4 percent of all voters who showed up at the polls. As many as 6 in 10 Latino voters cast their ballots Biden. President Donald Trump got 35 percent of Latino votes.  In 2016, Hillary Clinton won about three-quarters of the Latino vote in Pennsylvania, and Trump got 22 percent.  A little more than half a million Latinos — about half the state\\'s Hispanic residents — are eligible to vote in Pennsylvania. Puerto Ricans are the dominant Latino group, followed by Dominican Americans and Mexicans.  \"We already knew that since the last presidential election, there were 300,000 new Latino voters in Pennsylvania, and we know that based on the results we have seen that without those folks coming and participating, maybe the result wouldn\\'t have been the same,\" said Thaís Carrero, Pennsylvania director of CASA in Action, a progressive group that does political organizing around Latino and immigrant rights advocacy, which endorsed Biden in August.  The group knocked on doors, held \"caravanas\" (car caravans), carried out phone banking and targeted misinformation that mostly was centered on voting and registration processes. Its work did not get a lot of outside investment, and it was largely grassroots, she said.  The group also provided translation and language services for voters in counties that have not had many people who are more comfortable voting in Spanish and therefore are not required to provide bilingual materials.  \"We\\'ve been building for the last four years this movement, making sure the folks know that this presidency is bad and dangerous for our communities and that they had all the tools they need to come out,\" Carrero said, \"whether by mail or in person to vote.\"  Pennsylvania\\'s Hispanic population has grown significantly, a 274 percent increase from 2010 to 2019, while its white population has declined.  Some of the growth has included Puerto Ricans who fled the island\\'s drought and financial crisis, Hurricane Maria and its aftermath, and the still-active earthquakes. The relocations have even led to some Latino presence in the state\\'s Amish country in south-central Pennsylvania.  \"I have been in Pennsylvania — I\\'m Puerto Rican — for five years, and this is my first presidential vote ever,\" Carrero said.  Because Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory and not a state, Puerto Ricans who live on the island cannot vote in presidential elections. But like Carrero, Puerto Ricans who moved to one of the 50 states are able to vote, and the Democrats and groups like CASA focused on turning them out for Biden, as did his campaign.  Carrero said her organization and its members made the \"mistreatment of Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria\" and \"abuse toward our immigrant community and the criminalization of immigration\" the focus of their outreach.  The impact of Covid-19 also was a priority, including in the organization, some of whose members or their family members died after having contracted the virus. Carrero said that helped connect the dots for voters about long-standing inequities in schools, health care coverage and employment and helped connect them with people in power.  As of Oct 28, CASA in Action has knocked on 30,006 doors in Pennsylvania and Virginia.    This morning, that number got a little higher. The lit drop team and PA Rep.

The Biden campaign focused its work in the Lehigh Valley, the area that includes Allentown, but also in the Reading and Harrisburg area, largely through virtual and digital events, the campaign said.  Biden also won the endorsement of the popular Pennsylvania Latino radio host Vic Martinez, known on the airwaves as VJ Mar. The endorsement for Biden was the first the radio program has made in its 17 years, Martinez said.  His shows broadcast on a network of stations in Reading and Allentown, where they are known as \"La Mega,\" and in Philadelphia on the station known as La Kalle — all areas with sizable Latino populations.

And late last night, we learned two of them were the president of the United States and the first lady.  In a year that’s brought so much chaos, uncertainty and disruption, the disclosure that President Trump tested positive for the coronavirus — 32 days before the election — is the biggest political development yet of 2020.  And while so much remains unclear of this morning, the news almost guarantees that the coronavirus will be the dominant story over the next month.  What happens to Trump’s campaigning and GOTV operation over at least the next two weeks? (Remember, so much of Trump’s campaign and infrastructure is dependent on his in-person rallies.)  What about Joe Biden and his team? (Biden shared the stage with Trump at last week’s debate.)  Do the remaining debates go on, including next week’s vice presidential debate? (NBC’s Amanda Golden reports that Vice President Mike Pence and his wife have tested negative as of this morning.)  What happens to Amy Coney Barrett’s Supreme Court nomination? (The New York Times says that she was at the White House earlier this week.)  What about activity on Capitol Hill? (Will the Supreme Court hearings set for later this month be delayed?)  And the country’s national security?  We already have our October surprise in this election, and it’s just the second day of the month.

Many of the Republican senators up for re-election in 2020 ran on the idea of repealing and replacing ObamaCare. But those attempts have failed, and now Democrats are hammering Republicans in states like Montana with health care as a campaign issue.  It’s amid that backdrop Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines’ new ad tries to push back on those attacks, arguing he’s tried to vote to “fix the ObamaCare mess” and that he’s “fought to protect Montanans with pre-existing conditions.”  But while Daines has said he supports keeping those protections, he also voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement in 2013. And the 2017 repeal-and-replace measure allowed for exemptions to some pre-existing conditions protections.  Daines also didn’t join some vulnerable GOP senators Thursday who broke with their party vote for a measure calling to block the administration’s anti-ObamaCare lawsuit (although he did vote Wednesday for a measure calling to keep some pre-existing condition protections if the law was axed).

Greg Abbott has ordered counties to stop accepting hand-delivered absentee ballots at more than one location, prompting accusations of voter suppression.  Amy Coney Barrett failed to disclose to the Senate her participation in a 2006 ad that called for repeal of Roe v. Wade.  Some GOP senators are breaking with the administration over their ACA lawsuit.  Conservative political operatives Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman have been charged with felonies for misleading voter robocalls.  The president is again slashing the number of new refugee admissions to the United States.', \"In recent months, we’ve been inundated with pundit analyses and campaign messaging about the enormous implications of the 2020 presidential election.  “Vote like your life depends on it.”  “This should be viewed as the most consequential election of our lifetimes.”  “Our democracy is at stake.”  Unfortunately, this time it’s not all hyperbole.  Tuesday is National Voter Registration Day, and there needs to be a push in all local communities to ensure that Americans are positioned to cast a ballot. Registration is an important first step, particularly this year.  Voter participation countrywide has been abysmal in recent elections. According to the Pew Research Center, America ranked 26th of 32 developed nations for the percentage of eligible voters who took part in the last presidential election. By Pew's count, 55.7% of the U.S. voting age population cast a vote in 2016.  America, we can and should do better.  I spent much of the weekend thinking about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died Friday at the age of 87 after a two-decade battle with cancer. She was a champion for voting rights, and she wrote a powerful dissent in 2013 when the court struck down a crucial section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by a 5-4 vote. The ruling enabled states with a history of voter discrimination to escape Justice Department oversight.  “It is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm,” Ginsburg wrote, “because you are not getting wet.”  Americans are throwing away their right to vote, even as the country drowns in political polarization. The fight over her Supreme Court seat notwithstanding, if there is one way to honor Ginsburg — a woman who stood tall for Americans' freedoms even as she experienced significant personal health crises — it is simply to vote.  After all, this Election Day will be framed in the history of a global pandemic. And there have been significant challenges to voting because of COVID-19. New voter registrations have dropped dramatically in the United States as stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements shuttered places where advocates engage with voters.  Americans missed so many opportunities for the contact-based registration drives we are used to seeing at concerts, state fairs, sporting events, art festivals and other public venues. Another avenue disappeared for months when departments of motor vehicles closed, thwarting those who would have been prompted to register to vote while registering a vehicle or renewing a driver’s license.  But not all is lost. Social media has proved to serve as a strong arm in voter engagement, particularly reaching those under 30. Last week, Snapchat reported that more than 400,000 people had used the platform to register to vote. And Foot Locker has partnered with Rock the Vote in transforming more than 2,000 retail locations into voting registration sites in an effort to encourage turnout among the more than 4 million young people eligible to cast ballots for the first time. You might chuckle at the idea, but I believe it's crucial to reach would-be voters where they are — including our filter-loving or sneaker-loving youth.  Because this is an election year like no other. For the past six months, it has been difficult to focus on little more than the novel coronavirus and the civil unrest in many American cities. But we can't afford to lose sight of the many other pressing issues and policies we must reckon with as a country: immigration, climate change, systemic racism, income inequality and health care. With each, we must ask ourselves who we believe is best suited to serve as commander in chief for the next four years.  Ultimately, you must decide which candidate best aligns with your values and political ideology. But regardless of your politics, it’s important to participate in America’s electoral process. That can only happen if you register and vote.  National columnist Suzette Hackney is a member of USA TODAY’S Editorial Board.

Three judges on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals left in place a lower court\\'s order that requires the U.S. to stop using hotels in most situations to detain children unaccompanied by a parent. The judges denied the U.S. government\\'s request for a stay of that order.  Border agents since March have placed at least 577 unaccompanied children in hotel rooms before expelling them from the country without a chance to request asylum or other immigration protections. The Trump administration argues it has to expel most people crossing the border due to public health considerations. Advocates for immigrants accuse the administration of using the coronavirus as a pretext to restrict immigration.  Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox  \"It is a sad fact that court involvement was needed once again to ensure the basic safety of children,\" said Leecia Welch, an attorney with the National Center for Youth Law.  The appeals court judges were sharply critical of the administration during oral arguments, questioning why children in the hotels weren\\'t guaranteed access to lawyers and why the government wasn\\'t using existing youth shelters that have thousands of empty beds. Those shelters offer legal services as required under a longstanding court settlement known as the Flores agreement.  A spokeswoman for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday.  Justice Department lawyer Scott Stewart argued that the Flores agreement doesn\\'t apply to children detained in hotels before expulsion.  \"Sometimes, you know, letting people have lawyers even if you\\'re not obliged to might be a good idea,\" said Judge William A. Fletcher, an appointee of President Clinton. Fletcher added it was \"an argument you may be about to lose as to whether or not the Flores agreement applies.\"  Stewart said the government\\'s policy of expelling unaccompanied children was part of a \"comprehensive, systematic approach\" to fight the coronavirus.  \"The idea is turn away as quickly as possible, at the border, potential vectors of infection,\" he said, adding that a variety of factors led to some children being detained for weeks.  U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee\\'s Sept. 4 order said hotel detention violated \"fundamental humanitarian protections\" and said the Trump administration had not demonstrated that using hotels would prevent the spread of COVID-19.  Under the Flores agreement and federal anti-trafficking law, most unaccompanied immigrant children who cross the border, with or without authorization, are supposed to be transferred to government shelters.  The Trump administration has set aside that practice during the pandemic. Instead, it has hired contractors to confine children and families to hotel rooms until they can be expelled. Lawyers who work with immigrant children have said they often don\\'t know who is being detained and where.  \"The problem is we\\'re seeing children held for far longer than a few days, in some cases up to a month, in a hotel,\" said Carlos Holguin, a lawyer for the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law who opposed the Justice Department\\'s position.  In total, the U.S. has expelled at least 147,000 people since March, including 8,800 children unaccompanied by a parent, according to government figures filed in court in September. Most are not detained in hotels. Many of those people have been directly sent back across the U.S.-Mexico border. Others, including unaccompanied children, are held for days or weeks in Border Patrol facilities unequipped for long-term detention before they are taken to deportation flights.', 'As President-elect Joe Biden claimed victory Saturday, he and his running mate made history. \"While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last,\" said Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.  The California senator is heading back to Washington as the first woman on a winning presidential ticket.  \"What a testament it is to Joe\\'s character, that he had the audacity to break one of the most substantial barriers that exists in our country and select a woman as his vice president,\" Harris said.  During her acceptance speech Saturday, she honored all the women who came before her, and who courageously fought to protect and secure the right to vote, saying, \"I stand on their shoulders.\"  Vice President-elect Kamala Harris smiles during a victory celebration in Wilmington, Delaware, on Saturday, November 7, 2020. Sarah Silbiger/Bloomberg via Getty Images  Correspondent Nikole Killion reports that people from all walks of life are saying Harris\\' election to the second-highest office in the land is a huge milestone and an inspiration to them.  She was born in Oakland as the daughter of two immigrants – an economics professor from Jamaica, and a breast-cancer researcher from India – crediting her mother for paving the way. \"When she came here from India at the age of 19, she maybe didn\\'t quite imagine this moment. But she believed so deeply in an America where a moment like this is possible,\" she said.  Harris graduated from Howard University, a highly-ranked historically Black college and university where she pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first Black Greek-letter sorority. From there she blazed a trail of firsts, as San Francisco\\'s first Black district attorney, then California\\'s first female attorney general. And in 2017, she became a U.S. senator.  Biden said, \"As a child of immigrants, she knows personally how immigrant families enrich our country, as well as the challenges of what it means to grow up Black and Indian-American in the United States of America.\"  Harris has said she often draws her words and inspiration from political powerhouse Shirley Chisholm, the first Black woman from a major political party to run for president. Announcing her candidacy in January 1972, Chisholm said, \"I am not the candidate of Black America, although I am Black and proud.\"  Only two other women have run as vice presidential nominees of a major party: Republican presidential candidate John McCain selected Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate in 2008; and in 1984 Democratic Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro made history alongside Walter Mondale.  \"America is the land where dreams can come true for all of us!\" Ferraro said at the Democratic National Convention.  Nearly 40 years later, Harris hopes to inspire a new generation.  In her speech Saturday in Wilmington, Delaware, Harris said, \"To the children of our country, regardless of your gender, our country has sent you a clear message: dream with ambition, lead with conviction, and see yourselves in a way that others may not, simply because they\\'ve never seen it before.\"  The Biden-Harris ticket is historic in other ways, too: Harris\\' husband, Douglas Emhoff, will become America\\'s first second gentlemen; and Jill Biden, a professor, will be the first first lady to work while her husband is in the Oval Office.', \"USA TODAY  Here is the full transcript of the final presidential debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, moderated by Kristen Welker in Nashville on Oct. 22, 2020. Headers have been added for ease of reading.  [0:00] Welker: A very good evening to both of you. This debate will cover six major topics. At the beginning of each section, each candidate will have two minutes, uninterrupted, to answer my first question. The debate commission will then turn on their microphone only when it is their turn to answer, and the commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired. After that, both microphones will remain on, but on behalf of the voters, I'm going to ask you to please speak one at a time. The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say. And so with that, if you're ready, let's start.  And we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus. President Trump, the first question is for you. The country is heading into a dangerous new phase. More than 40,000 Americans are in the hospital tonight with COVID, including record numbers here in Tennessee. And since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 Americans have died from COVID. So please be specific: how would you leave the country during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis? Two minutes, uninterrupted.  Trump and Biden on COVID-19  [1:03] Trump: So, as you know, more 2.2 million people, modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It's a worldwide pandemic. It’s all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country. And we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida, and it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas, it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona, it's now gone. And there were some spikes and surges in other places. They will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that's coming, it's ready. It's going to be announced within weeks, and it's going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine. I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it. And I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me — a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure. But I was in for a short period of time and I got better very fast or I wouldn't be here tonight. And now they say I'm immune. Whether it's four months or a lifetime, nobody's been able to say that, but I'm immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that's a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I've been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we've been able to do with the — if you take a look at what we've done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators. We're now making ventilators. All over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as I say, we're rounding the turn, we're rounding the corner, it's going away.  [3:05] Welker: OK, former Vice President Biden, to you, how would you lead the country out of this crisis? You have two minutes uninterrupted.  [3:12] Biden: 220,000 Americans dead. If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this. Anyone who's responsible for not taking control — in fact, not saying, I take no responsibility, initially — anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America. We're in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day, a thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day. Compared to what's going on in Europe, as the New England Medical Journal said, they're starting from a very low rate. We're starting from a very high rate. The expectation is we'll have another 200,000 Americans dead by the time, between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks — the President's own advisors told them — we could save 100,000 lives. And we're in a circumstance where the President, thus far, still has no plan. No comprehensive plan. What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask, all the time. I would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe, and give them the wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that. We're in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal — one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world — said for the first time ever that this, the way this President has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. And so folks, I will take care of this, I will end this, I will make sure we have a plan.  [5:00] Welker: President Trump, I'd like to follow up with you and your comments. You talked about taking a therapeutic. I assume you're referencing Regeneron. You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks. Is that a guarantee?  [5:12] Trump: It is not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but I think it has a good chance. One or two companies, I think, within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly.  [5:21] Welker: Can you tell us what companies?  Trump: Johnson and Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well, and we have numerous others. And then we also have others that we're working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe.  [5:34] Welker: Let me follow up with you, and because this is new information — You have said a vaccine is coming soon, within weeks now. Your own officials say it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated, and even then they say the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022. Is your timeline realistic?  [5:52] Trump: No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don't know that they're counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular, that's the head of logistics. And this is a very easy distribution for him. He's ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine, and we expect to have 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine, he's ready to go.  [6:12] Welker: Vice President Biden, your reaction? Just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government. What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved?  [6:25] Biden: Make sure it's totally transparent. Have the scientific world see, know, look at it, go through all the processes. And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by Easter last time. This the same fellow who told you that, don't worry, we're going to end this by the summer. We're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan and there's no prospect that there's going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.  [6:53] Welker: President Trump, your reaction? He says you have no plan.  [6:55] Trump: I don’t think it’s going to be a dark winter at all. We're opening up our country. We've learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn't know at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January — months later he was saying I was xenophobic, I did it too soon. Now he's saying, ‘Oh, I should have, I should have, you know, moved quicker.’ But he didn't move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me. And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal. But it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said ‘It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn't know what we were doing.’ Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this. Also everything that he said about the way — every single move that he said we should make — that's what we've done, we've done all of it, but he was way behind us.  [8:09] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response?  [8:10] Biden: My responses is, he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from China. And he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that. In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there, in China, trying to get to Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was. What did the President say in January? He said no, he said, this is — he's being transparent, the president of China is being transparent. We owe hkim a debt of gratitude. We have to thank him. And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. And again, I go back to this, he had nothing. He did virtually nothing. And then he gets out of the hospital, and he talks about we're, this is, ‘Oh, don't worry. This is all going to be over soon.’ Come on, there's not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it’s going to be over soon.  [9:02] Welker: President Trump, your reaction?  [9:03] Trump: I did not say over soon. I say we're learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I don’t know, he's obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can’t do that. By the way, I, as the president, couldn't do that. I'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can't do that. And here’s — every, every meeting I had — every meeting I had — and I meet a lot of families, including Gold Star families and military families, every meeting I had — and I had to meet them, I had to, it would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, you know, this is dangerous. And you catch it. And you know, I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot, great doctors, great hospitals. And now, I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover. We can't close up our nation, we have to open our school, and we can't close up our nation, or you're not going to have a nation.  [10:09] Welker: And of course the CDC has said young people can get sick with COVID-19 and can pass it. Vice President Biden, I want to talk broadly about strategy, though.  [10:19] Biden: Can I respond to that?  [10:20] Welker: 30 seconds please, and then I have a question.  [10:22] Biden: Number one. He says that we're, you know, we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their, out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. Learning to live with it? Come on. We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous. When's the last time? Is it really dangerous, still? Are we dangerous? Tell the people, is it dangerous now? What should they do about the danger? And you say, I take no responsibility.  [10:55] Welker: Let me talk about —  [10:56] Trump: Excuse me.  [10:57] Welker: Very quickly.  [10:58] Trump: I take full responsibility. It's not my fault that it came here. It's China's fault. You know what, it's not Joe's fault that it came here either. It's China's fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves  [11:15] Welker: Vice President Biden. as tracked is that when we knew was coming, when it hit.  [11:16] Biden: The fact is, when we knew it was coming, when it hit — What happened? What did the President say? He said don't worry, it's going to go away, it’s going to be gone by Easter. Don't worry, the warm weather. Don't worry, maybe inject bleach — he said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. A whole range of things the President said. And even today, he thinks we are in control. We're about to lose 200,000 more people  [11:42] Welker: President Trump.  [11:43] Trump: Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this. When I closed, he said, I shouldn't have closed. And that went on for months. What Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, this is a terrible thing. You’re xenophobic. I think he called me racist, even, and because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. It just Joe, it doesn't —  [12:12] Biden: I didn't say either of those things.  [12:13] Trump: You certainly did.  [12:16] Biden: I talked about his xenophobia in a different context. It wasn't about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.  [12:23] Welker: All right, I want to talk about both of your different strategies to handling this.  [12:26] Trump: He thought I shouldn't have closed the border. That’s obvious.  [12:30] Welker: Do you wanna respond to that quickly, vice president?  [12:33] Biden: No.  [12:33] Welker: OK, let's talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this. Mr. Vice President, you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it. What do you say to Americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger depression, domestic and substance abuse, outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus?  [12:51] Biden: What I would say is I'm going to shut down the virus, not the country. It’s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part — why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living and why they're concerned. Those other concerns are real. That's why he should have been — instead of in a sand trap at his golf course — he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity.  [13:21] Welker: You haven't ruled out more shutdowns  [13:24] Biden: Oh no, I'm not shutting down the nation but there are, look, they need standards. The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that's above a certain level, everybody says, slow up. More social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control, under more control. But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. For example schools — schools, they need a lot of money to open. They need to deal with ventilation systems, they need to deal with smaller classes, more teacher, more pods, and he's refused to support that money, or at least up to now  [14:03] Welker: Let's talk about schools. President Trump —  [14:05] Trump: Well, I think we have to respond, if I might.  [14:07] Welker: Please, and then I have a follow up.  [14:08] Trump: Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shutdowns but forget about him. His democrat governors — Cuomo in New York, you look at what's going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all — they are shut down so tight, and they're dying. They're dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shutdowns No, we're not going to shut down, and we have to open our schools. And it's like, as an example, I have a young son. He also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor, the second time, he was fine, it just went away. Young people, I guess it’s their immune system.  [14:46] Welker: Let me follow up, President Trump. You've demanded schools open in person and insisted they can do it safely. But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike. What is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids, but also their teachers and families?  [15:04] Trump: I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small, but I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We're not going to have a country. You can't do this, we can't keep this country closed. It is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs, they're committing suicide. There's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. There's abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. You know I've said it often — the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that's what's happening, and he wants to close down. He'll close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down.  [15:49] Welker: Vice President Biden, your —  [15:51] Biden: Simply not true. We're gonna be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be able to safely open, but we need resources to open. You need to be able to, for example, if you're gonna open a business, have social distancing within the business. You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether a person is, in fact, infected. You need to be able to trace. You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that we're going to make sure that we open safely. And by the way, all you teachers out there — not that many of you are going to die, so don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Come on.  [16:37] Welker: President Trump, let me follow up with you quickly.  [16:39] Trump: I will say this, if you go and look at what's happened to New York, ut's a ghost town. It's a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglas — these are restaurants that are dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting the plexiglas is unbelievably expensive, and it's not the answer. I mean, you're going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic? These are businesses that are dying, Joe, you can't do that to people, which again, take a look at New York and what's happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it. It was vibrant. It's dying. Everyone's leaving New York.  [17:34] Welker: Vice President.  [17:34] Biden: Take a look what New York has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying. And I don't look at this in terms of what he does, blue states and red states. They’re all the United States. And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They’re the red states. They are the states in the Midwest, they are the states in the upper Midwest, that's where the spike is occurring significantly, but they're all Americans. They're all Americans and what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one, make sure we get the help that the businesses need. The money's already been passed to do that. It's been out there since the beginning of this summer and nothing's happened.  Trump: New York has lost more than 40,000 people. 11,000 people in nursing.  [18:00] Welker: President Trump, what about —  [18:02] Trump: When you say spike, take a look at what's happening in Pennsylvania, where they've had it closed. Take a look at what's happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband's the only one allowed to do anything. It's been like a prison. Now it was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina. They're having spikes and they've been closed, and they're getting killed financially. We can't let that happen, Joe, you can't let that happen. We have to open up and we understand that disease, we have to protect our seniors, we have to protect our elderly, we have to protect, especially, our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect them. We have the best testing in the world by far. That's why we have so many cases.  [18:42] Welker: Let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section. President Trump, this week you called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's best known infectious disease expert, “a disaster.” You described him and other medical experts as “idiots.” If you're not listening to them, who are you listening to?  [18:58] Trump: I'm listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony. But he did say, ‘don't wear masks.’ He did say, as you know, ‘this is not going to be a problem.’ I think he's a Democrat, but that's okay. He said, ‘this is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.’ When Joe says that, I said — Anthony Fauci said and others and many others. And I'm not knocking him. Nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was, nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. We've learned a lot, but Anthony said, ‘don't wear masks.’ Now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here’s his exact words: ‘This is no problem, this is going to go away soon.’ So he's allowed to make mistakes, he happens to be a good person.  [19:43] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response, quickly and then we're going to move on to the next section.  [19:45] Biden: My response is think about what the President knew in January and didn't tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse than — much worse — than the flu. He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn't want to tell us, didn't want to tell us because he didn't want us to panic. He didn't want us — Americans don't panic. He panicked. Well, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, ‘this is a really dangerous thing,’ and a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — had said, ‘sell short, because we gotta get moving. It's a dangerous problem.’  [20:30] Trump: Well this is —  [20:31] Welker: I’m going to give you 30 seconds to respond and then we're gonna move on.  [20:33] Trump: I don't know if somebody went to Wall Street. You're the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don't take it. You have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money. And every time you raise money, deals are made. I could raise so much more money. As president and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America, I would blow away every record. But I don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn't be bringing up Wall Street. Because you're the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldn't believe. We don't need money. We have plenty of money. In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get. Don’t tell me about wall street.  [21:15] Welker: All right, gentlemen, we're gonna move on.  [21:17] Biden: Average contribution, $43.  On national security  [21:18] Welker: All right, we're gonna move on to our next section which is national security. And I do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight. Just last night, top intelligence officials confirmed again that both Russia and Iran are working to influence this election. Both countries have obtained U.S. voter registration information, these officials say, and Iran sent intimidating messages to Florida voters. This question goes to you, Mr. Vice President, what would you do to put an end to this threat? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.  [21:48] Biden: I made it clear. And I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price. They will pay the price. It has been overwhelmingly clear in this election — I won't even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved. China has been involved to some degree, and now we learned that, that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if I'm elected. Interfering with American sovereignty. That's what's going on right now. They're interfering with American sovereignty. And to the best of my knowledge, I don't think the President said anything to Putin about it. I don't think he's talking a lot. I don't think he said a word. I don't know why he hasn't said a word to Putin about it. And I don't know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians. My guess is he’d probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians. But the point is this, folks. We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy — well, I won't, I shouldn't — I will — his buddy Rudy Giuliani. He's being used as a Russian pawn. He's being fed information that is Russian, that is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens. And then you find out that everything is going on here about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States because they know I know them, and they know me. I don't understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he's engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO. I don't know why he doesn't do it but it's worth asking the question. Why isn't that being done? Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price because they're affecting our sovereignty.  [23:45] Welker: President Trump, same question to you. Let me, let me ask the question. You're gonna have two minutes to respond for two elections in a row now there has been substantial interference from foreign adversaries. What would you do in your next term to put an end to this? Two minutes, uninterrupted.  [23:56] Trump: Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered. Joe got three and a half million dollars from Russia. And it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow’s wife. He got three and a half million dollars. Your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, you're gonna have to explain — why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia. I don't get money from Russia. Now, about your thing last night, I knew all about that, and through John — who is John Radcliffe, who is a fantastic DNI — he said, the one thing that's common to both of them, they both want you to lose. Because there has been nobody tougher to Russia. Between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia. Between the sanctions between all of what I've done with NATO. You know, I've got the NATO countries to put up an extra 130 billion, going to $420 billion a year, that's to guard against Russia. I sold — while he was selling pillows and sheets — I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. And I'll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the, the submarine port. You remember that very well during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it's even worse. All of the emails, the emails are horrible. The emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening. And it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago, who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now.  [26:01] Welker: Vice President Biden, you may respond to follow up on the election security.  [26:06] Biden: I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. We learn that this President paid 50 times the tax in China, as a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money? I have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever, ever, number one. Number two, this is a president — I have released all of my tax returns. 22 years. Go look at them. 22 years of my tax return. You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding? Why are you unwilling? The foreign countries are paying you a lot. Russia is paying you a lot. China is paying a lot. And your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world. And China's building a new road to a new gas… a golf course you have overseas. So what's going on here? Why don't you release your tax return or stop talking about corruption?  [27:04]Welker: President Trump, your response.  [27:06] Trump: First of all, I called my accounts — under audit. I'm going to release them as soon as we can. I want to do it, and it will show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. I asked them a week ago, I said, what did I pay? They said, sir, you pre-paid tens of millions of dollars. I prepaid my tax. Tens. Over the last number of years. Tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think, it's an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So, I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that.  [27:42] Welker: Did your accountant tell you —  [27:44] Trump: Excuse me. And it wasn't written whenever they write this. They keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee. But let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one. Number two, I don't make money from China, you do. I don't make money from Ukraine, you do. I don't make money from Russia. You made three and a half million dollars, Joe, and your son gave you. They even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. You're the big man, I think. I don't know, maybe you're not. But you're the big man, I think. You son said that we have to give 10% to the big man. Joe, what's that all about? It's terrible.  [28:22] Welker: All right, gentlemen, I want to ask you both some questions about all of this. I'm gonna let you both respond, very quickly. You just said you spoke to your accountant about potentially releasing your taxes. Did he tell you when you can release them? Do you have a deadline for when you're going to release them to the American people?  [28:35] Trump: I get treated worse than the Tea Party got treated. A lot of people in there, deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly. We made a deal, it was all settled, until I decided to run for president. I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done. As soon as we're completed with the deal, I want to release it. But I have paid millions and millions of dollars. And it's worse than paying. I paid in advance. It's called prepaying your taxes. I paid.  [29:04] Welker: I want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly.  [29:12] Biden: At some point I want to respond.  [29:13] Welker: Respond very quickly, and then I'll get to my question.  [29:15] Biden: Why do he — He's been saying this for four years. Show us. Just show us. Stop playing around. You’ve been saying for four years you’re going to release your taxes. Nobody knows, Mr. President, they do know is you're not paying your taxes or you're paying taxes that are so low. When last time he said what he paid, he said, ‘I only pay that little because I'm smart. I know how to game the system.’ Come on, come on, folks.  [29:42] Welker: Quickly, President Trump, and then I want to get to two questions to both of you.  [29:46] Trump: I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied on my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this. Mueller and 18 angry Democrats, and FBI agents all over the place spent, $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. I guarantee you, if I spent 1 million on you Joe, I could find plenty wrong, because the kind of things that you've done and the kind of monies that your family has taken — I mean, your brother made money in Iraq, millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and it's all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well. You have houses all over the place. You live very well.  [30:41] Welker: All right, gentlemen, let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly. Vice President Biden, there have been questions about the work your son has done in China, and for Ukrainian energy company when you were Vice President. In retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical?  [30:56] Biden: Nothing was unethical. Here's what the deal. With regard to Ukraine, we had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned, of Burisma, a company, that somehow I had done something wrong. Yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath who worked for him, said I did my job impeccably. I carried out US policy. Not one, single, solitary thing was out of line. Not a single thing, number one. Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy, trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do, and did not do, because it never, ever, ever happened. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about — what are you talking about — China. I have not had it. The only guy that made money from China is this guy. He’s the only one. Nobody else has made money from China.  [31:58] Welker: Let me ask my question to you.  [32:00] Trump: Could I just — one thing.  [32:01] Welker: Very quickly.  [32:02] Trump: His son didn't have a job for a long time, was sadly no longer in the military service, I won't get into that. And he didn't have a job. As soon as he became vice president, Burisma — not the best, not the best reputation in the world — I hear they paid him 183,000 a month. Listen to this, 183, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. That’s 100% dishonest.  [32:27] Welker: I’m going to let the vice president respond to that quickly and then I have a question for you.  [32:31] Biden: No basis for that. Everybody investigated that, no one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine.  [32:35] Welker: OK, President Trump, this is for you. Since you took office, you've never divested from your business. You've personally promoted your properties abroad. A report this week, which was referenced, does indicate that your company has a bank account in China. So how can voters know that you don't have any foreign conflicts of interest?  [32:52] Trump: I have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business. The bank account you're referring to — which is, everybody knows about it, it's listed — the bank account was in 2013. That's what it was. It was opened. It was closed in 2015, I believe, and then I decided, because I was going to do, I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it. And I decided I'm not going to do it, didn't like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it.  [32:26] Welker: OK.  [32:27] Trump: Excuse me, and then unlike him, where he's Vice President, and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that. That was before. So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference. He is the Vice President of the United States, and his son, his brother and his other brother are getting rich, they're like a vacuum cleaner, there's something —  [33:54] Welker: We do need to move on. I do want to ask you, Vice President Biden, about China. Let's talk about China more broadly. There have, of course, President Trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus. If you were president, would you make China pay and please be specific, what would that look like?  Biden: What I’d make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done. He has caused the deficit in China to go up not down — with China, go up not down. We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property. You have to get/have a partner in China, it is 51%. We would not do that at all, number one. Number two, we're in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well. When I met with Xi, and when I was still vice president, he said ‘we're setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea, you can't fly through them.’ I said, ‘we're gonna fly through them. We just flew B52/B1 bombers through it. We're not going to pay attention.’ They have to play by the rules, and what's he do? He embraces guys like the thugs like in North Korea, and, and, and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger in the eye of all our friends, all of our allies. We make up only — we’ re 25%. 25% of the world's economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us, saying to China, these are the rules. You play by them or you're going to pay the price for not paying by them, economically. That's the way I will run it. And that's what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice president.  [35:33] Welker: All right, let's talk about North Korea.  [35:35] Trump: Excuse me, no, I have to respond to this.  [35:37] Welker: OK, very quickly and then we're gonna have...  [35:39] Trump: His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China —  [35:41] Biden: Not true.  [35:42] Trump: — after spending 10 minutes in office and being an Air Force Two, number one. Number two, there's a very strong email, talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions.  [35:56] Biden: That is not true.  [35:56] Welker: President Trump, on China policy, though. What are you gonna do? What specifically are you going to do to make China pay?  [36:03] Trump: First of all, China is paying. They’re paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion.  [36:07] Welker: Through sanctions?  [36:08] Trump: I just gave $28 billion to our farmers.  [36:12] Biden: Taxpayers money.  [36:14] Trump: It’s what?  [36:15] Biden: Taxpayers money.  [36:16] Trump: No, the taxpayers. It's called China.  [36:20] Biden: Not true.  [36:20] Trump: China pays for $28 billion and you know what they did to pay it, Joe? They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know who got the money? Our farmers. Our great farmers, because they would target it. You never charge them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry. We were not going to have a steel, and now we have a steel industry  [36:42] Welker: OK, Vice President Biden, your response, please?  [36:49] Biden: This isn't about me. There's a reason why he's bringing up all this malarkey. There's a reason for it. He doesn't want to talk about the substantive issues. It's not about his family and my family. It's about your family, and your family's hurting badly. If you're making less than, if you're a middle class family, you're getting hurt badly right now. You're sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, well, we can't get new tires, they’re bald, because we have to wait another month. Or, so are we going to be able to pay the mortgage? Who's going to tell her, she can't go back to community college? They're the decisions you're making in the middle class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymot. They're in trouble. We should be talking about your families but that's the last thing he wants to talk about.  [37:26] Welker: I wanted to say, I want to tell —  [37:28] Trump: That is a typical statement. Just 10 seconds, please.  [37:29] Welker: 10 seconds Mr President, 10 seconds.  [37:31] Trump: Just a typical political statement. Let's get off this China thing, and then he looks — the family, around the table, everything. Just a typical politician when I see that.  [37:40] Welker: All right, let’s talk —  [37:40] Trump: I’m not a typical politician, that’s why I got elected.  [37:44] Welker: Let’s talk about —  [37:44] Trump: Let’s get off the subject of China, let's talk around sitting around the table. Come on, Joe, you can do better.  [37:48] Welker: We're gonna talk about North Korea now. President Trump, you've met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's three times. You've talked about your beautiful letters with him, you've touted the fact that there hasn't been a war or a long range missile test, and yet North Korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal. Do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship? Just 30 seconds here because we need to get on to the next topic.  [38:12] Trump: When I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said the biggest problem we have is North Korea. He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what, it would be a nuclear war, and he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of relationship. We have a very good relationship, and there's no war. And you know, about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, ‘oh there's going to be trouble.’ I said, ‘No, they're not. Because he's not going to do that.’ And I was right. :ook, instead of being in a war where millions of people — Seoul, you know, is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people in Seoul — millions of people would be dead right now. We don’t have a war, and I have a good relationship.  [39:05] Welker: Vice President Biden, North Korea conducted four nuclear tests under the Obama administration. Why do you think you would be able to rein in this persistent threat?  [39:15] Biden: Because I'd make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because here's the root. I made it clear, as a spokesperson for the administration when I went to China, they said, ‘Why are you moving your missile defense up so close? Why are you moving more forces? Why are you continuing to do military maneuvers with South Korea?’ I said, ‘Because North Korea is a problem. And we're going to continue to do it so we can control them. We're going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up. And help if not, it's going to continue.’ What has he done? He's legitimized North Korea, he's talked about his good buddy who's a thug, a thug, and he talks about how we're better off, and they have much more capable missiles, able to reach U.S. territory, much more easily than ever did before.  [40:05] Welker: Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden, you've said you wouldn't meet with Kim Jong Un without preconditions. Are there any conditions under which you would meet with him?  [40:12] Biden: On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get there. The Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone.  [40:21] Welker: All right, let's move on to American families.  [40:24] Trump: Kristen, they tried to meet with him.  [40:24] Welker: Very quickly. 10 seconds, President Trump.  Trump: They tried to meet with him, he wouldn’t do it. He didn’t like Obama. He didn’t like him. He wouldn’t do it.  [40:32] Welker: OK, I’ve got to give him a chance to respond.  [40:33] Trump: They tried, he wouldn’t do it. And that’s okay. You know what, North Korea, we’re not in a war. We have a good relationship. You know, people don’t understand — having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing.  [40:43] Welker: President Trump, we have to move on. We have a lot of questions to get through.  [40:43] Biden: We had a good relationship with Hitler before he in fact invaded Europe, the rest of Europe. Come on. The reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said we’re gonna talk about denuclearization, we’re not gonna legitimize you, we’re gonna continue to put stronger and stronger sanctions on you. That’s why he wouldn’t meet with us.  [41:10] Trump: And it didn’t happen.  [41:12] Welker: Let’s move on and talk about American families.  [41:14] Trump: Excuse me, he left me a mess, Kristen. They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess.  [41:18] Welker: We need to move on so that we have time to get to all our questions tonight, President Trump.  [41:22] Trump: Remember the first two or three months. There was a very dangerous period in my first three months, before we sort of worked things out a little bit. They left us a mess, and Obama would be – I think, the first to say — it was the single biggest problem, he thought, that our country had.  On the economy  [41:47] Welker: All right, let's move on to American families and the economy. One of the issues that's most important to them is health care, as you both know. Today, there was a key vote on a new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and healthcare is at the center of her confirmation fight. Over 20 million Americans get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It's headed to the Supreme Court, and your administration, Mr. President, is advocating for the court to overturn it. If the supreme court does overturn that law, those 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight. So what would you do if those people have their health insurance taken away? You have two minutes uninterrupted.  Trump: First of all, I've already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate -- we have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. I terminate it; it's gone. Now it's in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, ‘Run it as well as you can’ -- to my people, great people -- ‘Run it as well as you can.’ I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down, everything's down. Here's the problem. No matter how well you run it, it's no good. What we'd like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don't know that it's going to work. If we don't win, we will have to run it and we'll have Obamacare, but it will be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare. Because without the individual mandate, it is much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better. We’ll always protect people with pre existing -- so I'd like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care. The Democrats will do it because there'll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House at that time. And I think we're going to win the House, okay? You'll see, but I think we're gonna win the House. But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre existing conditions -- and one thing very important. We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than we're talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love the health care, people that have been successful -- middle income people -- been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine. He won't even have a choice. They want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job with health care. And we're going to do even better.  45:12 Welker: OK. Vice President Biden, yes, this is for you. Your health care plan calls for building on Obamacare. So my question is, what is your plan if the law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court? You have two minutes uninterrupted.  Biden: What I'm going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option -- become Bidencare. Public option is an option that says that if you, in fact, do not have the wherewithal to be -- if you qualify for Medicaid, and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. That's what's going to happen. Secondly, we're going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there's competition that doesn't exist now by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance -- the reason why I had such a fight for, with 20 candidates for the nomination, was I support private insurance. That's why I did not -- not one single person, private insurance, would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance, unless they chose they wanted to go to something else. Lastly, we're going to make sure we're in a situation that we've actually protect pre existing -- there's no way he can protect pre existing conditions. None, zero, you can't do it in the ether. He's been talking about this for a long time. There is no -- he's never come up with a plan. I guess we're gonna get the pre existing condition plan the same time we get the infrastructure plan that we waited since 17, 18, 19, 20. The fact that -- I still have a little, a few more minutes, I know you're getting anxious -- the fact is that he’s already cost the American people because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have been under Obamacare, and over 110 million people with pre existing conditions. And all the people from COVID are going to have pre existing conditions. What are they going to do?  47:20 Welker: I have a follow up for you, Vice President Biden, it relates to something that President Trump said. He's accusing you of wanting socialized medicine. What do you say to people who have concerns that your health care plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes the country one step closer to a health care system run entirely by the government?  Biden: What he’s saying, it's ridiculous. It’s like saying that, you know, we're the idea that, the fact that there's a public option that people can choose, that makes the socialist plan? Look, the difference between the president -- I think health care is not a privilege, it's a right. Everyone should have the right to have affordable health care. And I am very proud of my plan. It's gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as, as well as a whole range of other people who in fact, are concerned in the medical field. This is something that's going to save people's lives. And this is going to give some people an opportunity, an opportunity to have health care for their children, how many of you home are worried and rolling around in bed at night wondering what in God's name are you going to do if you get sick? Because you've lost your home insurance, your health insurance, your company's gone under. We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that's what I do.  Welker: President Trump, your response.  Trump: Excuse me, he was there for 47 years -- he didn't do it. He was now there as Vice President for eight years. And it's not like it was 25 years ago, it was three and three quarters. It was just a little while ago, right? Less than four years ago. He didn't do anything. He didn't do it. He wants socialized medicine. And it's not that he wants it, his vice president -- I mean, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more, Bernie Sanders wants it, the Democrats want it. You're going to have socialized medicine. Just like you went on with fracking -- ‘We're not going to have fracking, we're going to stop fracking, we're going to stop fracking.’ Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets the nomination -- well he got very lucky to get it. And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, ‘Oh, we're gonna have fracking.’ And you never asked a question. And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you're handling this, I have to say. But by the way, somebody should ask the question. He goes for a year --  49:24 Welker: We do have a number of -- we have a number of topics.  Trump: No, no, but that's a question --  Welker: We're gonna get to it --  Trump: It’s the same thing with socialized medicine.  Welker: Vice President, your response.  Biden: My response is people deserve to have affordable health care -- period. Period, period, period. And the Bidencare proposal will, in fact, provide for that affordable health care, lower premiums. What we're going to do is going to cost some money; it's going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it. And they're going to have lower premiums, you can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly. He keeps talking about it. He hasn't done a thing for anybody on health care, not a thing.  Trump: Kristen, when he says --  Welker: Very quickly, then I want to talk about what’s happening on Capitol Hill  50:08 Trump: When he says public health option, he is talking about socialized medicine and health care. When he talks about a public option, he's talking about destroying your Medicare, totally destroying -- he’s destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. You know, Bernie Sanders tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor, they wanted to make it work --  Welker: Let's see if --  50:31 Trump: -- it was impossible --  Welker: Vice President Biden, your response.  50:34 Biden: He thinks he's running against someone else. He's running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden, he's running against. And the idea that we're in a situation and want to destroy Medicare -- this is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, ‘If in fact’ -- and, social security -- ‘If, in fact, he continues to withhold his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023, with no way to pay for it. This is a guy who's tried to cut Medicare. So I don't know. I mean, the idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare? Come on.  Trump: He tried to get rid of --  Welker: Vice Presiden, Mr. President, I’m going to have to go on to another question --  Trump: -- he tried to hurt Social Security years ago, years ago. Go back and look at the records. He tried to hurt Social Security you've got --  51:28 Welker: All right, let’s move on to the next question.  51:31 Trump: They say the stock market will rule if I'm elected. If he's elected, the stock market will crash.  Welker: OK, let's move on to the next question.  Biden: May I respond?  Welker: Very quickly.  51:40 Biden: The idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening. Where I come from, in Scranton and Claymont, the people don't live off of the stock market. Just in the last three, three years during this crisis, the billionaires in this country made, according to the Wall Street, $700 billion more dollars. $700 billion more dollars. Because that's his only measure. What happens to the ordinary people out there? What happens to them?  52:11 Trump: 401k’s are through the roof. 401k --  Welker: All right, let’s move on.  52:14 Trump: -- are through the roof. And he doesn't come from Scranton. That's like, what -- he lived there for a short period of time before he even knew --  Welker: We're gonna move on --  Trump: And he left. And the people of Pennsylvania will tell you that.  Welker: -- to my next question, gentlemen. As of tonight, more than 12 million people are out of work. And as of tonight, 8 million more homes have fallen into poverty, and more families are going hungry every day. Those hit hardest are women and people of color. They see Washington fighting over a relief bill. Mr. President, why haven't you been able to get them the help they need? 30 seconds here.  Trump: Because Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve it. I do.  Welker: But you're the president.  Trump: I do. But I still have to get, unfortunate -- that's one of the reasons I think we're going to take over the House, because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve anything. She'd love to have some victories on a date called November 3. Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing and able to do something. Don't forget, we've already approved three plans. And it's gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness. This one she doesn't want. It's near the election, because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically.  Welker: All right, Mr. Vice President --  Biden: You know, the Republican leader in the United States Senate said he can't -- he will not pass it. He does not have Republican votes. Why isn’t he talking to his Republican friends?  Welker: Let me follow up with you, Vice President  Trump: If we made a deal, we’d have --  53:32 Welker: Let me ask Vice President Biden the question. You are the leader of the Democratic Party. Why have you not [] Democrats to get a deal for the American people?  Biden: Well, I have and they have pushed it. Look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer. This is like -- it's not new. It's been out there. The HEROES Act has been sitting there. And look at what's happening. When I was in charge of the Recovery Act with $800 billion, I was able to get $145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budget to states that have to balance their budgets, so then they have to fire fire -- they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they can keep their cities and counties running. He will not support that. They have not done a thing for them. And Mitch McConnell said, ‘Let him go bankrupt. Let him go bankrupt.’ Come on. What's the matter with these --  Trump: The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrats, cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars to these cities. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people's pockets to people that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them. And what that does, and I'd love to do that, I'd love to help them. But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can't do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of sending them things that had nothing to do with COVID, as for your question, but it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states.  Welker: I want --  Biden: All right, if I get elected, I'm not gonna -- I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm gonna be an American president. I don't see red states and blue states. What I see is American United States. And folks, every single state out there finds themselves in trouble. They're going to start laying off, whether they're red or blue. Cops, firefighters, first responders, teachers -- because they have to balance their budget. And the founders were smart. They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America.  Welker: I want to talk about the minimum wage, gentlemen. Mr. Vice President, we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses and business owners today. Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage? You, of course, support a $15 minimum wage.  Biden: I do, because I think one of the things we’re gonna have to do is we're gonna have to bail them out, too. We should be bailing them out now, those small businesses. You’ve got one in six of them going under. They're not going to be able to make it back. They passed a package that allows us to be able to call PPP, money that’s supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they could deal with their businesses being open safely. Schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in. They need the help, the businesses, as well as the schools, need the help. But this, these guys will not help them. He is not giving them any of the money.  Welker: We are going to move on --  56:35 Trump: For small businesses -- by raising the minimum wage and helping, I think it should be a state option. Alabama is different than New York, New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option. So it's very important. We have to help our small business --  Welker: You said --  Trump: How are you helping small businesses, when you're forcing wages. What's going to happen and what's been proven to happen is when you do that these firemen  57:03 Welker: Well you said you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 a hour --  Trump: Say again?  Welker: You said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Is that still the case?  57:10 Trump: What I’d really like, I would consider it to an extent. I really like what I -- in a second administration -- but not to a level that's going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option. Look, I have a read on different places, I know different places. They’re all different. Some places, $15 is not so bad. In other places, other states, $15 --  Welker: OK, President Trump, thank you. Quick response, Vice President Biden  Biden: Two jobs, one job below poverty. People are making 6, 7, 8 bucks an hour. These first responders we all clap for as they come down the street, because they've allowed us to make it. What's happening? They deserve a minimum wage of $15. Anything below that put you below the poverty level. And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, business has gone out of business. That is simply not true.  On immigration  Welker: We're going to talk about immigration. We're going to talk about immigration, now, gentlemen, and we're going to talk about families within this context. Mr. President, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4000 kids, You've since reversed your zero tolerance policy, but the United States can't locate the parents of more than 500 children. So how will these families ever be reunited?  Trump: Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels, and they're brought here and it’s easy to use them to get into our country. We now have a stronger border as we've ever had. We’re over 400 miles of brand new wall, you see the numbers, and we let people in, but they have to come in legally.  Welker: But how will you reunite these kids with their families?  58:48 Trump: Let me just say. They built cages. You know, they used to say I built the cages. And then they had a picture in the newspaper. There was a picture of these horrible cages and they said, ‘Look at these cages, President Trump built them.’ And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him.  Welker: Do you have a plan to reunite the kids?  59:08 Trump: Yes, we're working on a very -- we're trying very hard. But a lot of these kids come up without the parents, they come over through cartels and the coyotes and through gangs.  Welker: Vice President Biden, let me bring you into this conversation. Quick response and then another question to you.  Biden: These 500 plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. Big real tough, really strong. And guess what? They cannot -- it’s not coyotes that bring them over, their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents. And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every judge of who we are as a nation.  Welker: Let me ask you a follow up --  Trump: Kristen, they did it, we changed the policy. They did it. We changed it. They set up the cages. They -- who built the cages?  Biden: So let's talk about --  Trump: Who built the cages, Joe?  59:58 Biden: Let’s talk about what we’re talking about. What happened? Parents were ripped -- their kids were ripped from their arms and separated. And now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go, nowhere to go. It's criminal. It's criminal.  Welker: Let me just --  Trump: Let me say this. They worked it out, we brought reporters and everything. They are so well taken care of. They're in facilities that were so clean --  Welker: But some of them haven’t been reunited --  Trump: But just answer one question. Who built the cages? A big ask of that, who built the cages?  Welker: Let me ask about your immigration policy, Mr. Vice President. The Obama administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration. It also presided over record deportations as well as family detentions at the border before changing course. So why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now?  Biden: Because we made a mistake. It took too long to get it right. Too long to get it right. I'll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States. And the fact is, and I’ve made it very clear, within 100 days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people. And all those so called Dreamers, those DACA kids, they're going to be legally certified again, to be able to stay in this country, and put on a path to citizenship. The idea that they are being sent home by this guy, and they want to do, that is they go to a country they've never seen before. I can imagine you're five years old, your parents are taking you across the Rio Grande River and it’s and it's illegal. You say ‘Oh, no, Mom, leave me here. I'm not gonna go with you.’ They’ve been here. Many of them are model citizens. 20,000 are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them. We owe them.  1:01:51 Welker: President Trump, your response.  Trump: He had eight years to do what he said he was going to do. And I've changed without having a specific -- we get rid of catch and release, got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they live with. But he had eight years he was vice president. He did nothing except build cages to keep children in.  Welker: Vice President, what’s your response?  Biden: The catch and release, you know what he's talking about there? If in fact, you had family, came across, they're arrested. They, in fact, were given a date to show up for their hearing. They were released. And guess what, they showed up for the hearing. This is the first President in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country. That's never happened before. That’s never happened before in our country. You come to the United States and you make your case. That’s how you seek asylum, based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law. They're sitting in squalor on the other side of the river.  1:02:55 Welker: President Trump, there is --  Trump: It’s so important. It shows that he has no understanding of immigration of the laws. Catch and release is a disaster. A murderer would come in, a rapist would come in, a very bad person would come in -- we would take their name, we have to release them into our country. And then you say they come back. Less than 1% of the people come back.  Biden: Not true.  Trump: We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them. We would say, ‘Come back in two years, three years -- we're going to give you a court case. You did Perry Mason, we're going to give you a court case. When you say they come back, they don't come back, Joe. They never come back. Only the really -- I hate to say this -- but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back.  Welker: OK, President Trump, let’s give Vice President Biden a chance to respond, and then we're going to move on to the next section.  Trump: You don’t know the law, Joe.  Welker: Vice President Biden, your response.  Biden: I know the law. What he's telling you is simply not true.  Trump: They don’t come back.  Biden: Check it out.  Welker: All right, let's move on --  Trump: But we don’t have to worry about it because I terminated it. So we don’t have to worry about it  1:03:59 Welker: All right, let’s move on to the next section --  1:04:04 Biden: You have 525 kids not knowing where in God’s name they’re going to be and lost their parents.  Trump: Go ahead.  On race in America  Welker: All right. Let's talk about our next section, which is race in America. And I want to talk about the way Black and Brown Americans experience race in this country. Part of that experience is something called “the talk.” It happens regardless of class and income -- parents who feel they have no choice but to prepare their children for the chance that they could be targeted, including by the police, for no reason other than the color of their skin. Mr. Vice President, in the next two minutes, I want you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?  Biden: I do. I do. You know, my daughter is a social worker. And she's written a lot about this. She's got a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work. So, one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90 percent African American, was to learn more about what was going on. When I didn't -- I never had to tell my daughter if she's pulled over, make sure she puts, for traffic stop, puts both hands on top of the wheel. And don't reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you. But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you're walking down the street, don't have a hoodie on when you go across the street, making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, just Yes or No sir, just hands on top of the wheel. Because you are in fact, the victim, whether you're a person making 300,000 -- $300,000-a-year person, or someone who's on food stamps. The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America. And we have always said we've never lived up to it. Do we hold these truths to be sovereign, are all men and women are created equal? Guess what -- we have never ever lived up to it. We have constantly been moving the needle further and further between inclusion and exclusion. This is the first president come along and says that's the end of that. We're not going to do that anymore. We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better health care, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses. All the things we can do. And I've laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things. Just to give people a shot. It's about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence.  1:06:32 Welker: President Trump, same question to you. And let me remind you of the question, I would like you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?  Trump: Yes, I do. And again, he's been in government 47 years. He never did a thing except in 1994, when he did such harm to the Black community. And they were called, and he called them, super predators. And he said that, he said it -- super predators. And they can never live that down. 1994, your crime bill, the super predators. Nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln--possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I've done. Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn't do it. I don't even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might have wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms I had a twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. And everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my office--they cried in the Oval Office. Two weeks later, they're out saying, ‘Gee, we have to defeat him.’ Criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, a great senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones. It’s one of the most successful programs. People don't talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made. Biggest beneficiary, the Black and Hispanic communities and then historically Black colleges and universities. After three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great, they came into the office. And they said-- I said, ‘What are you doing after three years?’ I said, ‘Why do you keep coming back?’ ‘Because we have no funding’. I said, ‘You don't have to come back every year’, ‘We have to come back’, because President Obama would never give them long term funding. And I did. Ten-year, long term funding, and I give them more money than they asked for, because I said, ‘I think you need more’. And I said, ‘The only bad part about this is I may never see you again’, because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them. But I saved colleges and universities.  [1:08:28] Welker: OK. And we're going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that Vice President?  [1:08:33] Biden: My response to that is I never, ever said what he accused me of saying. The fact of the matter is, in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said, ‘The problem with the crime bill, there's not enough people in jail. There's not enough people in jail,’ and go on my website, get the quote the date when he said it, ‘not enough people’. He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, the people who are going to mauraud our cities. This is a guy who when the Central Park five, five innocent Black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty. None of them were-- none of them were guilty of what the crime, of the crimes that were suggested. Look, and talk about he, granted, he did in fact let 20 people-- he committed 20 people’s sentences. We committed over 1,000 people’s sentences. Over 1,000. The very law he's talking about is a law that, in fact, initiated by Barack Obama. And secondly, we're in a situation here where we-- the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration. And one of the things we should be doing is there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law. That's why I'm offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. Nobody should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and that's what I'm going to do.  [1:10:04] Trump: But why didn't he do it four years ago? Why didn't you do that four years ago, even less than that? Why didn't you--  [1:10:10] Biden: I am not--  [1:10:10] Trump: You were vice president. You keep talking about all these things you're going to do and you're going to do this. But you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing.  [1:10:19] Biden: We did--  [1:10:20] Trump: You know, Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I said you did a good job, I would have never run. I would've never run. I ran because of you. I'm looking at you now, you're a politician. I ran because of you.  [1:10:34] Welker: All right, Vice President Biden, your response to that? And then I do have some questions for both of you.  [1:10:38] Biden: Well, I’ll tell you what, I hope he does look at me because what's happening here is you know who I am, you know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth. I am anxious to have this race. I'm anxious to see this take place. I am-- the character of the country is on the ballot. Our character is on the ballot. Look at us closely.  [1:11:00] Welker: Let me ask them some follow--  [1:11:01] Trump: Excuse me--  [1:11:04] Welker: Please respond and then we’re gonna have follow up questions.  [1:11:05] Trump: If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, a wreck-- If this is true, then he's a corrupt politician. So don't give me the stuff about how you're this innocent baby. Joe, they're calling you a corrupt politician--  [1:11:19] Biden: Nobody says--  [1:11:20] Welker: President Trump, I want to stay on the issue of race. We're talking about the issue--  [1:11:21] Trump: It’s the laptop from hell. The laptop from hell.  [1:11:25] Welker: President Trump, we’re talking about race right now and I do want to speak on the issue of race. President Trump---  [1:11:29] Biden: Nobody-- Kristen, I have to respond to that.  [1:11:30] Welker: Please, very quickly.  [1:11:32] Biden: Look, there are 50 former National Intelligence folks who said that what this, he's accusing me of is a Russian plan. They have said that this has all the characteristics-- four-- five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him, his, and his good friend Rudy Giuliani.  [1:11:51] Trump: You mean, the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax? You gotta be--  [1:11:58] Biden: That’s exactly what-- That’s exactly what--  [1:12:00] Trump: Is this where you’re going? This is where he’s going. The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia?  [1:12:03] Welker: Gentleman, I want to stay on the issue of race, okay--  [1:12:05] Trump: You have to be kidding here. Here we go again with Russia.  [1:12:09] Welker: Mr. President, we're gonna continue on the issue of race. Mr. President, you've described the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of hate. You've shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters. You've said that Black professional athletes exercising their first amendment rights should be fired. What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?  [1:12:32] Trump: Well you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter they were chanting ‘Pigs in a blanket’, talking about police, ‘Pigs, Pigs’, talking about our police, ‘Pigs in a blanket, fry' em like bacon’. I said, ‘That's a horrible thing’. And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter. I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room.  [1:13:03] Welker: What do you say to men who are concerned by that rhetoric?  [1:12:06] Trump: I don't, I don't know what to say. I got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and opportunity zones. I took care of Black colleges and universities. I don't know what to say. They can say anything. I mean, they can say anything. It's a very-- it makes me sad because I am the least racist person. I can't even see the audience because it's so dark, but I don't care who's in the audience. I’m the least racist person in this room.  [1:13:35] Welker: OK. Vice President Biden, let me ask you, very quickly, and then I have a follow up question for you.  [1:13:39] Biden: Abraham Lincoln. Here is one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history. He pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. He started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he’s gonna get rid of those Mexican rapists. He's banned Muslims because they're Muslims. He has moved around and made everything worse across the board. He says to them about the ‘Poor Boys’, last time we were on stage here. He said, ‘I told him to stand down and stand ready’. Come on. This guy has a dog whistle about as big as a fog horn.  [1:14:12] Welker: President Trump, I'm going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then have a follow up question.  [1:14:16] Trump: He made a reference to Abraham Lincoln. Where did that come in? I mean--  [1:14:19] Biden: You said you were Abraham Lincoln.  [1:14:21] Trump: No, no. I said not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the Black community. I didn’t say ‘I'm Abraham Lincoln’. I said, ‘Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done but what I've done for the Black community’. Now you have done nothing other than the crime bill, which put--  [1:14:42] Biden: Oh, God.  [1:14:42] Trump: Tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail. And you know what? They remember it because it you look at what’s happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly. Just take a look at what’s happening out there.  [1:14:50] Welker: All right, let me-- Let me ask Vice President Biden about-- Vice President Biden, let me give you a chance to respond within this context. Crime bill that you supported in the 80s and 90s contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession. They are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, they’re uncles whose families are still to this day, some of them, suffering the consequences. So speak to those families, why should they vote for you?  [1:15:20] Biden: One of the things that is said, in the '80s, we passed 100%, all 100 senators voted for it, a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs. It was a mistake. I've been trying to change it since then, particularly the portion on cocaine. That's why I've been arguing that, in fact, we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense. They should be going into treatment across the board. That's what we should be spending money on. That's why I set up drug courts which were never funded by republican friends. They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem. They should be going into treatment. Treatment. That's what we've been trying to do. That's what I'm going to get done because they may-- the American people have now seen that in fact, it was a mistake to pass those laws where they do the drug. But they were not in the crime bill.  [1:16:12] Trump: But why didn't he get it done? See, it's all talk no action with these politicians. Why didn't he get it? ‘That's what I'm gonna do when I become president’. You were vice president, along with Obama as your President, your leader, for eight years. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years to get it done? Now, you're saying you're gonna get it done because you're all talk and no action, Joe.  [1:16:34] Biden: We got a lot of it done. We released 38,000-- We got 38,000 prisoners left from--  [1:16:39] Trump: You got nothing done  [1:16:40] Biden: 38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison. We have-- there were over 1000 people who were given clemency. We-- in fact, we’re the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern of practice of the police departments and what they were doing, how they were conducting themselves. I could go on, but we began the process. We began the process. We lost an election. That's why I'm running to win back that election and change his terrible policy.  [1:1:08] Trump: I just ask-- I just ask one question: why didn't you do it in the eight years, a short time ago? Why didn't you do it? You just said, ‘I'm going to do that. I'm going to do this.’ You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison. Now you're saying you're going to get-- you're going to undo that. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years with Obama? You know why, Joe, because you're all talk and no action.  [1:17:29] Welker: All right, Vice President Biden and then we're gonna move on to the next section.  [1:17:34] Biden: We had a Republican Congress. That’s the answer.  [1:17:37] Welker: OK.  [1:17:39] Trump: Well, you gotta talk-- you gotta talk 'em into it, Joe. Sometimes you gotta talk ‘em into it.  [1:17:43] Welker: All right, we’re gonna move on to our next section which is climate change-  [1:17:44] Trump: Like I did with criminal justice reform. I had to talk Democrats into it.  On climate change  [1:17:48] Welker: Gentlemen, we’re running out of time so we gotta get on to climate change, please. You both have very different visions on climate change. President Trump, you say that environmental regulations have hurt jobs in the energy sector. Vice President Biden, you have said you see addressing climate change as an opportunity to create new jobs. For each of you, how would you both combat climate change and support job growth at the same time? Starting with you, President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.  [1:18:15] Trump: So we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs. I do love the environment, but what I want the cleanest, crystal clear water, the cleanest air. We have the best, lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time. Not Joe. I haven't heard him use the term because I'm not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it. And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we've had in 35 years. Under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but what we can’t do-- Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India. It's filthy. The air is filthy. The Paris Accord, I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly. When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice. They were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord. It was so unfair. China doesn't kick in until 2030. Russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away. It would-- It would have been-- It would have destroyed our businesses. So, you ready? We have done an incredible job environmentally. We have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we've seen in many, many years.  [1:19:50] Welker: Vice President, Biden--  [1:19:51] Trump: And we haven't destroyed our industries.  [1:19:52] Welker: Vice President Biden, two minutes to you uninterrupted.  [1:19:55] Biden: Climate change, climate warming, global warming is an existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it. And we're told by all the leading scientists in the world that we don't have much time. We're going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years. Four years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up-- to limit the-- limit of admissions will put us in a position where we're going to be in real trouble. Here's where we have a great opportunity, I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as labor, people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan. Because what it does, it will create millions of new, good-paying jobs. We're going to invest in, for example, 500,000-- 50,000, excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market in the future. In the meantime, China's doing that. We're going to be in a position where we're going to see to it that we're going to take 4 million existing billion, buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don't leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating a significant number of jobs. And by the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it's going to create millions of jobs and it's going to clean the environment. Our health and our jobs are at stake. That's what's happening. And we-- right now, by the way, Wall Street firm has indicated that my plan-- My plan will, in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his. This from Wall Street and I’ll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does, not on climate just on the economy.  [1:21:47] Trump: President Trump, your response --  [1:21:48] Trump: They came out and said very strongly, ‘$6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan’, that his plan is an economic disaster. If you look at what he wants to do, you know if you look at his plan, you know, you know who developed it? AOC+3. They know nothing about the climate. I mean, she's got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate. And they're all hopping through hoops for AOC+3. Look, they’re real play costs $100 trillion. If we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years, we would not even come close to a number like that. When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows. As far as they're concerned, if you had no window it would be a lovely thing. This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen. And this wasn't done by smart people. This wasn't done by anybody. Frankly, I don't even know how it can be good politically. They want to spend $100 trillion. That's their real number. He's trying to say it was six. It’s $100 trillion. They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little tiny, small windows and many other things. And many other things--  [1:22:47] Welker: All right-- Okay, let me have the vice president respond and we're running out of time and we have a lot more questions. So let's hear from the Vice President. I have a number of more questions.  [1:23:11] Biden: I don't know where he comes from. I don’t know where he comes up with these numbers. $100 trillion? Give me a break. This plan was-- This plan has been endorsed by every major-- every major environmental group and every labor group. Labor. Because they know the future lies, the future lies in us being able to breath. And they know they're good jobs in getting us there. And by the way, the fastest growing industry in America are--is, is, is the electric--excuse me, solar energy and wind. He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills. It’s the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages, 45-50 bucks an hour. We can grow and we can be cleaner, if we go the route I’m proposing.  [1:24:00] Welker: President Trump-- Please respond and then I have a follow up.  [1:24:00] Trump: Excuse me. We are energy independent for the first time. We don't need all of these countries that we had a fight war over because we needed their energy. We are energy independent. I know more about wind than you do. It’s extremely expensive, kills all the birds, it’s very intermittent. It's got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China. And the fumes coming up-- If you're a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make-- make these massive windmills is more than anything that we're talking about with natural gas, which is very clean. One other thing--  [1:24:36] Biden: Find me a scientist that says that.  [1:24:38] Trump: Solar. I love solar, but solar doesn't quite have it yet. It's not powerful enough yet to-- to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world--  [1:24:47] Biden: False.  [1:24:47] Trump: So, it's all a pipe dream, but you know what we'll do? We're gonna have the greatest economy in the world. But if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry. You want-- And what about fracking?  [1:25:01] Welker: All right. Let me allow Vice President Biden to respond--  [1:25:04] Biden: I have never said I oppose fracking.  [1:25:06] Trump: You said it on tape.  [1:25:08] Biden: I did? Show the tape. Put it on your website.  [1:25:10] Trump: I’ll put it on.  [1:25:11] Biden: Put it on the website. The fact of the matter is he’s flat lying.  [1:25:15] Welker: Would you rule out banning fracking?  [1:25:17] Biden: I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need-- We need other industries to transition to get to, ultimately, a complete zero emissions by 2025. What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking. Capture the emissions from gas. We can do that and we can do that by investing money into-- It's a transition to that.  [1:25:44] Welker: I have one more question--  [1:25:48] Trump: Excuse me. He was against fracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow. ‘I am against fracking’, until he got the nomination, went to Pennsylvania than he said-- You know what, Pennsylvania? He'll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it.  [1:26:00] Biden: Fracking on federal Land, I said. No fracking or oil on federal land--  [1:26:05] Welker: Let me ask this final question in this section and then I want to move on to our final section. President Trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants. In Texas there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick. Your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities. Why should these families give you another four years in office?  [1:26:26] Trump: The families that we're talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they've ever made. If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian, it's nice times greater, the percentage gain than it was under-- in three years-- than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely. Nine times more. Now, somebody lives-- I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you're saying-- But they're making a tremendous amount of money. Economically, we saved it. And I saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. We saved it. We got-- Say what you want of that relationship, we got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back. We saved our oil industry and now it's very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. Remember that.  [1:27:22] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response and then we're going to have a final question for both of you.  [1:27:26] Biden: My response is that those people live on what they call ‘Fence Lines’. He doesn't understand this. They live near chemical plants that, in fact, pollute. Chemical plants, and oil plants and refineries that pollute. I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claremont, Delaware. And all the more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is anyplace, including in Houston at the time. When my mom would get the car when they're first frost to drive me to school, turned on the windshield wipers there’d be oil slick in the window. That's why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer. The fact is those frontline communities, it doesn't matter what you're paying them. It matters how you keep them safe. What do you do? And you impose restrictions on the pollution, that the pollutants coming out of those fenceline communities.  [1:28:12] Welker: OK, I have one final question--  [1:28:14] Trump: Would you close down the-- Would you close down the oil industry?  [1:28:17] Biden: I would transition from the oil industry. Yes.  [1:28:19] Trump: Oh, transition.  [1:28:21] Biden: It is a big statement because I would stop--  [1:28:22] Welker: Why would you do that?  [1:28:24] Biden: Because the oil industry significantly — but here's the deal —  [1:28:27] Trump: That’s a big statement.  [1:28:31] Biden: Well, if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time. Over time. And I’d stop giving to the oil industry-- I’d stop giving them federal subsidies. You won't give federal subsidies to the gas and, excuse me, to solar and wind. Why are we giving it to the oil industry?  [1:28:52] Trump: We actually do give it to solar and wind--  [1:28:54] Welker: All right, we have one final question--  [1:28:56] Trump: That’s the biggest statement. In terms of business. that's the biggest statement.  [1:28:59] Welker: All right, we have one final question-- Mr. President--  [1:29:00] Trump: Because basically what he’s saying is he’s going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania? Oklahoma? Ohio?  [1:29:07] Welker: Vice President Biden, let me give you ten seconds to respond and then I have to get to the final question. Vice President Biden?  [1:29:12] Biden: He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward a net zero emissions. The first place to do that by the year 2025 is in energy production. By 2050, totally.  [1:29:25] Welker: All right. One final question--  [1:29:26] Trump: Is he gonna get China to do it? Is he going to get China to do it?  [1:29:27] Welker: No, we're finished with this. We have to move on to our final question.  [1:29:30] Biden: No, I’m going to rejoin the Paris Accord and get China to abide by what they agreed to  [1:29:33] Trump: But that’ll cost you $1 trillion.  Final question  [1:29:34] Welker: This is about leadership, gentlemen, and this first question does go to you, President Trump.. Imagine this is your Inauguration Day. What will you say in your a\", 'President Donald Trump’s decision to accept 15,000 refugees in 2020 only helps “bigots,” says Catherine Rampell, a pro-migration columnist at the Washington Post.  “The only constituency helped by Trump’s latest cruelty are the bigots and knee-jerk nationalists crafting his policies,” she wrote, under the headline “Trump’s refugee ceiling is bad for everyone but bigots.”  Rampell’s jibe was dismissed by Ann Corcoran, founder of Refugee resettlement Watch, who says the federal importation of refugees expands American poverty, slows technological innovation, and fuels civic conflict. She responded:  There’s no sense trying to argue with [progresives] except to turn it back and say; ‘What about our own poor people? Why aren’t they interested in taking care of our poor Americans? Our homeless? Why are refugees and immigrants somehow cooler and more desirable to take care of than our own poor people? Have we run out of poor Americans to take care of?’ No, clearly, we have not run out of poor Americans.  On September 10, the Washington Post reported on poverty in high-immigration, low-wage Florida:  After the power went out at the Star [hotel], Rose’s family spent the last of their savings on a week’s stay at the Magic Castle [hotel], where the rooms were going for $39 a night. The plan was to buy time until they could come up with a plan. Her stepfather had applied for a dishwashing job at Chili’s but didn’t get it. Rose was temporarily out of work, too. One of the employees on her shift at Taco Bell had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, and she couldn’t go back to work until she proved she was virus free. … Finally, in early September, Rose’s parents found a way out, at least for now. A Kissimmee-based real estate agent, who provides aid to motel families and had helped them in the past, paid $3,000 in deposits and application fees for an extended-stay suite in a run-down resort community. Their new landlord agreed to overlook the fact that Rose’s parents had poor credit and had just started new $9-an-hour fast food jobs.  In February 2020, Breitbart News reported an investor-funded study which showed that the exclusion of migrant labor would help raise wages for Floridians:  The biggest winners from the E-Verify bill would be the least paid, least educated workers in the economy, said the study by Rick Harper, an economist formerly at the University of West Florida. “Those are the most likely to be substituted by employers hiring new workers when there is some competition” from illegal workers, wrote Harper, who now works with Triumph Gulf Coast Inc. to invest public funds in Florida. The law would also help narrow the income gap between the least educated and better educated workers, said the FWD.us report. The current shortage of workers already “has reduced the size of the difference in wages paid to less-educated workers versus well-educated workers … by 6 to 9 percent,” Harper wrote.  Many refugees work in retail stores or in hotels where labor can comprise 50 percent of costs. But they add chaotic diversity to already-damaged towns, even as they also nudge down national productivity.  Before Trump, the large inflow of cheap and compliant refugee labor also allowed meatpacking plants to minimize investment in labor-saving, wealth-producing machinery. But Trump’s curb on refugees pressured meatpacking companies to invest heavily in automation, according to the Wall Street Journal:  At Pilgrim’s Pride Corp., the second-biggest U.S. chicken processor and majority-owned by JBS, deboning machines now trail humans by only 1% to 1.5%, in terms of meat yield per chicken. “They are much closer to what the person can do than seven years ago,” Mr. Nogueira said. Technology and automation are part of the $1 billion in capital expenditures JBS USA has planned for 2020. “One day we will be there, but we are not there yet,” he said.  “There’s no question they’ve been avoiding the automation that would make everything more efficient and cost-effective,” said Corcoran.  The accelerating shift toward automation caused by rising wages will reduce corporations’ continued use of stoop labor in the field, reduce disease threats to migrants and Americans, preserve family farms, transfer wealth back from the coasts to the heartland, and help Americans keep up with Chinese, Japanese, and Icelandic automation.  A shift toward automation will also help the many Midwestern towns now dominated by cheap labor meatpacking plants, she said.  Moreover, even a ramped-up importation of 100,000 refugees each year could only help a tiny share of refugees around the world, said Corcoran. The best way to help the most refugees is to spend U.S. resources in their own country, she said. “If f you want to take care of these poor people, go to where they live in the world.”  Joe Biden is promising to spike refugee inflows above 100,000 per year.  Advocates for migration are eager to claim moral superiority over the Americans who want to help Americans, said Corcoran. “They believe we’re bigots — that’s what they’ve been saying for decades — but they know big business uses these refugees to keep wages low,” she said.  Rampell’s claim of moral superiority is wrapped up in her establishment claim about America as a “Nation of Immigrants.” She wrote:  The United States has taken in those huddled masses yearning to breathe free because, first and foremost, doing so reflects American values. We like to consider our nation a city upon a hill for those fleeing religious persecution, political violence, genocide, tyranny; Americans are a people blessed and generous enough to offer refuge to some of the world’s most vulnerable. Just what this country offered so many generations of immigrants before, including many of our own ancestors.  In reality, numerous polls show that Americans really prefer that jobs and wages to first go to fellow Americans before the jobs got to additional migrants. For most Americans and immigrants, America is a nation of Americans.  So the hidden agenda for Rampell and many others progressives is political ambition, not charity, Corcoran said. “The bottom line is that these immigrants vote for Democrats,” she said.  “Big business gets the cheap labor, the Democrats get the voters, and Americans get hammered with this humanitarian [B.S.],” she said.', 'With the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, President Trump will have the rare chance to appoint a third justice to the highest court in the country.  Having remained on her seat for just over 27 years, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the 24th longest-serving Supreme Court justice of the 114 to hold the office. While the longest-serving justice was William O. Douglas’ 36 years, 209 days span – lasting through the 40s, 50s, and 60s - the average term of service is 16 years, 359 days.  As the standard of health care continues to improve, a justice can potentially look forward to a longer tenure. To get an idea of how long that tenure might last, here is a rundown of the current justices and just how long each of them has served so far.  CLARENCE THOMAS, 72  Nominated by President George H.W. Bush, Justice Clarence Thomas is the longest-serving member currently sitting on the bench. Even before Ginsburg’s death, Thomas was the longest-serving member with a tenure of 28 years, 332 days, having been confirmed on October 15th, 1991. His confirmation took 99 days, which happens to also be the longest time to confirm a justice.  Thomas is perhaps the most right-leaning justice on the court, according to an analysis by political scientists Lee Epstein, Andrew D. Martin and Kevin Quinn. Prior to the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Thomas had gone a full decade without asking any questions, a rare record since no justice for 45 years prior had gone a single term without asking questions during cases, according to the New York Times.  STEPHEN G. BREYER, 82  Nominated by President Bill Clinton, Justice Stephen G. Breyer’s term is just a bit shorter than that of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was also appointed by Clinton during his first term. Breyer has served for 26 years, 47 days so far, having been confirmed on July 29, 1994, with his confirmation taking 73 days to complete.  With Ginsburg’s passing, Breyer is now the oldest justice on the bench at 82-years-old-- a full decade older than Thomas. Breyer is a left-leaning justice, though more moderate than the other liberal justices. Breyer is also a more philosophical justice, having published a book, Active Liberty, in 2005 which attempted to lay out a systematic explanation of his approach to legal theory.  SAMUEL ALITO, 70  The first appointee by President George W. Bush has enjoyed a tenure just a few months longer than that of his junior – and chief justice – John Roberts. Samuel Alito was appointed on January 31, 2006 after a process lasting 82 days. He is only a little younger than Clarence Thomas, but has served for only half as long as the longest-serving member on the bench.  Alito is more conservative than the chief justice, but he is still considered more moderate than his fellow conservative-leaning justices. He considers himself a “practical originalist\" -- meaning he believes that the constitution’s fundamental meaning does not change. His actual practice, though, gives more emphasis to the “practical” use of the laws that the court reviews. He does, however, vote more often than not for a conservative interpretation, per analysis by 538.  JOHN ROBERTS, 65  Current Chief Justice John Roberts, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, has served just 134 days longer than that of the other Bush appointee, Justice Alito. Confirmed on Sept. 29, 2005, Roberts has served for 14 years, 356 days, with his confirmation taking 62 days to complete.  Roberts’ confirmation was an unusual one, as Bush initially nominated Roberts to replace Associate Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, but then withdrew the nomination following the death of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. Bush then nominated Roberts for Chief Justice, a position held by only 16 people before him. The majority of chief justices are directly nominated, with only five having previously served as associate justices.  Roberts is considered a moderate, despite being originally appointed under the assumption that he would be a more conservative justice. Roberts occasionally sides with more liberal justices, such as earlier in 2020 when he voted to preserve Obama-era protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children. Roberts has expressed a view for judicial restraint to support legal legitimacy of the court as a prime motivator for his decision-making and interpretation.  SONIA SOTOMAYOR, 66  Appointed by President Barack Obama at the start of his first term, Sotomayor was confirmed on Aug. 6, 2009 after a 66-day process. Sotomayor is the first - and so far only – Hispanic appointment to the Supreme Court. Her ascent was aided by both sides of the aisle, with President George H.W. Bush first appointing her to the Southern District of New York before President Bill Clinton elevated her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  Sotomayor also now holds the distinction as the most left-leaning justice on the Supreme Court. Her 11-year tenure has seen her voting in near-lockstep with Ginsburg. She has been cited as a “legal realist,” a position best summed up as believing that “the life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience.\"  ELENA KAGAN, 60  The second Obama appointee arrived a little over a year later. Elena Kagan was confirmed on August 5, 2010, following a rather lengthy process of 87 days. Her tenure has lasted just over a decade now, but that still leaves her as the third-most junior member on the bench.  Kagan appears to vote only a little more left-leaning than Breyer. Kagan served as Associate White House Counsel for President Bill Clinton, working on such cases as the Whitewater controversy. In 1997, she co-authored a plea for Clinton to support a ban on late-term abortions as part of a political compromise.  NEIL GORSUCH, 53  The first appointment by President Trump saw Neil Gorsuch fill a vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. While Scalia died during the last year of Obama’s presidency, the Senate held off on hearing appointments until Trump took office.  Once the process started, it took 65 days to confirm Gorsuch on April 7, 2017, starting a tenure that has lasted three years, 162 days. Gorsuch also holds the distinction of being the first justice to serve alongside a justice for whom he has clerked – Justice Anthony Kennedy. He is currently the youngest justice on the bench.  Gorsuch has been a more conservative voice on the bench, falling in the middle of the right-leaning pack. He has at times voted more liberally, but he supports textualism and originalism when interpreting the constitution.  BRETT KAVANAUGH, 55  While his tenure is currently the shortest, Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation process was the second-longest of the current justices. Appointed in 2018, his confirmation hearing lasted for 88 days before he was appointed on October 6, 2018. He is the second appointee by President Trump.  Kavanaugh quickly established himself as one of the most conservative justices on the bench, second only to Thomas. Despite his overall record, he has taken a few surprise positions, such as voting in favor of the Manhattan District Attorney gaining access to Trump’s tax records. His record at times indicates an emphasis on the distinction between rulings that should be within the court’s purview versus that of Congress.', 'ANNAPOLIS, Md. — Maryland\\'s Republican Gov. Larry Hogan wrote-in former President Ronald Reagan on the ballot he mailed in last week rather than vote for either President Donald Trump or his Democratic challenger Joe Biden.  The news, which was first reported Friday by The Washington Post, was confirmed on Twitter later that day by Hogan\\'s communications director Mike Ricci.  \"I know it’s simply symbolic. It’s not going to change the outcome in my state. But I thought it was important to just cast a vote that showed the kind of person I’d like to see in office,\" Hogan told the Post.  Hogan, a fierce critic of the president, did not vote for Trump in 2016 either, writing in his father, Larry Hogan, Sr., instead of voting for Trump or Hillary Clinton that year. Hogan told the Post he considered Reagan \"my hero in politics\" along with his father, Larry Hogan Sr., a three-term Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives.  GOP defectors:Here are the prominent Republicans not supporting Trump, and those who are supporting Biden  Hogan, who is nearing the end of his second and final term, broke with Trump on a number of issues after he became president, including immigration, and he considered a primary challenge against the president before ruling against it in June 2019.  The Maryland governor has been especially vocal in his condemnation of Trump\\'s response to the coronavirus pandemic, at one point purchasing 500,000 COVID-19 test kits directly from South Korea because he felt the federal government had left the governors to fend for themselves.  Other sitting Republican governors who said they will not vote for Trump include Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker and Vermont Gov. Phil Scott.', \"As we head toward the first presidential debate on Tuesday, two things are true. The U.S. economy, as measured by gross domestic product, is in decline. The second thing is that, as proven by the latest Latino Donor Collaborative U.S. Latino GDP Report, the world’s leading growth economy is right here in America. Now the question is, will Joe Biden or President Donald Trump leverage this advantage?  Even before the coronavirus struck, the economy was in trouble. Workforce growth rate has been in decline; small businesses continue to struggle, the number of people employed in manufacturing has declined; family farm bankruptcies are at an eight-year high; real wages for American workers have barely budged; and we’re even losing in the trade war as China’s trade surplus with the U.S. has grown almost 25 percent since Trump became president.  As we look ahead, we need to talk about how to catalyze our economy and return to the growth we have experienced in the past.  In contrast, some of our strongest GDP growth occurred during the Reagan years. President Ronald Reagan understood the value of encouraging investment in areas of growth and welcoming immigrants to supplement our existing workforce so we could increase goods and services production while creating more jobs. During President Bill Clinton's administration, GDP growth was even higher. Trump was not on track to match either president, even before Covid-19 hit.  So as we look ahead, we need to talk about how to catalyze our economy and return to the growth we have experienced in the past. How do we do that? By leveraging the cohort that is growing dramatically faster than all others, creating new businesses at a faster pace, employing millions of Americans, supplying the most productive labor force and leading consumption. That is the U.S. Latino cohort, which has become, right here within our own country, a world-leading economy.  The new Latino Donor Collaborative U.S. Latino GDP Report shows the U.S. Latino cohort is already equivalent to the eighth largest economy in the world. In fact, according to the report, U.S. Latino GDP is now at $2.6 trillion, an 8.7 percent growth rate from 2017 to 2018. That’s a growth rate outpacing India and China. Given its trajectory, U.S. Latino GDP is poised to surpass France, the U.K. and India — possibly within the next five years.  This unprecedented economic growth train left the station back in 2005 and has been gaining speed ever since. More and more U.S. Latinos are becoming old enough to work each year, adding to the millions already working, plus workers from previous generations are moving into higher-income roles. Meanwhile, the education rate is dramatically increasing every year, incomes are growing and driving consumption and the result is consistent GDP growth.  The good news is the economic momentum of the U.S. Latino cohort has so far been able to overcome the headwinds it has faced from anti-immigration policies and anti-Latino rhetoric. Making this growth even more remarkable is that the U.S. Latino cohort is one of the most under-capitalized cohorts in our country, and therein lies our unparalleled opportunity.  Asset management firms, CEOs, corporate boards, nonprofits, everyone responsible for managing assets for returns, investing assets for returns and allocating resources for returns should begin deploying their capital where the growth is in our economy: the U.S. Latino cohort. This is our nation’s differentiating competitive advantage versus other large, aging economies. It is illogical to not be investing in this cohort that is catalyzing growth in every part of our economy, whether they are our essential workers, entrepreneurs, business owners or professionals. They are enabling our competitiveness, providing health care, expanding our culture and improving the quality of life for all Americans in our country.  As a capitalist, it is imperative, in my opinion, that capitalism in our country move now from working for just “the few” to working for “the many.” That means making certain the U.S. Latino cohort is catalyzed even further through access and connections to capital, especially getting money into the hands of Latino-owned small businesses and entrepreneurs, as well as the hands of U.S. Latino-founded funds so they can grow and invest more knowledgeably in this cohort, while at the same time making certain that U.S. Latinos are active in the most senior positions on boards of directors and in C-suites.  While U.S. Latinos make up nearly 20 percent of our population, they make up only around 4 percent of this country’s executive ranks, and less than 3 percent of directors on Fortune 500 boards are Latino. A logical growth strategy for our country, in addition to increasing capital flow, must include increasing the number of U.S. Latinos in boardrooms and executive offices to 15 percent within the next five years.  An axiom in business is that leadership in boards must understand their customers and the markets they serve. Therefore, U.S. Latino representation on boards is key to understanding and serving this leading growth cohort. Leadership that understands its growing customer base is essential to catalyzing profitable growth, growing employee wages and increasing shareholder return.  As a capitalist, it is imperative, in my opinion, that capitalism in our country move now from working for just “the few” to working for “the many.”  The additional return on investing in this cohort should also be clear to the millions of baby boomers who are leaving the workforce yearly, and the Gen X folks following them, because it is this U.S. Latino cohort that will have the largest responsibility for paying taxes that sustain the Social Security and Medicare programs retirees are counting on.  When capital flows to where the growth is, wealth creation occurs. The more people creating wealth, the greater the growth of an economy. That’s how capitalism works in an economy, and by broadening the flow of capital to the U.S. Latino cohort and engaging U.S. Latinos at the highest levels, we as a country can catalyze the world-leading growth of this cohort even further, expanding our competitive advantage and attracting investors worldwide.  Like so many U.S. Latinos, my family roots in this country go back 500 years, well before the Mayflower landed. So this month, when I see celebrations of Hispanic Heritage Month, I personally am celebrating the United States of America, and with the latest facts and data about what the U.S. Latino cohort means for my country, this is a celebration and opportunity from which all Americans should find enjoyment and benefit.\", 'We\\'re told that Joe Biden is our president-elect and he will shuffle into the White House in January with something called a \"mandate.\" If that\\'s true, what exactly is he going to do with this mandate?  That\\'s an interesting question, but almost no one is asking it. Instead, our news media is busy swarming Rudy Giuliani, a former mayor who hasn\\'t held public office in decades, because he has questions about some of the voting that took place last week. Therefore, he\\'s an imminent threat to the republic requiring blanket coverage.  But whatever you do, do not cover the guy that you claim is president. The Biden people are fine with this, by the way. They don\\'t want to deal with the media either, so they\\'re not. On Tuesday, Ryan Lizza of Politico noticed \"[D]iscouraging signs about the Biden team and press access so far.  \"[N]o regular transition briefings, no readout of calls with foreign leaders ... no open press access to the candidate and his people,\" Lizza wrote. \"This is a break with tradition.\"  Of course, it is a break with tradition and it\\'s worrisome, but you\\'re not allowed to notice it. Biden supporters immediately screamed at Ryan Lizza to shut up. So what exactly is going on behind this news blackout veiling Joe Biden from public view? Well, pretty much exactly what you expect: They are busy rewarding the forces of repression that made these election results possible.  Guess who\\'s first in line? You guessed it, the tech monopolies. They did their job. They shutdown one side, protected the other. And now it\\'s time for the reward. In one of his first acts as president elect, Joe Biden named a man called Ron Klain to be his chief of staff. Now, Klain worked for Biden before and is a close ally. That\\'s the story that you\\'ve read about why he got the job.  But that\\'s not why he got the job. Ron Klain is also a lobbyist for Big Tech. Four years ago, he joined the executive council of Silicon Valley\\'s lobbying arm in Washington. Ron Klain was not chosen for his success as a public servant. We know that because last year, he acknowledged that the Obama administration, where he was a senior official, totally mishandled the swine flu pandemic, the one that came before this one.  FLASHBACK: BIDEN\\'S CHIEF OF STAFF PICK ADMITS OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DID EVERYTHING WRONG WITH H1N1  \"It’s just purely a fortuity that this isn’t one of the great mass casualty events in American history, Ron Klain conceded with admirable bluntness. \"It had nothing to do with us doing anything right, it just had to do with luck.”  What\\'s amazing is that despite uttering the above quote, somehow Ron Klain managed to become Joe Biden\\'s advisor on the coronaviruses pandemic. And from the first day, he got that wrong, too. Here\\'s Klain in late January, explaining that President Trump\\'s ban on travel from China, where the virus came from, was a very bad idea.  QUESTION: Would you ban Chinese travelers from arriving in the United States?  KLAIN: I wouldn\\'t. I think that\\'s premature. I think it\\'s [a] very important exchange, very important for trade and tourism.  That is to say, Silicon Valley\\'s bottom line means you can\\'t annoy or inconvenience China. And then Klain kept going. On Feb. 28, he tweeted this: \"On #COVID-19: If you want to do something useful today, go to Chinatown -- buy a meal, go shopping. The virus attacks humans, not people of any ethnicity/race. Fear is hurting Chinese-American owned businesses, baselessly. Let\\'s fight the disease AND let\\'s fight prejudice.\"  Keep in mind, at the moment Klain wrote that, there were no attacks against Chinese-Americans because of the coronavirus, because the U.S. is a deeply decent, non-racist country. So why was he saying this? It turns out the Chinese government was saying almost exactly the same thing: If you\\'re worried about the coronavirus, you\\'re a bigot.  But again, it doesn\\'t matter whether Ron Klain was right about how to handle the coronavirus. What matters is that Ron Klain is on the right side of Silicon Valley. As we\\'ve told you before, this is not an incoming presidential administration. This is a corporate takeover of the country. Joe Biden\\'s transition advisers include executives from Uber, Visa, Capital One, Airbnb, Amazon, the Chan Zuckerberg Foundation and the nonprofit run by Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Are you surprised? No, you\\'re not.  BIDEN TRANSITION REVEALS \\'AGENCY REVIEW TEAMS\\' AMID SPAT OVER TRANSFER OF POWER  According to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal, at least 40 members of the Biden transition team announced earlier this week either were or are registered lobbyists. You won\\'t be shocked to learn that the government of China looks on at all this and is highly pleased. A weak, divided America obsessed with narcissistic identity politics is good for them and very different from them.  In the United States, we\\'re told your identity is the most important thing. They don\\'t think that in China, in China, they think their country is the most important thing. And that\\'s why they\\'re winning. On Election Day, markets in China crashed when returns showed Donald Trump leading in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The Chinese currency plunged 1.4% against the dollar early Wednesday morning, the largest single-day drop in nearly three years. And then when the news changed, when votes started coming in for Joe Biden, the Chinese markets immediately recovered. Was there a connection? You bet there was. The Chinese government is happy now.  Joe Biden has announced that as president he will not deport a single illegal alien from this country in his first 100 days. It doesn\\'t matter who they are, it doesn\\'t matter what they\\'ve done. It doesn\\'t matter whether they were convicted of crimes such as rape and murder or not. Literally, they can all stay here.  This is great news if you\\'re Silicon Valley. The tech companies wanted this because they rely on cheap labor. But for the rest of us, what\\'s the upside exactly? By the way, if you live anywhere along the U.S.-Mexico border, good luck to you. Also, don\\'t bother locking your doors or pining for a border wall or thinking that immigration restrictions might improve your life.  EX-ICE CHIEF HOMAN: \\'IT\\'S TERRIBLE WHAT\\'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN\\' AT BORDER UNDER BIDEN  If Democrats wind up controlling the Senate, they will give amnesty to every illegal alien in this country. That\\'s more than 20 million people, and they\\'ll be on a pathway to citizenship immediately. We know that because Joe Biden\\'s already called for it.  BIDEN, SPEAKING DURING SECOND PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: Within 100 days, I’m going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people. And all of those so-called dreamers, those DACA kids, they’re going to be immediately certified again to be able to stay in this country and put on a path to citizenship.  You know how you know they\\'re lying? Because no one who knows anything about the subject thinks it\\'s \"11 million undocumented people.\" No, the number is more than 20 million. Think about more than 20 million new American citizens in one day.  That would be the biggest change of our lifetimes, but it\\'s just the beginning. \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" has exclusively obtained a memo from the Glover Park Group, a lucrative Washington lobbying shop with ties to Joe Biden.  The memo outlines Biden\\'s chief priorities, including financial aid for illegal aliens, a big increase in refugee resettlement, and more taxpayer funding for critical race theory indoctrination.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Who is for this stuff? Well, America\\'s unhappy rich ladies. They\\'re the ones who got Biden elected, and they love this stuff. It comes at no cost to them and it makes them feel virtuous. But what policies like that do for everyone else? How does resettling refugees in the country and critical race theory make the middle class more secure, happier or richer? How does it put your kids through college?  The answer, of course, is that it doesn\\'t. It doesn\\'t do anything for anyone else, but who cares?

HRC states in its “blueprint” that Biden could enact some of its policy recommendations fairly quickly through executive orders that would simply cancel Trump’s actions:  Since taking office, the Trump administration has consistently targeted far reaching regulatory changes that undermine the rights of vulnerable communities, including those who are LGBTQ. The administration consistently mischaracterizes the law in federal regulations, legal memorandums, and litigation actions. These coordinated attacks on civil rights exploit the public’s traditionally limited engagement with federal legal actions and administrative developments, violating the public trust.  HRC has laid out a roadmap to working with the Biden-Harris administration and ensuring we move equality forward by advancing policies to improve the lives of millions of LGBTQ Americans. Take a look. ⤵️ https://t.co/5N1CRkerjO — Human Rights Campaign (@HRC) November 11, 2020  Among its 85 policy recommendations for a Biden administration, HRC is urging:  HIV-positive individuals to be allowed into the military  the release of transgender illegal immigrants  pervasive implementation of the Supreme Court’s decision in June in Bostock v.

Beijing’s exhortation comes amid mounting evidence that the Communist Party has imprisoned as many as 3 million ethnic minorities in concentration camps in an effort to erase them from society.  “The Chinese delegation wishes to recommend to the U.S. [the following]: … Root out systematic racism, address widespread police brutality and combat discrimination against African- and Asian-Americans,” Beijing’s representative said at the U.N. Human Rights Council (UNHRC) on Monday during the body’s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of the United States’ human rights record.  🇳 China, newly elected to the U.N. Human Rights Council, just reviewed the U.S. human rights record. \"China wishes to recommend to the U.S.:  1. Root out systematic racism, address widespread police brutality and combat discrimination against African- and Asian-Americans….“ pic.twitter.com/q2AUSKPTWZ — UN Watch (@UNWatch) November 11, 2020  The UPR is a “unique process which involves a review of the human rights records of all U.N. Member States,” the UNHRC explains on its official website. “The UPR is a State-driven process, under the auspices of the Human Rights Council, which provides the opportunity for each State to declare what actions they have taken to improve the human rights situations in their countries and to fulfil their human rights obligations.”  Testimonies from people who have escaped China’s Xinjiang concentration camp system suggest that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has imprisoned 1 million to 3 million ethnic minorities, mostly Uyghurs, in concentration camps in the past four years in northwestern Xinjiang. Satellite evidence indicates that the CCP began building the camps around 2017. The CCP refers to the camps as “vocational training centers” meant to educate prisoners, but survivors say they endured or witnessed extreme torture, indoctrination, rape, forced sterilization, and other crimes against humanity.  The culture of Xinjiang’s native minorities differs greatly from that of China’s ruling ethnic Han majority. Uyghurs, Kyrgyz, and Kazakhs are majority Sunni Muslim and speak Turkic languages. The CCP views Xinjiang’s cultural differences as a threat to the party’s dominant power, which is consolidated within the ethnic Han culture. The party has resorted to extreme measures to assimilate Xinjiang’s minorities into Han culture through its detention camp system. Survivors of the camps say they were subjected to Communist Party political indoctrination, forced into slave labor, and endured physical and sexual abuse, among other human rights abuses.  Xinjiang’s Turkic ethnic groups are not the only minorities targeted by CCP discrimination. Human rights watchers have accused the Communist Party of racist attitudes and actions against African immigrants in China as well. Authorities in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou in April enforced evictions of African migrants residing in the city for work, citing unfounded concern from locals that black people were more likely to carry and transmit the Chinese coronavirus than Han Chinese people. Municipal CCP officials allowed local business owners to deny Africans entry to hotels, forcing many to sleep on the street.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday addressed China and other nations’ rebuke of the U.S. human rights record at the U.N. on Monday.  “Brutal regimes shouting the loudest about our record have the most to hide about their abysmal records,” Pompeo said at a press conference.

We may receive a commission through The Points Guy affiliate network if you apply and are approved for a card, but our reporting is always independent and objective.  With travel slowly starting to get back on its feet and people thinking about their next vacation — even if it’s not for another year from now — the brand-new sign-up offers on the two IHG hotel credit cards might be just what you’re looking for if you want to earn a ton of points to use toward that trip you’re daydreaming about.  The IHG Rewards Club Premier Credit Card is currently offering a whopping 140,000 bonus points after spending $3,000 on the card within the first three months of account opening, while the no-annual-fee IHG Rewards Club Traveler Credit Card is offering 100,000 bonus points after spending just $2,000 on the card within the same time frame.  Although the IHG Premier card comes with an $89 annual fee, the fee is waived for the first year, which makes this our recommended card between the two options — as long as you can meet the higher $3,000 minimum spending requirement. Not only will you earn more points from the welcome offer, you’ll also get many more benefits, making the card much more desirable.  If you’re unfamiliar with the hotel properties that fall within the IHG umbrella, they include brands such as Holiday Inn, Hotel Indigo, Kimpton, Crowne Plaza and high-end InterContinental Hotels. And with the IHG Premier card, you’ll earn up to a whopping 25 points in total for every dollar you spend at these and other IHG hotels, along with 2 points per dollar on purchases at gas stations, grocery stores and restaurants and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases.  On the other hand, the no-annual-fee IHG Traveler card earns up to 15 points in total for every dollar spent at IHG properties, and the same number of points as the IHG Premier Card in all the other categories.  While the number of points you’ll earn for your IHG stays with either of these two cards is better than any other credit card out there, you can probably get more rewards in the other bonus categories and on everyday purchases with a different card. But the real value of these cards comes down to their benefits, so let’s take a look at how either card can work for IHG loyalists.  Benefits of the IHG credit cards  Elite status at IHG properties  IHG Premier credit card holders automatically receive complimentary IHG Platinum elite status. Although IHG Platinum status isn’t the best hotel status around, having some sort of elite status when you walk in the front door of a hotel is better than no status at all.  One of the main benefits of holding IHG Platinum status — or any IHG status — is that your points will never expire. Typically, IHG points expire if there’s no account activity within a 12-month time frame. IHG is very strict with this policy, so not having to worry about your points expiring is a great benefit.  The IHG Traveler card, on the other hand, will only earn you Gold elite status if you spend $10,000 per calendar year on the card. Truthfully, we don’t recommend spending this amount of money on the card solely for this benefit.  A reward night every year with the IHG Premier  Starting with your first IHG Premier card anniversary (meaning one year from the date you originally get the card), every year you’ll receive a reward night certificate to redeem at a qualifying IHG hotel. Now, this certificate can’t be used at every IHG property — it’s capped at hotels costing up to 40,000 IHG Rewards points. But IHG has recently moved to variable pricing for its awards, so depending on when you travel, you might be able to use these certificates at some very high-end properties.  Even under the old IHG chart, some notable properties where this certificate can be redeemed include the InterContinental Hotel Lisbon, the InterContinental Fiji Golf Resort & Spa, the Holiday Inn Resort Aruba and the Hotel Indigo San Diego Del Mar, just to name a few. During peak dates, these hotels can be quite pricey if you’re paying for them in cash, giving you excellent value with this perk.  With the certificate alone, you’re already coming out well ahead of the annual fee. And if your significant other also has an IHG Premier card, you can put the certificates from both cards together to get a nice weekend getaway by booking the reward nights back to back.  Just know that this is a benefit that only comes with the IHG Premier card, not the IHG Traveler card. So even after the first year, you might find paying the extra $89 is well worth it solely for the reward night certificate.  A complimentary fourth night with either card  The Holiday Inn Resort Aruba-Beach. PHOTO: IHG Hotels  All card holders of both the IHG Premier credit card and the IHG Traveler credit card get a complimentary fourth night when redeeming points at an IHG hotel. There are no exclusions to this benefit — this perk can be extended to any IHG property, regardless of the number of points it costs.  For example, let’s say you’re looking to stay at the Holiday Inn Resort Aruba right near Palm Beach in Aruba at a cost of 40,000 points per night. Thanks to this benefit, you can redeem just 120,000 points for a full four-night stay at this hotel. That means with the card’s sign-up bonus alone, you can be well on your way to enjoying the sunny Caribbean for no additional cost.  Global Entry or TSA PreCheck fee credit with the IHG Premier  When you apply for either the Global Entry or TSA PreCheck trusted traveler programs, just pay with your IHG Premier credit card and your application fee up to $100 will be reimbursed in full. The TSA PreCheck program gets you through TSA security faster at US airports, while Global Entry expedites going through immigration when you return to the US from being overseas.  Even if you already have one of these memberships, you can always use your IHG Premier to pay for a friend or family member’s application fee and you’ll still receive the reimbursement — the name on the Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application doesn’t need to match the name on the credit card. And you can receive this fee reimbursement once every four years.  This isn’t a perk that comes with the IHG Traveler card, which is another reason why the benefits of the IHG Premier card outweigh the annual fee difference.  Cell phone protection with both cards  If you pay for your cell phone bill with either your IHG Premier or IHG Traveler card, you’ll automatically be covered in case your cell phone is stolen or damaged. This is an extremely valuable perk, and one that isn’t too common yet among reward credit cards — especially a card that comes with no annual fee, such as the IHG Traveler.  With the IHG Premier, you can be reimbursed up to $800 per claim, while the IHG Traveler will reimburse you up to $600 per claim. Both cards are capped at $1,000 in reimbursements per year and a maximum of two claims in a rolling 12-month period. With both cards, you’ll also be charged a $50 deductible per claim.  Should you consider the IHG credit cards?  If you stay at IHG hotels even a couple times a year, we recommend either the IHG Premier or the IHG Traveler for their benefits, but not for using on everyday purchases. That’s because you can earn more rewards — either cash back or points — with other credit cards.  For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card earns 2 points for every dollar you spend on travel and dining, but Chase points are worth at least twice as much as IHG points. Even on CNN Underscored’s benchmark credit card, the Citi® Double Cash Card, you’ll earn 2% cash back — 1% when you make a purchase, and another 1% when you pay it off — on everything you buy. Since IHG points are only worth 0.5 cents apiece, according to The Points Guy, you’re getting a 12.5% return on spending at IHG hotels with the IHG Premier card but only a 1% return in the 2x bonus categories.  If you’re trying to determine which card to apply for, we recommend the IHG Premier card over the IHG Traveler card for most travelers. Since the IHG Premier waives its annual fee for the first year, you’re essentially earning an extra 40,000 bonus points from its higher sign-up offer without paying anything extra in year one. With IHG points worth 0.5 cents apiece, that’s another $200 toward IHG hotels, plus you’re getting all the enhanced benefits for 12 months.  And after the first year, if you decide you don’t want to pay an annual fee for the card, you can always downgrade to the IHG Traveler and skip the annual fee going forward.  Now, if you don’t spend a lot of time at IHG hotels, these probably aren’t the right credit cards for you, since you won’t be able to take advantage of the best benefits and perks of either of them. If that’s the case, check our our guide to the best credit cards of 2020 to find a card that’s more suitable for your needs.  Apply now to maximize the sign-up bonus  A room at the IHG InterContinental Hotel in Lisbon. PHOTO: IHG Hotels  With some other credit cards, you’ll find that the value mostly comes from the sign-up offer. But not these cards. The IHG credit cards are ones you’ll likely want to hold on to for years to come thanks to their benefits — even for the occasional IHG traveler.  In the first year alone, with the IHG Premier card, you’ll end up with 140,000 bonus points after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first three months of account opening — valued at $700 according to The Points Guy — plus a Global Entry or TSA PreCheck reimbursement, which is worth up to another $100.  And starting with the second year, you’ll receive a reward night certificate valued at up to $200 since the certificate works at IHG properties that cost up to 40,000 points per night. Add in all of the other benefits of being a card holder — such as your complimentary fourth night and Platinum elite status — and for just an $89 fee, you should find it very easy to come out ahead if you use IHG hotels on any regular basis.  Finally, those who have the old IHG Rewards Club Select Card (which is no longer available to new applicants) aren’t disqualified from getting the IHG Premier card and bonus offer. And if you have both cards, you’re able to reap the benefits of both at the same time and get even greater value from being a card holder. Just keep in mind that since this is a Chase credit card, all applicants are subject to Chase’s “5/24” rule, which means if you’ve gotten five or more credit cards from all banks in the past 24 months, Chase will automatically deny your application.  So if you’ve been considering either of these cards, grab them now with the highest offer we’ve seen to date and score a sweet haul of bonus points to use at IHG hotels around the world — either in the near future or down the line.

The 2019 rule, which gives officials more power to deny permanent residency to applicants the government deems rely or could rely on public benefits like food stamps or housing vouchers, was blocked in late July by a federal judge who found it was hampering efforts to contain the virus.  Citing declarations by doctors and local officials who said immigrants across the country feared they could jeopardize their immigration status by seeking medical treatment and government aid during the pandemic, Judge George Daniels blocked the policy\\'s implementation for the duration of the national coronavirus emergency.  Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox  However, subsequent orders by the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, including one earlier this month, limited and ultimately suspended Daniels\\' ruling, allowing the Trump administration to again enforce the public charge test.  In updated guidance on its website on Tuesday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said it would apply the 2019 public charge test to all future and pending green card applications filed after February 24, 2020, when the agency implemented the rule following the Supreme Court\\'s green light. Applications filed after Daniels\\' injunction in July that have been approved will not be re-adjudicated, USCIS said.  The \"public charge\" standard was first included in U.S. law in the early 1880s, when the U.S. government began to restrict and regulate immigration at the federal level, including by banning Chinese immigrants under the premise that they \"endangered the good order\" of certain American communities. The term \"public charge\" essentially means being an economic burden on the country.  While the test was used for decades to prohibit the entry of certain low-income immigrants and, in some cases, to deport them, its definition was expanded by the Trump administration\\'s 2019 rule, which superseded Clinton-era guidance that instructed officials to only deem immigrants public charges if they were receiving government cash benefits or long-term institutionalized care.  The 2019 rule broadened the type and amount of benefits that count against immigrants seeking to stay in or move to the U.S., requiring immigration caseworkers to consider enrollment in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), certain federally funded Medicaid benefits, and a variety of forms of government-subsidized housing, including Section 8 vouchers.  Advocates have strongly criticized the policy, pointing to research about the \"chilling effect\" it has had on immigrant households that fear the consequences of accessing government benefits, including those comprised of green card holders and U.S. citizens, who are not subject to the public charge test. The Trump administration, however, has argued the policy promotes self-sufficiency among immigrants.  \"That expectation in our law that legal immigrants who are going to stay here long-term can stand on their own two feet is a very long-standing not just tradition, but it\\'s a long-standing legal requirement,\" Ken Cuccinelli, the second-in-command at the Department of Homeland Security, told CBS News in a recent interview. \"I can cite family history in my Italian family about people who were sponsors and making sure their sponsorees had jobs and those kinds of things. That\\'s what we expect.\"', 'China’s Ambassador to Canada, Cong Peiwu, warned the country on Thursday that, if Ottawa cares about the “health and safety” of Canadians, it will not extend a hand to help Hong Kong refugees fleeing a wave of communist repression.  Leftist Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had warned China in remarks this week that Canada would not accept “coercive diplomacy” and that Ottawa would publicly condemn China for human rights abuses both in Hong Kong and in Xinjiang, a western province where evidence suggests the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has placed as many as 3 million people in concentration camps.  In Hong Kong, China unconstitutionally ended the region’s autonomy in May with a “national security” law that essentially outlawed criticism of the CCP there. CCP-controlled police have increasingly used the law to arrest pro-democracy dissidents for engaging in peaceful protests against China. At its peak, the anti-communist protests in the city attracted 2 million of Hong Kong’s 7 million people. Police have also hinted that they may use the law to prosecute hundreds of thousands of people for voting in pro-democracy party primaries this year.  Hong Kong’s Basic Law, its constitutional document, prohibits China from imposing any laws on it passed in Beijing. The current Hong Kong government has chosen to disregard this provision and enforce the “national security” law.  Cong, the ambassador to Ottawa, threatened Canadian citizens in remarks observing the anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries.  “We strongly urge the Canadian side not to grant so-called political asylum to those violent criminals in Hong Kong, because it is interference in China’s domestic affairs, and certainly it will embolden those violent criminals,” Cong said, referring to peaceful anti-communist protesters.  “If the Canadian side really cares about the stability and the prosperity in Hong Kong, and really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong and the large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong … you should support those efforts to fight violent crimes,” he added.  Despite Trudeau’s remarks, Canadian immigration services have yet to make a concrete declaration on the status of Hong Kong refugees. At least one couple did receive political asylum in Canada after fleeing Hong Kong; another 45 cases are reportedly pending.  On Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry declared Cong’s remarks “beyond reproach.”  “The Chinese embassy in Canada just made clear our just position on issues relating to Hong Kong. It is beyond reproach. If anyone is misinterpreting this, then you should ask for the reason and find out if there are ulterior motives involved,” spokesman Zhao Lijian, who spread a conspiracy theory that the U.S. Army is responsible for the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, told reporters.  Canadian officials responded with outrage to the threat (when asked, Cong did not deny that his remarks were a threat).  “The reported comments by the Chinese ambassador are totally unacceptable and disturbing,” Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne said in response. “I have instructed Global Affairs to call the Ambassador in to make clear in no uncertain terms that Canada will always stand up for human rights and the rights of Canadians around the world.”  Champagne is embroiled in an ongoing scandal, erupting in June when Canadian media reported that he possessed two outstanding mortgages with the Bank of China, a state company. The reports surfaced after Champagne issued praise and thanks to China for sending the country faulty medical equipment for use to fight the Chinese coronavirus.  Trudeau’s remarks on Tuesday against the Chinese government deviated significantly from his typical diplomacy. Like Cong’s, they were meant to mark the anniversary of Chinese-Canadian relations.  “We will remain absolutely committed to working with our allies to ensure that China’s approach of coercive diplomacy, its arbitrary detention of two Canadian citizens, alongside other citizens of other countries around the world, is not viewed as a successful tactic by them,” Trudeau said.  The prime minister was referring to the arbitrary arrests of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in China on dubious charges of “espionage.” The arrests closely followed Canada’s detention of Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. Meng is awaiting extradition to the United States over evidence that she actively violated sanctions on Iran. Chinese state media has been largely transparent about the true purpose of keeping Spavor and Kovrig behind bars, threatening Canada and urging it not to “sabotage” China.  Amnesty International has verified that the two Canadians have endured “obvious violations to their rights to a fair trial,” rendering the legal process illegitimate.  China’s Foreign Ministry responded tersely to Trudeau’s statements on Tuesday.  “We firmly deplore and oppose the Canadian side deliberately confusing right and wrong and once again making erroneous comments, and we have lodged stern representations,” spokesman Zhao Lijian said.  Zhao plainly stated that all tensions between China and Canada “are caused by Canada’s arbitrary detention of Meng Wanzhou, an innocent Chinese citizen who hasn’t breached any Canadian law.”  The spokesman then called Trudeau “hypocritical and weak” for condemning Chinese human rights atrocities.

Older Filipina American women — known as \"titas\" — made a splash in Nevada in get-out-the-vote moments during the campaign, from vibrant car parades to popular TikTok clips. They\\'re just one of a variety of Asian American and Pacific Islander groups that came out enthusiastically for Biden\\'s campaign even amid the stress and unusual circumstances of the coronavirus pandemic, said Christian Bato, the Biden campaign\\'s lead for AAPI outreach in Nevada.  With 98 percent of the expected vote reported, Biden had won just over 50 percent in Nevada to 47.5 percent for President Donald Trump. The difference was less than 37,000 votes.  According to Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote, or APIAVote, a nonpartisan civic engagement group, there were more than 209,000 eligible AAPI voters in Nevada going into the election, about 11 percent of the state\\'s electorate.  Asian Americans are the fastest-growing ethnic group in the U.S. And according to the 2010 census, it is in Nevada that their numbers have been increasing the fastest.  Exit polling indicated that 58 percent of Asian American voters in Nevada supported Biden and 40 percent chose Trump.  \"Even though Asian American voters can be a smaller segment of the electorate — which they usually are — when they show strong support for one candidate in a very close race, they could actually make the difference,\" said Jerry Vattamala, director of the Democracy Program for the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, or AALDEF. \"I think we saw that [in] Nevada and a few other states where [you had] these razor-thin margins.\"  Just under half the people questioned in AALDEF\\'s separate exit poll of early voters in Clark County, which includes the state\\'s AAPI center, Las Vegas, identified as Filipino American. Among those Filipino Americans, 56 percent supported Biden, while 44 percent backed Trump. Biden did better among those of self-identified Chinese descent, AALDEF found, winning 64 percent of the early vote to Trump\\'s 29 percent, and Biden was even more successful among people of Korean and Indian heritage.  Among first-time AAPIs who voted early in Clark County, 63 percent chose Biden and 37 percent chose Trump, Vattamala said. That compared to 53 percent for Biden and 42 percent for Trump among those who had voted in the past.  Overall, 51 percent of people in the AALDEF survey identified themselves as Democrats, 36 percent identified as Republicans, 11 percent said they were not members of any party, and 2 percent said they were members of some other party.  Notably, more than half the AAPI voters whom AALDEF surveyed during early voting said they were born in the U.S., and more than half said English was their native language. Vattamala said past surveys have shown that foreign-born voters and those who have limited proficiency in English — \"the very people [Trump] was trying to keep out of the country,\" as he put it — were more inclined to support Trump.  In Nevada, other data gathered by AALDEF suggest how AAPI voters — at least those who went to the polls early — may have been inclined to trend toward Biden.  For example, about 55 percent said they disapproved or strongly disapproved of the job Trump is doing as president, Vattamala said. Around 70 percent of those surveyed said they supported or strongly supported a woman\\'s right to an abortion as established by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade. Overwhelming majorities said they support laws protecting gay and transgender people from discrimination in housing and public accommodation and want to see comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship for the undocumented.  Bato, of the Biden campaign, said Asian American voters in the state were highly motivated \"given the circumstances of everything — Covid-19, President Trump\\'s rhetoric specifically targeting the Asian American community\" and the presence of Sen. Kamala Harris, who is of both Black and Indian descent, on the ticket. The campaign drew enthusiasm from a variety of groups even with the stress and the unusual circumstances of the pandemic, he said.  \"There was a lot of energy and momentum that we helped assist, but it really came from the community. They were very excited to have their voice heard, to reject some of that vitriol and the rhetoric that was targeted towards our community and to really uplift and elect the first Black, Asian American woman to hold the second-highest office in the land,\" he said.  \"They knew how important it was, but they wanted to have fun with it, especially during the pandemic time, and they were able to use that same sort of grit and hard work that they\\'ve had for decades of organizing this community and adapting to these times, [including] through digital media,\" he said.  It is often — and accurately — said, however, that AAPI voters are not a monolith.  In Nevada, observers say, Filipino Americans illustrate the complexity of — and the need for nuance in — voter outreach efforts. Vattamala said they have a high interest in and engagement with health care, including in occupations like nursing and hospital work, which may have put them on the front lines during the pandemic, in addition to the possibility of having experienced anti-AAPI racism associated with the virus. Among other things, the Filipino community is also noted for strong religious faith, particularly Catholicism.  Eric Jeng, deputy director of the grassroots nonprofit One APIA Nevada, said that based on polling and focus group conversations, his sense is that when AAPI voters consider political candidates, \"home-country politics do still play a big part\" that can vary by ethnic group.  Jeng said that in the Vietnamese and Taiwanese communities, for example, he gauged more enthusiasm for Trump based on their perceptions of his Asia policies. Simultaneously, however, \"the anti-AAPI racism that the president stoked\" motivated other Asian American voters to reject Trump, he said. The use of phrases like \"\\'kung flu\\' or \\'China virus\\' doesn\\'t help,\" he said.  While campaigns have made some strides in connecting with AAPI voters and enlisting people within communities to talk to their families, friends, neighbors and business colleagues, there\\'s still a lot to be done. Groups like APIAVote continue to report that large parts of the Asian American community, despite its rapid growth, have been left out of political outreach by both the Democratic and Republican parties for cycle after cycle.  Those working within the AAPI community to foster political engagement and influence have their own goals. \"I think one thing we want to shift from is kind of like the transactional electoral model to [asking] long term, \\'What does it mean to build power within the community?\\'\" Jeng said.  Vattamala also sounded a note of warning about looking at trends and reaching conclusions about AAPI voters in Nevada and nationally.  The pandemic presented considerable challenges to data collection in direct contact with voters, and millions ended up voting by mail and therefore were not interviewed by groups like AALDEF in the same numbers as in the past.  In addition, he said, exit polls could have been affected by variations by party in how likely people, including AAPIs, were to vote in person — either early or on Election Day — compared to voting by mail.  That having been said, Vattamala warned that some analysts could try to compare 2020 exit polls with exit polls from 2016 and conclude, \"Oh, it looks like Trump made a lot of inroads.\"  \"That seems to be the narrative now, [that] more people of color were starting to vote for Trump, support Trump, than in the past,\" he said. \"And I would just say I would take that with a grain of salt and be a little cautious.\"', 'In 2018, a reporter asked him if he felt he deserved it. “Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it,” he responded.  “I’m going to get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things — if they gave it out fairly, which they don’t,” Trump said in 2019.  “Nobel Peace, can you imagine?” he asked in September — the same month he retweeted at least 12 different messages from supporters on the topic.  AD  Trump’s unofficial, unorthodox quest for the prize has benefited from the help of far-flung foreign allies — including an anti-immigrant Norwegian politician and an Australian law professor best known for pro-monarchy campaigns — who ensure that he is nominated time and again.  AD  Even prominent world leaders, including South Korea’s Moon Jae-in, Britain’s Boris Johnson and former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, have found themselves dragged into the effort.  This year, the White House itself released an official statement to announce that Trump had been nominated for the 2021 prize. The World Food Program was awarded the 2020 prize on Friday.  So far, Trump’s campaign for recognition in Oslo has earned him plenty of headlines, but borne no other fruit.  AD  Nobel trackers argue that the campaign of Trump and his supporters is doing him no favors. “Trump is so despised outside the U.S. that I cannot imagine the committee will spend any time on him at all,” Fredrik Heffermehl, a Norwegian peace activist, wrote in an email Thursday.  The U.S. presidents who have won the prize — Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama — did not make similar lobbying statements or seek the prize publicly, historians say.  AD  Roosevelt’s nomination had been sponsored by “several American academics and several European diplomats for his efforts in mediating the end to the Russo-Japanese War,” said Stanley Wein, author of “Ambassador for Peace: How Theodore Roosevelt Won the Nobel Peace Prize.\"  Trump’s history of nominations  Unlike most other awards, the Nobel Peace Prize has a remarkably open system for nominations: Among the list of people who can nominate a person or group for a prize are university professors and national lawmakers. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was nominated in 1939.  AD  The Norwegian Nobel Committee say that there were 318 candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020, of which 211 are individuals and 107 are organizations. It is not clear whether Trump was nominated this year — the deadline for nominations was Jan. 31 and the committee keeps nominees’ names secret for 50 years.  AD  Trump’s initial entry into the nominations appears to have been unusual. Ahead of the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that the new U.S. president had been nominated twice, but the nominations were withdrawn after officials said they were fakes.  Trump was subsequently nominated multiple times for the prize in 2019 because of his negotiations with North Korea, according to public statements from those who nominated him. Among those who announced they had nominated him were Christian Tybring-Gjedde and Per-Willy Amundsen, two Norwegian lawmakers with the populist, anti-immigration Progress Party, and a group of 18 Republican lawmakers from the United States.  Not everyone who nominated Trump may have admitted it. In February 2019, Trump told reporters that Abe, then Japan’s prime minister, had given him “the most beautiful copy” of a letter nominating him for the prize. Abe, who sought a close relationship with Trump before retiring this year, never denied the account, instead telling lawmakers that he was “not saying it’s not true.”  AD  AD  Moon suggested Trump should win the Nobel for talks with North Korea, though it is not clear whether the South Korean president nominated him, while Johnson, the British prime minister, suggested in 2018 that Trump would deserve a prize if he makes peace with North Korea and Iran.  Although Trump did not win this year, there have been at least three nominations for him announced already for the 2021 prize. Tybring-Gjedde, who nominated Trump in 2018, wrote to Oslo in support of him again in September, citing the importance of a U.S.-brokered peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.  Well-known for anti-immigrant and anti-Islam views in Norway, Tybring-Gjedde had previously stoked controversy for comparing the hijabs worn by Muslim women to robes worn by Ku Klux Klan members.  AD  AD  Magnus Jacobsson, a member for the center-right Christian Democrats in Sweden’s parliament, later announced he had nominated Trump for the prize because of U.S.-led peace talks between Kosovo and Serbia.  A third nomination came shortly afterward from a group of Australian lawyers led by David Flint, an 82-year-old legal professor and monarchist campaigner whose eccentric comments have long earned him both fans and foes.  “What he has done with the Trump Doctrine is that he has decided he would no longer have America in endless wars, wars which achieve nothing but the killing of thousands of young Americans,” Flint told Sky News Australia.  An unlikely prize  Despite this praise, Trump-led negotiations in the Middle East and the Balkans have drawn some cautious reserve, with many arguing that they are small-scale and not the diplomatic breakthroughs Trump allies tout. North Korean talks have stalled since 2019, regardless of the hopes of a prize.  AD  AD  “If anything, peace on the Korean Peninsula is even more elusive today, given the specter of a nuclear-emboldened North Korea,” said Jean Lee, director of the Korean Center at the Wilson Center.  Trump’s poor international approval ratings further hinder his case. Although divisive figures have won the prize before — Wein noted that Roosevelt was a controversial pick in 1906, as he had a reputation as an “imperialist and lover of the glory of war” — Trump’s abrasive style is a clear disadvantage.  Heffermehl, the peace activist, has criticized the Norwegian Nobel Committee for not focusing on the original ethos of the prize, saying it should go to “champions of peace” who worked for a demilitarized “brotherhood of nations.\"  Though to that, he added, “I consider Trump grossly irrelevant.”', 'HOUSTON — The Trump administration is trying to deport several women who allege they were mistreated by a Georgia gynecologist at an immigration detention center, according to their lawyers.  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has already deported six former patients who complained about Dr. Mahendra Amin, who has been accused of operating on migrant women without their consent or performing procedures that were medically unnecessary and potentially endangered their ability to have children. At least seven others at the Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla, Georgia, who had made allegations against the doctor have received word that they could soon be removed from the country, the lawyers said.  Hours after one detained woman spoke to federal investigators, she said ICE told her that it had lifted a hold on her deportation and she faced “imminent” removal.  Another woman was taken to a rural Georgia airport early Monday and told to sign deportation papers, only to be brought back to the facility as her lawyers sued in federal court.  They allege Amin performed operations that caused or worsened their pain without explaining what he was doing or giving them an alternative. Their stories fit a broader pattern of allegations made by detained women against Amin, some of them revealed in interviews with attorneys and medical records reviewed by The Associated Press.  The Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation, and the Department of Homeland Security\\'s inspector general also is investigating.  Amin\\'s lawyer, Scott Grubman, has previously denied the doctor did anything wrong and called him a “highly respected physician who has dedicated his adult life to treating a high-risk, underserved population in rural Georgia.” Amin has stopped seeing women at Irwin County Detention Center.  Immigrant advocates have urged federal investigators to examine not just the doctor but also the detention center and any role ICE had in sending patients to him.  While people who have been deported might still be able to serve as witnesses in a criminal or civil case, many end up in unstable countries or situations where it becomes difficult to maintain contact with them. The deportations are occurring in the last weeks of President Donald Trump\\'s administration following his defeat by Democrat Joe Biden.  “ICE is destroying the evidence needed for this investigation,” said Elora Mukherjee, a Columbia University law professor who is working with several of the women.  ICE said it had notified the Homeland Security inspector general “about any planned transfers or removals of Irwin detainees who were former patients of Dr. Amin.”  “Any implication that ICE is attempting to impede the investigation by conducting removals of those being interviewed is completely false,” the agency said in a statement.  The Justice Department declined to comment. Grubman declined to say whether the doctor had spoken to investigators.  Mbeti Ndonga, 37, was taken to Amin last year after seeking treatment for abdominal pain and excessive vaginal bleeding. She said she wanted a new prescription to continue treatment ordered by a previous doctor. Instead, she said, Amin insisted she have a procedure known as dilation and curettage, in which tissue is removed from the uterus as a treatment for excessive bleeding. Her medical records show she was also given a laparoscopy, in which incisions are made in the abdomen.  “He was adamant and said I must have surgery,” Ndonga told AP.  When she awoke, she said Amin told her she would never be able to have children. It’s unclear whether that\\'s the case. She still suffers from bleeding and pain.  Ndonga has spoken twice to government investigators, most recently on Tuesday. “I told them that I was abused, tortured, dehumanized,” she said.  Within hours of her first interview last week, Ndonga and her lawyers say she was told ICE had lifted a hold on her deportation and she could be sent to Kenya at any time.  “Mbeti\\'s fear in answering the investigators’ questions were that it would make her immigration case worse,\" Mukherjee said. “And within hours of the interview, her worst fears were realized.”  Another woman was taken to see Amin in February after requesting estrogen patches to treat hot flashes, following a hysterectomy performed by another doctor in 2014. She asked to be identified only by her first name, Yanira, because she fears being targeted by criminals if deported to Mexico.  Yanira said Amin told her he would perform a vaginal ultrasound and that she would need a Pap smear, a test for cancer in which a doctor collects cells from a woman\\'s cervix.  Both procedures caused her intense pain. After the Pap smear, Yanira said she noticed there was no lubrication on the tools Amin had used. She had trouble sitting for nearly a week.  “We are humans. We are women. We have feelings,” she said. \"Just because we are detained doesn’t mean we should be treated like animals.”  ICE didn\\'t respond to questions about the two women, who were brought to the U.S. as young children. Ndonga was previously deported after being arrested for interference with government property, then apprehended by ICE after reentering the country, Mukherjee said.  Yanira entered immigration custody after being arrested for possession of less than a gram of cocaine or methamphetamine, criminal records show. Her attorneys notified the government Thursday that she wanted to talk to investigators about Amin. Early Monday, Yanira says she was driven to an airport to board a deportation flight. But another ICE agent approached to say she wouldn\\'t be deported because her lawyers had intervened.  Grubman declined to comment, citing federal privacy law.  ICE policy instructs agents to “exercise all appropriate discretion on a case-by-case basis” regarding the deportation of “victims of crime, witnesses to crime, and individuals pursuing legitimate civil rights complaints.”  The agency said this week that it was “accommodating the interviews” done by government investigators. It added that once a detained migrant has exhausted all appeals, “they remain subject to a final order of removal ... and that order must be carried out.\"', 'Thousands of Muslims throughout India took to the streets Friday to protest French President Emmanuel Macron’s refusal to criminalize cartoons, resulting in about 2,000 arrests in Madhya Pradesh alone.  The largest Madhya Pradesh protest occurred in the large city of Bhopal, and resulted in the arrest of lawmaker Arif Masood. Muslims in Mumbai also assembled in protest, lining the roads with photos of Macron’s face so that cars would have no choice but to run them over.  As Friday is traditionally the day of the week when Muslims attend prayers at their local mosques, many convened around the world after the prayers to protest the French. In Islamabad, the capital of neighboring Pakistan, thousands attempted to storm the French Embassy, prompting police to use tear gas to hold back the crowd.  The Islamic world — including, notably, governments and heads of state — has erupted with anti-French sentiment following the beheading of Samuel Paty, a French teacher, on October 16. A teen Chechen immigrant beheaded Paty after parents of Paty’s students organized to call for a fatwa on the teacher. Paty used cartoons of Muhammad taken from the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo to teach a class on freedom of expression.  Macron responded to the beheading by awarding Paty the Legion of Honor and declaring, “we will never give up our cartoons.” French police have shut down multiple mosques and arrested dozens of suspected jihadists, some for celebrating Paty’s death.  “One of our countrymen was assassinated because he was teaching, because he was teaching his students about the freedom of expression, the freedom to believe or not believe,” Macron said following the incident. “It’s not a coincidence if tonight a teacher was struck, because the terrorist wanted to attack the values of the public, its light, the possibility to make our children, no matter where they come from, no matter what they believe or not believe, no matter what their religion is, to make them free citizens.”  Islamic leaders like Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi all condemned Paris for failing to apologize for the cartoons or censor them. Notably, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been among the most supportive allies Macron has found around the world in the dispute.  According to the Press Trust of India (PTI), police arrested 2,000 people for violating Chinese coronavirus social distancing measures to participate in calls for boycotting French products. India’s News18 added that many demanded an apology from Macron for condemning radical Islamic terrorism. Masood, the lawmaker, was among the march’s leaders. He used his time to speak to “urge[…] the Central government to snap all financial ties with France.”  In Mumbai, the protests were reportedly more subdued than in Bhopal and largely consisted of plastering the streets with photos of Macron.  “Muslims in Mumbai pasted Macron’s photographs on roads. People, cars, dogs, cats are walking over the posters,” Maulana Abbas Rizvi, who participated in the event, told the Times of India. “He (Macron) had the audacity to under his government. He must be punished like this only. I congratulate Mumbai for punishing this wrongdoer like this.”  The protests across the border in Islamabad turned violent despite the nation being largely Islamist and the election a prime minister who supports global blasphemy laws enforced through the United Nations. While local reports suggest no major injuries, a crowd of about 3,000 men organized a failed effort to break through Islamabad’s red zone to reach the French embassy, demanding the expulsion of the nation’s ambassador. Many appeared on video attempting to climb over large shipping containers placed around the fortified area to keep mobs out; mob violence is not uncommon in Pakistan. Some hung Macron in effigy over a bridge.

The demonstrators staged sit-in at Aabpara Chowk and demanded the government to expel the French ambassador and boycott the products of the country, which is supporting the blasphemous caricatures at the state level,” Daily Pakistan reported.  As of Friday night, the mob responded to the tear gas by attacking police outposts and have stationed themselves in woodland near the barrier to the diplomatic zone and have reportedly declared they will stay overnight.  At least three other Pakistani cities — Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar — experienced anti-French protests on Friday.  Khan has responded to national outrage not by calling for a boycott of France, but claiming that he will lead a global effort to criminalize anything any Muslim may deem offensive anywhere in the world. In remarks on Friday, Khan said that Europeans were ignorant of the sensibilities of Muslims and that, as Muslims, it is “our responsibility to apprise them of the sentiments of Muslim community.”  Protests also reportedly occurred in Bangladesh, which already say a group of 40,000 people convene on Tuesday to call for a French boycott; Lebanon, where Macron has been instrumental in first response to August’s deadly explosion in the port of Beirut; Israel, where Palestinians called for a “day of rage;” and the United Kingdom.  Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.', 'When clashes between residents and police erupted onto the streets of Brixton in 1981, in the heart of London\\'s African-Caribbean community, the British press largely told one side of the story.  The Brixton riots , as they became known, were primarily depicted as a challenge to the rule of law. The press emphasized criminal elements, characterizingyoung, Black male protesters as \"troublemakers\" during those disturbances, according to studies cited in a subsequent analysis of how the UK media covered riots in 2011.  News reports at the time failed to account for the issues that were at the heart of the riots in 1981, including unemployment, racism and oppressive policing, in particular the extensive use of stop and search. That media bias was spotted by Val McCalla, who had arrived in England aged 15 some two decades earlier.  Jamaican-born McCalla was working at local London paper East End News when the Brixton clashes happened. He saw the need for a newspaper that would address the issues that mattered to British-born African-Caribbean people who were trying to stake their claim to the only country they had ever known.  With the help of a £62,000 ($81,000) loan from Barclays, McCalla launched The Voice in August 1982 at the Notting Hill Carnival, Europe\\'s biggest street party and a proud celebration of African-Caribbean culture. From an office in Hackney, east London, McCalla and then editor Flip Fraser led a team of young journalists covering hard news, investigations and human interest stories interspersed with sports, fashion and entertainment. The offices would later move to Brixton.  The Voice on November 2, 1985 with the news that American civil rights activist, Jesse Jackson would lead an anti-Apartheid rally in London.  \"It was very exciting,\" said Yvonne Thompson , who co-founded Black music radio station, Choice FM (now Capital Xtra) in 1990. The Voice was \"the place to look if you wanted to find out what was actually going on in the Black community,\" Thompson, who ran her own public relations firm for nearly three decades, told CNN Business.  Existing Black newspapers, such as The Caribbean Times, the West Indian Gazette and The Jamaica Gleaner , catered to mostly older immigrants who wanted to follow news from the Caribbean. The Voice, a weekly, tapped into a generation figuring out what it meant to be Black and British.  [The Voice] was the place to look if you wanted to find out what was actually going on in the Black community.\" Yvonne Thompson, business leader  While it may not hold the same sway it once did among Britain\\'s increasingly diverse Black community, its contribution to UK media is incontrovertible and its mission just as important today as it was 40 years ago.  A report by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism in 2016 found that just 6% of journalists in UK newsrooms are non-White, compared with about 13% of the general population. Earlier this year, the Institute published research showing that none of Britain\\'s top 10 print, digital or broadcast outlets have a Black editor in chief.  And a recent study by Women in Journalism, a campaigning organization, found that during one week in July not a single story by a Black reporter appeared on the front pages of the 11 most widely read UK newspapers.  The lack of diversity in UK newsrooms underscores how vital The Voice\\'s pioneering work has been, even if too little has changed elsewhere in the media since its inception.  Campaigning for justice  \"Without doubt it blazed a trail,\" said Joseph Harker , deputy opinion editor at The Guardian. The Voice \"spoke to that much younger, more energetic, angrier section of the population. It was the first Black newspaper aimed at Black British people,\" he added.  Harker joined the paper in 1987 straight out of university and spent four years there, first as a reporter and later as news and assistant editor. He was used to reading negative stories about Black people relating to crime, poverty and unemployment. Working at The Voice, where Black excellence was celebrated and where he was surrounded by Black ambition and success, had a profound impact on him.  \"It completely transformed my sense of what being Black means,\" Harker told CNN Business. The mainstream media had no interest in Black people \"apart from crime stories and riots,\" he added. \"If it was anything positive about Black people it just wouldn\\'t be covered.\"  The inaugural edition of The Voice newspaper, launched at the Notting Hill Carnival in August 1982.  From its founding, The Voice\\'s vision was that \"Britain\\'s fast-growing black community should have a voice amid all the social unrest erupting during the 1970s and early 1980s,\" the paper\\'s acting managing director George Ruddock wrote in an October 2019 editorial, announcing its move from weekly to monthly publication.  Its first issue (pictured above) led with a story about a Pakistani family in east London that was being targeted by a racist gang, marking what Ruddock considered to be \"the beginning of the publication\\'s long-standing reputation for campaigning on the many issues which affect the welfare of black Britain.\"  Nearly four decades later, The Voice continues to \"campaign, celebrate and educate,\" according to Paulette Simpson, executive director of The Voice Media Group. The newspaper changed hands in 2004, two years after McCalla died, and is now part of GV Media Group Limited.  The Windrush scandal , which erupted in 2017, remains one of its \"big campaigning issues,\" added Simpson. Windrush refers to the name of the ship that brought a generation of Caribbean immigrants to Britain in the late 1940s to help rebuild the country following World War II.  Subsequent changes to immigration laws wrongfully deprived many of them and their descendants of their rights to British citizenship. In some cases, they were deported. The UK government announced a compensation program for victims in 2018.  The Voice leads its front page on April 27, 1993 with the murder of Stephen Lawrence.  A lasting influence  The Voice continues to report on developments relating to Windrush and issues such as discriminatory policing, upholding a proud legacy of confronting injustice. The paper was writing about racism in the police years before an inquiry into the failed investigation of the murder of Stephen Lawrence concluded that \"pernicious and persistent institutional racism\" played a role.  Lawrence, a Black teen, was killed by a White gang while waiting for a bus on April 22, 1993. More than two decades after the inquiry into his killing , The Voice continues to cover the topic, leading its July issue with a story on systemic racism in policing, which is the subject of a probe by the Independent Office for Police Conduct.  Without doubt it blazed a trail. [The Voice] put Black journalism on the map.\" Joseph Harker, The Guardian  \"They report on the stories that no one else wants to tell... when it isn\\'t trendy or in the spotlight,\" said Tobi Oredein, the founder of Black Ballad , a digital lifestyle publication.  Oredein launched the publication while freelancing in 2014, after being repeatedly overlooked for roles at magazines that she said all went to White women.  Like McCalla three decades before her, Oredein was frustrated with the lack of media coverage of Black Britain. Beyond The Voice and hair magazines, there were no publications for Black women interested in their careers, finances and health, she told CNN Business.  Tobi Oredein, journalist and founder of Black Ballad.  At its peak of popularity, The Voice sold more than 50,000 copies a week, including in cities outside London such as Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol, where it still has loyal subscribers.  After 37 years as a weekly title, it decided to go monthly in September last year and revamped its website , which it said attracts more than 350,000 unique visitors and over 500,000 page impressions a month. A digital version of the newspaper reaches readers across the United Kingdom, as well as in Africa and the United States.  \"I think sadly it\\'s not as relevant now as it was in its heyday, in the early and mid 90s,\" said Harker of The Guardian. This is partly to do with the changing makeup of Britain\\'s Black population, with more immigrants from east and west Africa, and more racial integration than before, he added.  Still, many of the stories The Voice covers won\\'t be found elsewhere, which makes it a treasure trove of Black British history and brings a unique flavor to its content today.  For example, the September issue features a piece on the growing popularity of homeschooling among Black families and in August it explored the contribution that Black businesses make to the UK economy. As part of its celebration of Black History Month, the newspaper has profiled Gillian Joseph and Charlene White, anchors at Sky News and ITV News respectively.  The Voice\\'s October 2020 issue profiles anchors Gillian Joseph and Charlene White of Sky News and ITV News, respectively.  The Voice has itself launched the careers of several prominent journalists, including Martin Bashir, well known for his interviews with Princess Diana and Michael Jackson and now BBC religion editor; The Times Weekend editor Lesley Thomas; Guardian columnist Afua Hirsch; and writer and broadcaster Trevor Phillips.  The newspaper has also paved the way for other Black titles, such as Pride Magazine and, more recently, Black Ballad and gal-dem , which are garnering a growing following among young Black women who don\\'t see themselves represented in the pages of mainstream lifestyle publications.

Its influence in UK media \"will long outlast the publication itself.\"', 'Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the longest serving woman on the U.S. Supreme Court and a strong liberal voice on issues dividing the nation, has died, the Supreme Court said on Friday. She was 87.  \"Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died this evening surrounded by her family at her home in Washington, D.C., due to complications of metastatic pancreas cancer,\" the Court said in a statement.  Chief Justice John Roberts, a longtime friend of Ginsburg\\'s, called her a \"jurist of historic stature.\"  Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox  \"We at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague,\" Roberts said. \"Today we mourn, but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her — a tireless and resolute champion of justice.\"  Ginsburg revealed in July 2020 that she was undergoing chemotherapy for a recurrence of cancer. She had previously been treated for four bouts with cancer over the years, including a pancreatic tumor in 2019 and growths in her lung in 2018.  Her death leaves a vacancy on the Supreme Court that is sure to set off an intense partisan battle over her replacement, as a conservative Trump nominee could tip the balance in closely divided cases.  Ginsburg was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Bill Clinton in 1993. She was only the second woman in U.S. history elevated to the high court, after Sandra Day O\\'Connor, who was named by President Reagan in 1981.  Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1984. Terry Ashe/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images  She grew up in Brooklyn, New York, in the 1930s and 40s. She graduated from Cornell University and then in 1956, enrolled at Harvard Law School, where she was one of just nine women in a class of about 500. She juggled her studies with taking care of her first child.  When her husband, Martin Ginsburg, got a job at a New York law firm, they moved back to the city and she completed her degree at Columbia Law School. But despite graduating at the top of her class, the job market wasn\\'t welcoming.  \"There was not a single firm in the entire city of New York that would offer me a job,\" she recalled. She said she had three strikes against her: she was Jewish, a woman, and perhaps the ultimate deal-breaker, a mother.  \"Legal employers were afraid ... that I would be staying home more than I was showing up for work,\" she said.  Of course, she proved them wrong, building an impressive career as a law professor, founding director of the Women\\'s Rights Project of the ACLU, and federal judge.  Her work with the Women\\'s Rights Project in the 1970s had a far-reaching impact. She argued six landmark cases on gender equality before the U.S. Supreme Court, winning five of them to eliminate legal barriers that held women back in the workplace and civic life. She strategically advanced cases that would establish precedents for treating men and women equally under the law in such areas as jury duty requirements, Social Security and military spousal benefits, and even the legal drinking age.  \"She is to the women\\'s movement what former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall was to the movement for the rights of African-Americans,\" then-President Clinton said when he nominated her to fill the Supreme Court seat being vacated by retiring Justice Byron White.  \"I am proud to nominate this path-breaking attorney, advocate, and judge,\" he said, portraying her as a nonpartisan choice. \"Ruth Bader Ginsburg cannot be called a liberal or a conservative; she has proved herself too thoughtful for such labels.\"  Ginsburg won Senate confirmation by a vote of 96 to 3.  \"Her 27 years on the Court exceeded even my highest expectations when I appointed her,\" Mr. Clinton said in a statement following her death. \"Her landmark opinions advancing gender equality, marriage equality, the rights of people with disabilities, the rights of immigrants, and so many more moved us closer to \\'a more perfect union\\'.\"  She has described her approach to the law as cautious and measured, but over a quarter-century on the high court she assembled a track record of decisions placing her firmly in the court\\'s liberal wing. She supported abortion rights, marriage equality, the Affordable Care Act, and women seeking restitution for unequal pay.  Conservatives criticized her for straying too far from the Founding Fathers\\' original meaning of the Constitution. But when CBS News\\' Mike Wallace pointed out to her in a 2006 interview that the Constitution never mentioned abortion or same-sex marriage, she responded: \"Think back to 1787. Who were \\'we the people\\'? … They certainly weren\\'t women … they surely weren\\'t people held in human bondage. The genius of our Constitution is that over now more than 200 sometimes turbulent years that \\'we\\' has expanded and expanded.\"  Despite their very different ideological views, Ginsburg became close friends with the fiery conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016. They loved attending the opera together and even took to the stage as extras.  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg shares laugh with her husband Martin as they listen to Justice Stephen Breyer speak at Columbia Law School, Sept. 12, 2003. ED BAILEY/AP Photo  Ginsburg was treated for cancer multiple times — undergoing colon cancer surgery in 1999, an operation for early-stage pancreatic cancer in 2009, having tumors removed from her lung in 2018, radiation for a pancreatic tumor in 2019 and chemotherapy in the spring and summer of 2020. Yet she repeatedly insisted she had no intention of retiring as long as she could do the job \"full steam,\" and she rarely missed a day of work. To keep up her stamina she worked out with a personal trainer and became renowned for her notoriously tough fitness routine.  When her husband of 56 years, Martin Ginsburg, died in 2010, she was back on the bench the next day. She credited their long and happy marriage to a piece of advice she once received from her mother-in-law.  \"She said, \\'Dear, in every good marriage it helps sometimes to be a little deaf\\',\" Ginsburg said. \"And I followed that advice in dealing not only with my dear spouse but in dealing even with my colleagues on the U.S. Supreme Court.\"  Ginsburg achieved an unexpected measure of pop culture stardom in her later years, when a blog and online memes celebrating the soft-spoken, elderly Justice as the \"Notorious R.B.G.\" went viral, leading to a best-selling biography by the same name.  The American flag flies at half staff outside the U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C. following the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on September 18, 2020. ALEXANDER DRAGO / REUTERS  One of the book\\'s authors, Irin Carmon, told Rolling Stone in 2017, \"When people ask us, \\'Why are young women inspired by RBG?\\' to us it\\'s such an obvious question that it\\'s hard to answer. We live in a society that most of the time really stigmatizes ideals of gender equality and feminism, and there\\'s this woman who has for decades been using her power in the highest court of the land for good. That\\'s a really big deal.\"  A documentary film, \"RBG,\" and a Hollywood dramatization of her story, \"On the Basis of Sex,\" helped cement Ginsburg\\'s image as a crusader in the popular imagination.  Ginsburg herself expressed a more modest view of a Supreme Court justice\\'s role: \"Judges are something like firefighters. They don\\'t make the fires, but they do their best to put them out.\"', 'Actress and leftist activist Amy Schumer posted a staged photo of mannequin dolls in cages in a social media rant urging people to vote against America’s “caste system.” Schumer’s screed to her 10 million-plus Instagram followers includes a link to a Democratic National Committee (DNC) voter registration website.  “I’m voting for the marginalized people who are victims of the caste system we live in,” Schumer captioned her post, with the hashtag “#ImVotingFor” and a link to the DNC’s website that registers voters.  The image of individual cages with mannequin dolls sitting in each is a staged installation from February that was erected by the open borders group Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES).  The cages filled with dolls were put up in Des Moines, Iowa, near caucus voting cites “meant to represent migrant children who have been detained at the US-Mexico border and other centers in the United States,” according to a local report. Images of the dolls and cages come up in a quick Google search of “kids in cages,” a repeated Democrat talking point through the last three years of President Trump’s administration.  Watch below:  In 2018, the Trump administration enforced its zero-tolerance policy to stop the flow of illegal adult border crossers from arriving at the country with minor children.  The separation of adult border crossers from the children they arrive with, though, has occurred since before 2001, court records have shown, and the Obama administration used the same detention centers that are currently being used.  Detaining child border crossers was a policy during the Obama administration, where Breitbart Texas exclusively reported on the conditions in which unaccompanied minors were being packed into crowded cells and holding facilities.  As for Schumer, this is but her latest attempt to boost voter turnout ahead of the November election. Last month, the Trainwreck star teamed up with Seinfeld writer and actor Larry David for a primetime ABC election special, called VOMO: Vote or Miss Out, that also featured Michelle Obama and her voter registration group, When We All Vote.

As proof, Ingraham cited a member of Biden\\'s COVID-19 advisory board, University of Minnesota epidemiologist Dr. Michael Osterholm.  \"We could lock down for four to six weeks, and if we did that, we could drive the numbers down,\" Osterholm told Yahoo Finance. \"Then we could really watch ourselves cruising into the vaccine availability [period] in the first and second quarter of next year, and bringing back the economy long before that.\"  Ingraham argued that such a policy would be \"no big deal to the people like Osterholm and the elites in charge, because they are always going to have jobs.  \"But for the millions of others, businesses will close, jobs will be lost, schools will remain closed, depression and suicide numbers will go up, and other illnesses will be left untreated and undetected.\"  As another example, Ingraham cited German engineer Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, who wrote in June about the need \"to create a healthier, more equitable and more prosperous future.\"  \"Fairer outcomes by coordination in tax regulatory, trade, and fiscal policy. It all may include changes to wealth taxes; the withdrawal of fossil fuel subsidies; and new rules governing influential intellectual property, trade, and competition; and transitioning from fossil fuels to green energy,\" Ingraham said.  \"Does that sound familiar? It is basically Biden\\'s agenda. When Biden said we\\'re going to work with our allies, what he really means is he\\'s going to let them have veto power over our trade initiatives, our patent and trademark laws, and our energy industry - and that\\'s just a start,\" she said.  This weekend, Ingraham noted, Biden is at his Delaware beach house, likely working with his advisers on the goals of this \"reset.\"  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  \"As he plans to tighten the screws on Americans with higher taxes, more restrictions, and Lord knows what else, he plans to open up the country ... to a mass influx of illegal aliens. Refugees. H-1B workers, they are going to have an open society, open door, come on in. The rest of us? Not so much,\" she said.  \"Because that is how we are going to get to a world that is fairer and more equitable. Unfortunately, it\\'s going to require you to work harder for less. Less money, and less freedom. And now what\\'s more frightening: Getting COVID, or living in that America?\"', 'President Donald Trump is on track to raise his share of Asian American voters to perhaps 35 percent in 2020, up from perhaps 27 percent in 2016.  Asian Americans are just five percent of the nation’s voters, and most are concentrated in blue states along the coasts. But every slice of voters is vital in an election that may be decided by just a few tens of thousands of voters in North Carolina, Nevada, Georgia, and other states.  A September 15 poll of 1,569 voters showed Trump’s support at 30 percent, with 15 percent saying “don’t know.”  But he scored 37 percent support in swing states outside New York and California. Also, 37 percent of Asian voters said they have a “very favorable” or “somewhat favorable” view of Trump, compared to a 53 percent positive response to Joe Biden.  The September poll also showed that GOP candidates have 34 percent support from Asian voters, plus some share of the 18 percent who said they had not picked a candidate.  The poll comes as other data shows how identity-politics Democrats underestimated the popularity of Trump’s populist policies among Latinos.  In the Asian poll, Trump’s support was strongest among Vietnamese Americans, at 48 percent, and weakest among Chinese Americans, at just 20 percent.  Indian American voters offered Trump just 28 percent support, with only six percent undecided despite Trump’s repeated support for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  A major issue for Indian American voters is the campaign by Fortune 500 companies to provide fast-track green cards to the hundreds of thousands of Indians who are being imported for white-collar jobs via the H-1B, J-1, OPT, and L-1 worker pipelines. The Senate bill offering more green cards, S.386, has been blocked by GOP senators. The unpopular bill was blocked because it would dramatically help Fortune 500 CEOs dangle offers of green cards to recruit many more Indians for Americans’ white-collar jobs.  Trump is getting support from some Indian American voters, including Indian Voices for Trump. The Indian Voices group has eclipsed the Republican Hindu Coalition, which supported Trump in 2016.  The Indian Voices group is run by Al Mason, a real estate investor. The co-chair is Mrinalini Kumari.  Trump Power: 50% + Indian American Democrats In Each of The Battle Ground State Are Crossing Over To ReElect President @realDonaldTrump Come Nov 3rd 2020 🇾 pic.twitter.com/LVRB2CBwR7 — Al Mason (@opinionbazaar) June 25, 2020  However, Trump’s base consists of Americans who worry about losing their jobs and communities to imported workers. The base delivered him into the White House in 2016, leaving him little room to woo the subset of Asian immigrant voters who want more immigration and more diversity.  For 2020, Trump is offering “pro-American immigration” policies plus deregulation for business.  In contrast, Biden is offering a combination of Wall Street’s cheap-labor policies and progressives’ support for large-scale migration and diversity. Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris, is the daughter of an Indian immigrant.  But Trump may not need migration concessions to win votes from Asian American voters, just as he does not need to offer amnesty to win large slices of the Latino vote. These nonwhite voters have a variety of normal reasons to oppose the Democrats’ corrosive policies on the economy, university admissions, policing, foreign policy, and cultural issues such as racial claims and transgender promotion.  For example, the Times of India reported September 18 on the administration’s outreach to Indian American voters, which emphasized national security rather than free movement of Indian workers:  At the formal launch event of Indian Voices for Trump, Eric [Trump] referred to his father’s foreign policy on China and Pakistan, which he said “is very different from his predecessors.” “I think that’s very different than past presidents, to tell you the truth. I think when you see how past presidents have emboldened China. And you see the problems that Indians are having with China and will likely have with China and in fact the whole world will probably have with China at some point. You know the problems with Pakistan better than I ever will,” he said. … In his welcome address, Indian Voices for Trump board member Ritesh Desai thanked President Trump and his family for supporting Indian-Americans and strengthening U.S.-India ties.  India and the United States are natural allies, Desai said at the September 17 meeting in Georgia.  The September survey was run by Asian Americans Advancing Justice, APIAVote, and AAPI Data. The New York Times downplayed Trump’s gains as it reported Setempber 15:  “Through this survey, we see that Asian-Americans are ready to exercise their power,” said John C. Yang, the head of Asian Americans Advancing Justice – AAJC, an advocacy group that co-sponsored the survey.  In contrast, the data about Trump’s claimed 27 percent score in 2016 came from a small-scale exit poll, NPR reported. The 2017 data came from a much larger survey by the Democrat-leaning Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF):  The difference in the [two survey’] results lies, in large part, because of how the polling was conducted. AALDEF surveyed close to 14,000 Asian-American voters, more than 14 times the number of Asian-American participants in Edison Research’s [exit] poll. While Edison Research conducted polling in English and Spanish, AALDEF used questionnaires written in English and 11 Asian languages including Chinese, Bengali, Korean, Tagalog, and Vietnamese, plus volunteers who could speak 23 Asian languages and dialects.  Both the 2020 AAJC poll and the 2017 AALDEF poll show that Trump’s vote share was very different in the various groups of Asian immigrants.  Some of the groups are antagonistic to each other, and they have different priorities over trade, integration, economics, migration, and national security.  For example, Trump got 24 percent of Chinese American votes in 2016, says AALDEF. Trump now gets 20 percent support in the AAJC’s 2020 survey, plus some share of the 23 percent “don’t know” responses in the AAJC survey.  In contrast, Trump got 14 percent of Indians’ vote in 2016 and may reach 28 percent in 2020, according to the two surveys.  In 2016, Trump got just nine percent of Arab American votes, 14 percent of Korean American votes, 27 percent of Filipino American votes, and 32 percent of Vietnamese American votes, according to the 2017 survey.  The AAJC’s 2020 poll showed Trump’s declared support was higher outside blue-state New York and California.']\n"

      "“I'm running because I think everybody deserves universal health care and guaranteed housing,” Scarane told Mary Matthews, 57. “We need a $15 minimum wage.”  AD  “At least!” Matthews said. “Just let me be able to find you after voting, though. That's the problem.” Then the twist: “Coons ain't that way. I remember when he started in politics, and I used to live on 9th and Franklin, and I'd see him.”  AD  Matthews took a handout and sounded open to supporting Scarane. The year's final battle between the Democratic Party's left and center is unfolding today in a state that has been hostile to the Trump-era GOP, emboldening activists who want “corporate” members of Congress replaced. It's also a place where incumbents can shake every primary voter's hand — and usually do, when the country isn't in the grip of a pandemic.  “In the middle of a campaign I literally meet thousands and thousands of people,” Coons said in an interview this weekend, after stopping by the city's waterfront for an event recognizing Delaware's Hispanic businesses. “On a typical Fourth of July, we'd go to five parades, where I'd shake thousands of hands. Epidemiologically, that's a really bad idea right now.”  AD  Scarane, a digital strategist who's raised more than $300,000, is trying to build on the left's four-year project of changing the Democratic Party, in a place where the movement is playing catch-up. Two years ago, activist and veteran Kerri Evelyn Harris challenged Sen. Thomas R. Carper, who had been running successful races statewide since 1976. She got 35 percent of the vote after spending less than $200,000, revealing that there was a base for left-wing politics in a state politically dominated by moderate suburbanites.  AD  “There's people who may have voted in that race had Kerri gained traction earlier, which is one reason we started earlier,” said Scarane, who announced her bid last November. “There's definitely been a shift in favor of things like Medicare-for-all and a Green New Deal among Democrats in this state.”  The nomination of Joe Biden, who endorsed Coons and appears on his literature, revealed the intraparty limits of that agenda. (“I like Coons the best,” Biden told reporters Monday after casting an early vote.) The left saw 2018 as a building year in Delaware, finding potential voters and linking together volunteers who could at the very least win lower-turnout elections down the ballot.  AD  The Coons-Scarane race has not attracted the same national investments as the Carper-Harris race, when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigned in Wilmington and Justice Democrats lent staff and money for the primary challenge. Both have ignored this race, viewing others as more winnable, with the New York-based Working Families Party providing the biggest out-of-state muscle for Scarane. But the campaign itself claims to have tapped 1,200 volunteers, knocked 40,000 doors and made 900,000 calls using the Democratic voter file, while WFP has run digital ads against Coons as part of down-ballot investments in Delaware.  AD  “Progressive donors, who used to support national Democrats but weren't as active at the local level, have been activated,” said WFP's Mid-Atlantic political director Vanessa Clifford, who co-managed the 2018 Harris campaign. “There weren't many serious challengers before Kerri's run two years ago.”  Scarane's case against Coons is simple, even if it takes some explaining at the doors. Elected in 2010, Coons has voted reliably with Democrats on their major priorities but prioritized bipartisan work while rejecting the agenda associated with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Like other Justice Democrats, Scarane puts the blame on corporate PAC money — she refuses it — and argues that Coons would impede the party's agenda if it took back power. Like Harris, she's tried to make the race a referendum on the “Delaware Way,” in which business-friendly candidates trade their seats but never enact a liberal agenda.  AD  “There are certain people who've bought into the line that bipartisanship is important, and we need a Congress that gets along,” Scarane said in an interview at her Wilmington home. “But there are other people who see the senator as quick to run to the other side instead of standing with us on the things Democrats should be fighting for.”  AD  Coons was not around for the votes that became vulnerabilities for Carper, like the 2002 authorization of war in Iraq. Scarane has focused instead on his support for Senate supermajority rules and questioned his commitment to supporting liberal judges. For evidence, she cites both his reluctance to end the filibuster and his 2013 vote against Debo Adegbile, an attorney nominated by President Barack Obama to help lead the civil rights division of the Justice Department.  Both questions, at the root, ask whether Coons would undermine a post-election liberal agenda. On the filibuster, Coons said he would see where events took the Senate, if Democrats took control and were trying to pass a Biden administration's agenda. Step one was trying to form consensus, and step two was tbd.  AD  “If Minority Leader McConnell — doesn't that sound good? — uses the filibuster to block progress on any sort of legislative progress, then I'm not going to stand by and watch,” Coons said, citing immigration and gun safety as legislative priorities with Republican support. “I got to the Senate in 2011, and I'm not willing to see repeats of what he did to Obama, when we got nothing done for years.”  AD  The Adegbile issue was trickier. When Democrats held the Senate, Coons joined every Republican and six other Democrats to block the Obama nominee. Adegbile had argued in a brief that Mumia Abu-Jamal, a death-row inmate convicted of killing a police officer, had been victimized by racially biased jury selection. The Fraternal Order of Police opposed Adegbile, and so did Coons. Reflecting on it now, Coons said, he should have worked harder to get to yes, but he said he was unable to square Adegbile's record with his feelings over the killing of the officer.  “In the run-up to the vote, I had asked Debo if he would call the widow of Dan Faulkner and express some regret about how the whole issue had ended up. And he would not. And I may have overreacted to that. I've had long conversations with the civil rights community here to say that I recognize that he would have been a great assistant attorney general for civil rights.”  AD  Unlike Carper, Coons will end the primary without debating his opponent, depriving Scarane of the chance to confront him directly on his votes. But like many other incumbents facing challengers this year, Coons emphasized his liberal bona fides, pitching himself as a Biden ally who could get things done, and he's kept nearly every elected official in the party on his side. Bryan Townsend, a liberal state senator who won his seat by ousting the more moderate Democratic incumbent, argued that Coons's strong reputation with Republican senators positioned him perfectly to be a liberal dealmaker in a Biden-run Washington.  AD  “Whatever his portfolio positions are, they come along with a tremendously hard work ethic and an ability to articulate the issues in a way that appeals to a broad number of people,” Townsend said. “There's a lot to be said for electing someone who is going to be able to hold the institution together from both sides, and make progress. I think in some ways he is taking undue heat for the idea that he isn't ‘progressive’ on this or that issue or sufficiently progressive, because he's focused on trying to figure out what can get done, as quickly as possible.”  While broadcasting confidence about the race, Coons has spent $4 million on his campaign, most of it on resources that can be turned around for the seven-week general election but much of it to beat Scarane. Two years ago, the left badly underestimated what it would take to beat Carper, as a surge of suburban turnout overwhelmed Harris's 29,406 votes — thousands more than her campaign thought she needed. More than 100,000 Delawareans had requested mail ballots by the end of Monday, and both Scarane and Coons were expecting high turnout.  AD  They were seeking their final votes in very different ways. On Saturday, Coons visited some outdoor parks where his campaign had rented space for socially distant canvassing and phone-banking. He marveled at Mack McKay, a 79-year-old supporter from his church, who had made tens of thousands of calls, and he gave one caller some advice for her voter conversations: She could mention that he was one of very few Democrats who supported a commission to study reparations.  AD  On Friday, Scarane and her supporters were at the doors, having conversations that ranged from polite to promising. Voters had nothing negative to say about Coons, and some had recollections about meeting him. Scarane kept the pitch to the agenda she'd take to Washington, always starting by saying the system was “working great for the very wealthy” and seeing where the voter took it.  “It sounds like you've got some good ideas, and we need new blood in there,” said Randi Williams, a 59-year-old lab technician. With a Senate candidate on her doorstep, Williams turned to her chief electoral concern: How would Democrats defeat Donald Trump?

Dems in disarray.  “Trump’s first indoor rally in months staged as a rebuke to coronavirus restrictions,” by Anne Gearan and Josh Dawsey  The meaning of a crowded room in Nevada.  How can a mighty field program work with voters stuck at home?  In the states  The very, very long primary season, which started in Texas six months ago, comes to an end today in Delaware.  Mostly.  Let's be sticklers. In Louisiana and Georgia, all-party primaries will be held Nov. 3 — for every major office in the former, and for the seat held by Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) in the latter. But today's contests in Delaware close the chapter on partisan primaries, and when the votes are in, nearly every two-party matchup in 49 states will be set.  Most attention will gravitate to the Coons-Scarane primary, by far the costliest race on the ballot. It's not a rematch, as Coons has never faced a well-funded challenger and Scarane has never run for office before. But in some ways, it's round two of the left's Delaware project, an effort to create a beachhead in a place that has moved away from Republicans during Donald Trump's presidency.  That project began in 2018 with Kerri Evelyn Harris's campaign, and the vote patterns today will reveal whether the left can make more gains with suburbanites. Harris did best in vote-rich New Castle County, winning 37 percent of the vote there, and ran strongest near Newark, home to the University of Delaware. She did worst in the outlying suburbs that vote Republican in general elections and worse still in Delaware's more rural counties, Kent and Sussex. Coons starts out as a heavy favorite in all three counties, and the high number of absentee ballot request and early votes — factors not there in 2018 — suggest a high-turnout election.  After 2018, Delaware Republicans were locked out of power in the state, a punctuation mark on a long decline. They have not won the state's sole seat in the House of Representatives since 2008, they have not won a Senate election since 1994, and they have been locked out of the governor's office since 1988. The party's recruitment this year doesn't point to much optimism about reversing the decline, especially with a well-liked Joe Biden leading the Democratic ticket.  Still, Republicans will field candidates for every major office on the ballot this year. The state GOP has endorsed attorney Julianne Murray for governor, but she's facing five opponents, including state Sen. Colin Bonini, who ran and lost to Democratic Gov. John Carney by 19 points in 2016. Republicans have also endorsed veteran Jim DeMartino and actor Lee Murphy, respectively, to take on the winner of the Democrats' Senate primary and two-term Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester.  Primary upsets are possible in each race. DeMartino has been heavily outspent by Lauren Witzke, a pro-Trump activist who’s tweeted the slogan (“WWG1WGA”) of the QAnon conspiracy theory movement and has been adept at getting attention despite the steep odds against her. Though not endorsed by Trump, Witzke tweeted at the president and his son Donald Trump Jr. on Monday, claiming that a child had been egged “by hateful leftists” at one of her campaign events. The president’s son retweeted it.  Murphy has raised less than $60,000 for his race, less than Witzke, but far more than his challenger, Matthew Morris. Still, Morris has gotten some attention by pitching himself as “the great American comeback story” — beating an opioid addiction to turn his life around.  Further down the ballot, the left is watching some local primaries closely, to see if they can repeat the breakthroughs they've been pulling off in other state races for city and legislative offices. The Working Families Party, which has endorsed Scarane, is backing two candidates for Wilmington's city council, Colby Owens and Shané Darby. It's also supporting four candidates in state legislative seats that are likely to go Democratic in November: Madinah Wilson-Anton, Larry Lambert, Marie Pinkney and Eric Morrison. If victorious, Pinkney could become the first Black gay woman in the state legislature; Sarah McBride, a transgender activist running for a safe state Senate seat in Wilmington, could become the state's first trans legislator if she wins today's primary.

Coons is that he's too beholden to campaign donors, especially corporate PACs. One of those business interests has been running ads to boost Coons, asking (as all such ads must ask, to conform to campaign law) voters to “call Chris Coons today and tell him thanks” for backing a stimulus and changes to the supply chain.  Donald Trump, “Joe Biden Has Done Absolutely NOTHING for America in 47 Years!” The latest spot from the president's campaign hands the microphone to a woman, never named, who says confidently that Joe Biden could “never handle the economy after covid.” Like many Trump ads, however, it focuses mostly on the economy before the pandemic, citing a headline about “women and minorities return[ing] to the workforce” that ran in The Washington Post 18 months ago.  Restoration PAC, “Just Begun.” A super PAC funded almost entirely by Illinois megadonor Richard Uihlein, Restoration has run a string of ads in the Midwest supporting local Republican candidates and making very different arguments against Joe Biden. One ad, running 120 seconds long, reintroduced voters to the plagiarism controversy that sunk Biden's 1988 presidential bid. This one only features Biden in a montage of Democrats who “hate” and “spied on” Trump to encourage the president's base that nothing can stop him. “They hate him because he's unraveling their schemes and draining the swamp, and they despise all those who support his efforts,” a narrator says.  You are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox.    Poll watch  If Joe Biden was president, would he have handled the summer's unrest better or worse? (Monmouth, 867 adults)  Better: 45% Worse: 28% Same: 23%  The Trump campaign's “law and order” focus and some decline in the number of coronavirus cases have succeeded in raising the salience of a topic Trump prefers. The problem, here and in other polls, is that it's not a clear winner for the president; it's just less rocky for him than the covid-19 response. By a 37-point margin, down from a 42-margin in June, voters say that Trump's response to protests has made the national situation worse; by a 17-point margin, more voters think Biden would have done a better job handling the protests. Democrats live in fear of another protest developing into a violent riot, but nothing so far has advanced the Trump message that unrest now is a preview of “Joe Biden's America.”  Which candidate has the sharpness and stamina to be president? (CNN/SSRS, 787 likely North Carolina voters)  Donald Trump: 50% Joe Biden: 44%  New state polls have produced mostly good news for Biden; he's ahead in every state carried by Hillary Clinton, and in every state Trump won last time by two points or less, the president is trailing. The green shoots are in CNN's question about “sharpness,” a question that has been central to Trump's campaigning even as the message of the week has changed. In both this poll and CNN's poll of Wisconsin, Biden is leading overall and tied or better with Trump when asked who could best tackle crime. The only “issue” lead for the president comes when voters are asked about the candidate's energy and mental strength. That could raise the salience of Biden's Thursday town hall on the network and will definitely raise the stakes in the Sept. 29 debate: The perception of a slow and stumbling Biden is one thing keeping the president in the hunt.  Presidential election in Florida (Monmouth, 428 registered voters)  Joe Biden: 50% Donald Trump: 45%  Last week's Florida polling spurred a Democratic panic over the Latino vote, a source of strength for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign that, per NBC/Marist, had moved back to the GOP. Biden's campaign had not taken all the freelance advice offered by Latino strategists — Chuck Rocha, who helped Bernie Sanders win the Latino vote in the primaries, was among the critics — but it had been running Spanish-language ads for months, sparking fresh liberal worries that nothing was working for him. Monmouth's poll finds a very different Florida electorate, almost identical to the 2016 exit polls, which had Clinton winning the state's Latinos by 27 points. The Latino electorate has changed since then, with tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans settling in the state, and Democratic worries are less about converting conservative Cuban American voters than about preventing what happened in 2018: Republicans out-organizing them against the newest Latino voters, erasing Democratic gains elsewhere. Without a shift back, Biden’s resilience with older White voters gives him a lead.  Voting wars  Third-party candidates lost a string of legal challenges over the past week, encouraging Democrats who saw them as threats to winning some key states — something Republicans didn't really dispute, as they helped the challengers.  In Wisconsin, the Green Party lost its ballot access, after the state Supreme Court affirmed that Greens botched their paperwork, failing to update the home address of vice-presidential nominee Angela Walker. That led to hundreds of petition signatures getting tossed, pushing the Greens off the state's ballot for the first time in the national party's history, but the court deemed it necessary to avoid complicating the sending of absentee ballots, which will begin this week. The Greens dawdled in filing their challenge, during which time county clerks began putting the ballots together.  “Even if we would ultimately determine that the petitioners’ claims are meritorious, given their delay in asserting their rights, we would be unable to provide meaningful relief without completely upsetting the election,” wrote the court's majority, with one conservative joining the court's three liberals. “We agree with the [Election] Commission that requiring municipalities to print and send a second round of ballots to voters who already received, and potentially already returned, their first ballot would result in confusion and disarray and would undermine confidence in the general election results.”  The court may still hear a challenge from Kanye West, who was removed from the ballot after evidence showed that the Republican attorney who delivered his paperwork filed it after the deadline. But the rationale provided by the court yesterday suggests that West won't get a pass: Adding his name would force hundreds of thousands of printed ballots to be destroyed or rely on voters who receive them to send them back unused.  Greens have also been tossed from the Montana ballot, where Democrats saw their Senate candidate as a threat to Gov. Steve Bullock, and the Rhode Island ballot, where there's little at stake but the party filed too few petition signatures. They are still on Pennsylvania's ballot, but Democrats have appealed a lower court's decision to the state Supreme Court, where their party has elected a majority of the justices. The situation there is the reverse of the story in Wisconsin: Democrats represent the last impediment to the state sending out its historic number of absentee ballots.  The Greens' presidential nominee, Howie Hawkins, has continued to campaign despite the ballot challenges. West, who has made only fitful campaign statements since declaring his bid 10 weeks ago, has said nothing about the lawsuits, delegating that work to attorneys. Unless he gets a respite from another court, the rapper will appear on just 12 ballots, three of them in states where he needed only to pay a fee for access. He'll have been removed from nine state ballots that he applied for, with the reasons ranging from insufficient signatures to, in Arizona, his decision to register as a Republican in his adopted home state of Wyoming, voiding his attempt to appear on the ballot as an independent. Just two states where West made the ballot, Iowa and Minnesota, are being contested by both Trump and Biden.  Candidate tracker  One of the last weeks before the presidential debates began with a fight over climate change, and continued today with something Democrats aren't actually fighting at all: the Trump administration-brokered “Abraham Accords,” under which two Arab nations that were not at war with Israel formalized their peaceful relations.  “We’re here this afternoon to change the course of history,” Donald Trump said at a White House signing ceremony Tuesday afternoon. “After decades of division and conflict, we mark the dawn of a new Middle East.” Joe Biden's campaign has talked little about the accords since initially congratulating the administration for them; the Trump campaign has focused less on the specifics of the accords than on a Norwegian politician nominating the president for a Nobel Peace Prize.  The day before, Trump visited California for a roundtable on the state's response to forest fires while Biden, in Delaware, delivered a speech warning that a second Trump term would lead to policies that make climate change worse. Democrats seized on an exchange between the president and Wade Crowfoot, California's secretary for natural resources.  “If we ignore that science and sort of put our head in the sand and think it’s all about vegetation management, we’re not going to succeed together protecting Californians,” Crowfoot said.  “Okay,” Trump said. “It’ll start getting cooler. You just watch.”  “I wish science agreed with you,” Crowfoot said.  “Well, I don’t think science knows, actually,” Trump said. The next morning, in a long interview with “Fox and Friends,” the president suggested that the lack of forest fires in wetter climates, like Austria's, suggested that climate change was not making fires any worse.  Kamala D. Harris returned to California on Tuesday to survey the damage; Mike Pence campaigned in Wisconsin on Monday. Meanwhile, House Republicans released their “Commitment to America,” a brief but targeted list of policy goals they'll act on if they win. It includes a Marshall Plan for Main Street ($200 billion of small-business loans), a five-year plan for universal broadband access, support for school choice, and a vague promise to shore up Medicare and Social Security.

      "“I'm running because I think everybody deserves universal health care and guaranteed housing,” Scarane told Mary Matthews, 57. “We need a $15 minimum wage.”  “At least!” Matthews said. “Just let me be able to find you after voting, though. That's the problem.” Then the twist: “Coons ain't that way. I remember when he started in politics, and I used to live on 9th and Franklin, and I'd see him.”  Matthews took a handout and sounded open to supporting Scarane. The year's final battle between the Democratic Party's left and center is unfolding today in a state that has been hostile to the Trump-era GOP, emboldening activists who want “corporate” members of Congress replaced. It's also a place where incumbents can shake every primary voter's hand — and usually do, when the country isn't in the grip of a pandemic.  “In the middle of a campaign I literally meet thousands and thousands of people,” Coons said in an interview this weekend, after stopping by the city's waterfront for an event recognizing Delaware's Hispanic businesses. “On a typical Fourth of July, we'd go to five parades, where I'd shake thousands of hands. Epidemiologically, that's a really bad idea right now.”  Scarane, a digital strategist who's raised more than $300,000, is trying to build on the left's four-year project of changing the Democratic Party, in a place where the movement is playing catch-up. Two years ago, activist and veteran Kerri Evelyn Harris challenged Sen. Thomas R. Carper, who had been running successful races statewide since 1976. She got 35 percent of the vote after spending less than $200,000, revealing that there was a base for left-wing politics in a state politically dominated by moderate suburbanites.  “There's people who may have voted in that race had Kerri gained traction earlier, which is one reason we started earlier,” said Scarane, who announced her bid last November. “There's definitely been a shift in favor of things like Medicare-for-all and a Green New Deal among Democrats in this state.”  The nomination of Joe Biden, who endorsed Coons and appears on his literature, revealed the intraparty limits of that agenda. (“I like Coons the best,” Biden told reporters Monday after casting an early vote.) The left saw 2018 as a building year in Delaware, finding potential voters and linking together volunteers who could at the very least win lower-turnout elections down the ballot.  The Coons-Scarane race has not attracted the same national investments as the Carper-Harris race, when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigned in Wilmington and Justice Democrats lent staff and money for the primary challenge. Both have ignored this race, viewing others as more winnable, with the New York-based Working Families Party providing the biggest out-of-state muscle for Scarane. But the campaign itself claims to have tapped 1,200 volunteers, knocked 40,000 doors and made 900,000 calls using the Democratic voter file, while WFP has run digital ads against Coons as part of down-ballot investments in Delaware.  “Progressive donors, who used to support national Democrats but weren't as active at the local level, have been activated,” said WFP's Mid-Atlantic political director Vanessa Clifford, who co-managed the 2018 Harris campaign. “There weren't many serious challengers before Kerri's run two years ago.”  Scarane's case against Coons is simple, even if it takes some explaining at the doors. Elected in 2010, Coons has voted reliably with Democrats on their major priorities but prioritized bipartisan work while rejecting the agenda associated with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Like other Justice Democrats, Scarane puts the blame on corporate PAC money — she refuses it — and argues that Coons would impede the party's agenda if it took back power. Like Harris, she's tried to make the race a referendum on the “Delaware Way,” in which business-friendly candidates trade their seats but never enact a liberal agenda.  “There are certain people who've bought into the line that bipartisanship is important, and we need a Congress that gets along,” Scarane said in an interview at her Wilmington home. “But there are other people who see the senator as quick to run to the other side instead of standing with us on the things Democrats should be fighting for.”  Coons was not around for the votes that became vulnerabilities for Carper, like the 2002 authorization of war in Iraq. Scarane has focused instead on his support for Senate supermajority rules and questioned his commitment to supporting liberal judges. For evidence, she cites both his reluctance to end the filibuster and his 2013 vote against Debo Adegbile, an attorney nominated by President Barack Obama to help lead the civil rights division of the Justice Department.  Both questions, at the root, ask whether Coons would undermine a post-election liberal agenda. On the filibuster, Coons said he would see where events took the Senate, if Democrats took control and were trying to pass a Biden administration's agenda. Step one was trying to form consensus, and step two was tbd.  “If Minority Leader McConnell — doesn't that sound good? — uses the filibuster to block progress on any sort of legislative progress, then I'm not going to stand by and watch,” Coons said, citing immigration and gun safety as legislative priorities with Republican support. “I got to the Senate in 2011, and I'm not willing to see repeats of what he did to Obama, when we got nothing done for years.”  The Adegbile issue was trickier. When Democrats held the Senate, Coons joined every Republican and six other Democrats to block the Obama nominee. Adegbile had argued in a brief that Mumia Abu-Jamal, a death-row inmate convicted of killing a police officer, had been victimized by racially biased jury selection. The Fraternal Order of Police opposed Adegbile, and so did Coons. Reflecting on it now, Coons said, he should have worked harder to get to yes, but he said he was unable to square Adegbile's record with his feelings over the killing of the officer.  “In the run-up to the vote, I had asked Debo if he would call the widow of Dan Faulkner and express some regret about how the whole issue had ended up. And he would not. And I may have overreacted to that. I've had long conversations with the civil rights community here to say that I recognize that he would have been a great assistant attorney general for civil rights.”  Unlike Carper, Coons will end the primary without debating his opponent, depriving Scarane of the chance to confront him directly on his votes. But like many other incumbents facing challengers this year, Coons emphasized his liberal bona fides, pitching himself as a Biden ally who could get things done, and he's kept nearly every elected official in the party on his side. Bryan Townsend, a liberal state senator who won his seat by ousting the more moderate Democratic incumbent, argued that Coons's strong reputation with Republican senators positioned him perfectly to be a liberal dealmaker in a Biden-run Washington.  “Whatever his portfolio positions are, they come along with a tremendously hard work ethic and an ability to articulate the issues in a way that appeals to a broad number of people,” Townsend said. “There's a lot to be said for electing someone who is going to be able to hold the institution together from both sides, and make progress. I think in some ways he is taking undue heat for the idea that he isn't ‘progressive’ on this or that issue or sufficiently progressive, because he's focused on trying to figure out what can get done, as quickly as possible.”  While broadcasting confidence about the race, Coons has spent $4 million on his campaign, most of it on resources that can be turned around for the seven-week general election but much of it to beat Scarane. Two years ago, the left badly underestimated what it would take to beat Carper, as a surge of suburban turnout overwhelmed Harris's 29,406 votes — thousands more than her campaign thought she needed. More than 100,000 Delawareans had requested mail ballots by the end of Monday, and both Scarane and Coons were expecting high turnout.  They were seeking their final votes in very different ways. On Saturday, Coons visited some outdoor parks where his campaign had rented space for socially distant canvassing and phone-banking. He marveled at Mack McKay, a 79-year-old supporter from his church, who had made tens of thousands of calls, and he gave one caller some advice for her voter conversations: She could mention that he was one of very few Democrats who supported a commission to study reparations.  On Friday, Scarane and her supporters were at the doors, having conversations that ranged from polite to promising. Voters had nothing negative to say about Coons, and some had recollections about meeting him. Scarane kept the pitch to the agenda she'd take to Washington, always starting by saying the system was “working great for the very wealthy” and seeing where the voter took it.  “It sounds like you've got some good ideas, and we need new blood in there,” said Randi Williams, a 59-year-old lab technician. With a Senate candidate on her doorstep, Williams turned to her chief electoral concern: How would Democrats defeat Donald Trump?  Reading list  “Devastating wildfires out West inject climate change into the presidential campaign,” by Seung Min Kim and Brady Dennis  Climate change and the 2020 race.  Why Republican legislators are resisting some changes that could get votes counted faster.  Dems in disarray.  “Trump’s first indoor rally in months staged as a rebuke to coronavirus restrictions,” by Anne Gearan and Josh Dawsey  The meaning of a crowded room in Nevada.  How can a mighty field program work with voters stuck at home?  In the states  The very, very long primary season, which started in Texas six months ago, comes to an end today in Delaware.  Mostly.  Let's be sticklers. In Louisiana and Georgia, all-party primaries will be held Nov. 3 — for every major office in the former, and for the seat held by Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) in the latter. But today's contests in Delaware close the chapter on partisan primaries, and when the votes are in, nearly every two-party matchup in 49 states will be set.  Most attention will gravitate to the Coons-Scarane primary, by far the costliest race on the ballot. It's not a rematch, as Coons has never faced a well-funded challenger and Scarane has never run for office before. But in some ways, it's round two of the left's Delaware project, an effort to create a beachhead in a place that has moved away from Republicans during Donald Trump's presidency.  That project began in 2018 with Kerri Evelyn Harris's campaign, and the vote patterns today will reveal whether the left can make more gains with suburbanites. Harris did best in vote-rich New Castle County, winning 37 percent of the vote there, and ran strongest near Newark, home to the University of Delaware. She did worst in the outlying suburbs that vote Republican in general elections and worse still in Delaware's more rural counties, Kent and Sussex. Coons starts out as a heavy favorite in all three counties, and the high number of absentee ballot request and early votes — factors not there in 2018 — suggest a high-turnout election.  After 2018, Delaware Republicans were locked out of power in the state, a punctuation mark on a long decline. They have not won the state's sole seat in the House of Representatives since 2008, they have not won a Senate election since 1994, and they have been locked out of the governor's office since 1988. The party's recruitment this year doesn't point to much optimism about reversing the decline, especially with a well-liked Joe Biden leading the Democratic ticket.  Still, Republicans will field candidates for every major office on the ballot this year. The state GOP has endorsed attorney Julianne Murray for governor, but she's facing five opponents, including state Sen. Colin Bonini, who ran and lost to Democratic Gov. John Carney by 19 points in 2016. Republicans have also endorsed veteran Jim DeMartino and actor Lee Murphy, respectively, to take on the winner of the Democrats' Senate primary and two-term Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester.  Primary upsets are possible in each race. DeMartino has been heavily outspent by Lauren Witzke, a pro-Trump activist who’s tweeted the slogan (“WWG1WGA”) of the QAnon conspiracy theory movement and has been adept at getting attention despite the steep odds against her. Though not endorsed by Trump, Witzke tweeted at the president and his son Donald Trump Jr. on Monday, claiming that a child had been egged “by hateful leftists” at one of her campaign events. The president’s son retweeted it.  Murphy has raised less than $60,000 for his race, less than Witzke, but far more than his challenger, Matthew Morris. Still, Morris has gotten some attention by pitching himself as “the great American comeback story” — beating an opioid addiction to turn his life around.  Further down the ballot, the left is watching some local primaries closely, to see if they can repeat the breakthroughs they've been pulling off in other state races for city and legislative offices. The Working Families Party, which has endorsed Scarane, is backing two candidates for Wilmington's city council, Colby Owens and Shané Darby. It's also supporting four candidates in state legislative seats that are likely to go Democratic in November: Madinah Wilson-Anton, Larry Lambert, Marie Pinkney and Eric Morrison. If victorious, Pinkney could become the first Black gay woman in the state legislature; Sarah McBride, a transgender activist running for a safe state Senate seat in Wilmington, could become the state's first trans legislator if she wins today's primary.
