Bush. She added that the suit suffered from “a glaring lack of evidence tying the President’s alleged discriminatory intent to the specific TPS terminations.”\\n\\nCallahan said it was not improper for White House officials to emphatically urge officials at DHS to terminate the TPS programs. “The mere fact that the White House exerted pressure on the Secretaries’ TPS decisions does not in itself support the conclusion that the President’s alleged racial animus was a motivating factor in the TPS decisions,” she wrote.\\n\\nThe court’s majority did, in passing, deliver what read like a rebuke to Trump, saying the judges “do not condone the offensive and disparaging nature of the President’s remarks.”\\n\\nNelson, an appointee of President Donald Trump, joined Callahan’s opinion, also wrote separately to stress that the court’s ruling should not be viewed as an endorsement of the Trump administration’s decisions regarding immigrants from the four countries.\\n\\n“There is no question that these individuals deserve our sympathy. And they may well warrant legislative protection ... but that does not dictate the outcome of this case” Nelson wrote, before insisting that the court hadn’t actually passed judgment on Trump’s comments.\\n\\n“I concur in the panel’s holding, which does not opine on the moral equities or the merits of President Trump’s political statements,” Nelson added.\\n\\nNelson’s concurring opinion also criticized the nationwide aspect of the San Francisco judge’s injunction and noted that Haitians would be unaffected by the court’s ruling Monday because of the New York judge’s parallel order, which was also nationwide in scope.\\n\\n“If one out of 100 district court judges is willing to declare a statute, rule, or regulation invalid and enjoin its enforcement, the other nine—or even 99—at-bats before the judiciary have no effect,\" Nelson complained.\\n\\nJudge Morgan Christen dissented from the decision, arguing that the plaintiffs made a strong case that then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen acted arbitrarily by deciding that DHS would no longer take account of intervening events since immigrants’ home countries were designated for TPS protection.\\n\\nChristen also said those challenging the government’s action presented ample evidence that Trump’s racial bias infected the decisions. She noted not only Trump’s \"shithole countries\" comment, but his claims that Haitians with TPS status “all have AIDS” and his descriptions of Mexican and Central American immigrants as criminals and snakes.\\n\\n\"Remarkably, the government urges us to interpret the many denigrating comments in the record as descriptions of inferior living conditions in foreign countries, rather than evidence of racial animus,” Christen, an appointee of President Barack Obama, wrote. “But we cannot sweep aside the words that were actually used, and it would be worse for us to deny their meaning. Some of the statements expressly referred to people, not to places. The President’s statements require no deciphering.”\\n\\nHowever, Christen said she would have ruled that the plaintiffs were entitled to a preliminary injunction based on the legal infirmities in DHS’ change in policy for analyzing TPS, without ruling on the alleged racial bias.\\n\\nThe plaintiffs in the case, who are U.S.-citizen children of those covered by TPS, decried the ruling.\\n\\n“This government has failed me and the other 250,000 U.S. citizen children of TPS holders,” said Crista Ramos, whose mother is from El Salvador and has TPS status. “If this decision stands, it means Trump’s termination of TPS will move ahead and TPS holders will only have until January 2021 to legally live and work in this country. We need our senators to act now and pass the Dream & Promise Act to grant TPS holders a permanent residency before another wave of family separations occurs.\"\\n\\nA spokesperson for the Justice Department said officials are \"pleased\" with the 9th Circuit ruling. \"For approximately two years, the district court\\'s injunction prevented the Department of Homeland Security from taking action that Congress has vested solely within the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security — action that is statutorily precluded from judicial review. We applaud the Ninth Circuit\\'s recognition of the plain language of the Immigration and Nationality Act and its rejection of the baseless accusations of animus behind the actions taken by the Department of Homeland Security,\" the spokesperson said.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/09/21/california-schools-launch-anti-racism-plan-flouting-trumps-threats-1317670', 'Full Text': 'An empty classroom is seen at Hollywood High School in Hollywood, Calif. | Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images Education California schools launch anti-racism plan, flouting Trump\\'s threats\\n\\nSACRAMENTO — The California Department of Education announced new anti-racism lessons and teacher training for school districts on Monday, days after President Donald Trump decried the notion of teaching slavery as a founding tenet of the U.S. and called for a more “patriotic education.\"\\n\\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond pointed to the police killing of George Floyd in May, bullying of Asian American students amid the coronavirus and a spike in anti-immigrant rhetoric and antisemitism since the 2016 election as reasons for the project.\\n\\n“We have continued to watch unspeakable acts of racism play out on our television screens, whether it be police brutality or those who want to hold on to symbols that represent hate against African Americans that go back to slavery,” Thurmond said at a news conference announcing the optional materials. “At times, it just is so heartbreaking. Sometimes I’m not sure what to do. But in those moments, I’m reminded education continues to be one of our most powerful tools to countering hate.”\\n\\nLast week, Trump said he would sign an executive order to establish a \"1776 Commission,” a nod to the 1619 project, a New York Times Magazine production named after the year that the first slaves arrived in Virginia. The project has been adapted into a curriculum guide for schools to use, and focuses on the history of slavery as the root of systemic racism in the U.S.\\n\\nTrump and other Republicans have tried to discredit the project and called similar teachings in schools a “twisted web of lies.” The president threatened to defund California schools that teach the 1619 Project in a tweet earlier this month.\\n\\nThurmond dismissed those threats on Monday, and supported the use of the 1619 Project in California schools. Trump does not have the power to mandate state school curriculum.\\n\\n“I don’t know how else to say it, I thought that the president’s tweet was just ridiculous and reckless and irresponsible to in any way suggest that schools would somehow have their funding threatened for simply teaching the history and the facts that racism has existed in this country and that there are deep impacts from slavery,” he said.\\n\\nThe California Department of Education is also developing the nation’s first statewide ethnic studies curriculum model. A bill headed to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk would make that curriculum a graduation requirement for California high school students by the 2029-30 school year. Another bill signed by Newsom last month will require all undergraduate students in the California State University system to complete an ethnic studies course before graduation.\\n\\nThe new Education to End Hate initiative announced on Monday is designed to empower California’s more than 6 million K-12 students and teachers to “confront the hate, bigotry and racism rising in communities across the state and nation,” according to the state Department of Education.\\n\\nThe initiative will include a virtual classroom series on how schools can combat discrimination and provide districts up to $200,000 to support teacher training regarding anti-racism and bias. A handful of Democratic lawmakers have signed on to create additional paths for schools to address racism.\\n\\n“While President Trump and Secretary DeVos try to implement some sort of revisionist history propaganda program in our schools, California is leading the way in using education to end bigotry, hate and racism,” Rick Zbur, executive director of Equality California, which will help offer professional development for teachers, said at a news conference.\\n\\nChair of the California Legislative LGBTQ Caucus, state Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), accused Trump on Monday of trying to indoctrinate kids with his 1776 Commission. “We know that in 1776, Black people were generally slaves, women had no legal identity beyond their husbands and being LGBTQ was a capital offense,” he said.\\n\\nThe S.D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation will fund the school grants, while the National Equity Project and the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s Museum of Tolerance have also signed on to help.\\n\\n“We know that racism and hate are taught. We know that children are born loving everyone,” said Sen. Connie Leyva (D-Chino), chair of the California Legislative Women’s Caucus. “You learn what you live, and unfortunately racism and hate are still being taught in living rooms across the state of California and across this country.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/24/de-blasio-trump-empty-threat-421170', 'Full Text': 'De Blasio said the city will fight the move in court if it comes to that, but he predicted the threat would fizzle, similar to Trump’s vow to yank federal funding from sanctuary cities with immigrant-friendly policies.\\n\\n“It’s all about race, and it’s all about attempts to divide and to enthrall his base by attacking the other. This is what this guy does. It’s the only trick in his book,” de Blasio said.\\n\\n“There’s just no president in history whose been this irresponsible and divisive,” he added.\\n\\nIn its announcement, DOJ cited the spike in shootings in the city this year and a budget agreement to cut $1 billion from the NYPD, although the scope of the cuts turned out to be much smaller when full details of the budget emerged.\\n\\nThe department also cited decisions by the Brooklyn and Manhattan district attorneys not to prosecute low-level charges against protesters and the New York’s rejection of federal agents to patrol the city.\\n\\n“We cannot allow federal tax dollars to be wasted when the safety of the citizenry hangs in the balance,” U.S. Attorney General William Barr said in a statement.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/25/how-the-left-killed-another-major-nyc-development-421956', 'Full Text': 'The project’s fate was sealed when Velázquez began corralling other opponents to lobby against the plans, four sources with knowledge of the events said. The developers pulled the plug on Tuesday, six years after launching the undertaking, citing the growing political opposition and the absence of a champion in City Hall.\\n\\nThe outcome for Industry City reflects the growing influence of the Democratic Socialists of America, whose south Brooklyn chapter opposed the project’s approval. The trend has sitting politicians in some sections of the city worried they’ll face tough primaries if they don’t appear adequately aligned with left-leaning groups.\\n\\n“It’s pure politics, which we can’t afford right now,” said Kathy Wylde, head of the influential business consortium, Partnership for New York City.\\n\\nDevelopers were seeking a zoning change to expand the waterfront complex and allow more businesses, retail and academic space at the site. They were making the case to the City Council that the expected benefits merited the plan’s approval over the objection of local Council Member Carlos Menchaca, who would otherwise be given veto authority under the Council’s traditions. The argument seemed to have more weight as much of the city’s development has frozen amid the Covid-19 pandemic and New York stares down a steep drop in tax revenue.\\n\\nBut the path forward became shakier as Council Speaker Corey Johnson and Mayor Bill de Blasio remained largely absent from the debate, people familiar with the discussions said. And a letter sent to Council members Tuesday from Brooklyn’s congressional delegation and several state lawmakers — who argued the project would accelerate gentrification and displacement in the neighborhood — reflected growing opposition from powerful political players.\\n\\nIndustry City CEO Andrew Kimball said Thursday the “lack of interest at all levels, but particularly at the City Council, in engaging in a constructive dialogue” on the substance of the proposal contributed to the decision to scrap the rezoning.\\n\\n“It’s hard in a process like this when you don’t have somebody on the other side who seems eager, willing to come to the table to negotiate a plan,” he said on a call with reporters. “That became very clear, that there wasn’t that willingness.”\\n\\nThe left’s efforts on fighting gentrification already had real political consequences for establishment Democrats. In Sunset Park, longtime Assemblymember Felix Ortiz lost the seat he’d held since 1994 to newcomer Marcela Mitaynes, a tenant activist and vocal rezoning opponent, this past July. De Blasio recently backed out of a new plan for the former Amazon site in Queens over concerns about a lack of community investment.\\n\\nKimball said he heard frequently from politicians through the rezoning process that, while they liked the substance of the proposal, they couldn’t support it given the politics of the moment.\\n\\nVelázquez recruited other members of Congress to sign the Tuesday letter, including Jeffries and Yvette Clarke, both of whom represent neighboring districts, according to two of the sources. Jeffries, who is considered a moderate Democrat and has risen the ranks of House leadership, raised eyebrows as one of the signatories.\\n\\n“It was kind of the nail in the coffin,” said one Council official who, like other sources in this story, requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive subject. “The electeds in Brooklyn lean on him and his voice is very powerful. He’s a common sense elected official, he’s not far left, so when he speaks, people listen and follow.”\\n\\nJeffries’ opposition came despite support for the project from many of his political allies, including clergy members and other central Brooklyn elected officials, according to a Brooklyn political consultant who asked to remain anonymous.\\n\\n“Now [Jeffries and others] have to go back and answer to these community members, predominantly Black ones, who are like, ‘Why would you do that?’” the person said.\\n\\nJohnson, the City Council speaker who until this week was considering a run for mayor, remained noncommittal as discussions on the project continued. On Wednesday, he noted the widespread opposition to the plan from local elected officials, saying Menchaca “had a united front.”\\n\\n“The developer was not able to make the case or convince, not just the elected officials who represent the area, but a broader set of elected officials in the borough of Brooklyn,” Johnson said at a press conference. “If you can’t convince the local elected officials then that tells you where things are going to go. I don’t think it’s appropriate to think that I’m going to jump in and say that I know better than every local elected official.”\\n\\nDe Blasio, meanwhile, repeatedly declined to get involved when asked about the plan in recent weeks. The mayor, also a Democrat who ran as a progressive, has largely stepped back from his development agenda, once a core focus of his mayoralty.\\n\\nThe Council generally defers to the position of local members on land use projects. However, after Menchaca announced his opposition to the project in late July, other Council Members urged the body to support the proposal anyway. Council Members Ritchie Torres and Donovan Richards wrote a New York Daily News op-ed arguing the Council’s member deference tradition shouldn’t doom a project that could generate thousands of jobs during an economic crisis.\\n\\nNew York Playbook Our must-read briefing informing the daily conversation among knowledgeable New Yorkers.

They’re finding common cause with Cuban-Americans, who dominate Spanish-language radio airwaves and have been a bulwark of Republican support in Florida’s otherwise Democratic-leaning and diverse Hispanic communities.\\n\\nBut where radio is easy to hear for all, Facebook is harder to track. And the encrypted messaging system it bought, WhatsApp, is even more difficult.\\n\\nWhatsApp group chats are widely popular among Latin Americans and other immigrant communities in the U.S. because the app doesn\\'t require a U.S. phone number or specific mobile service provider, making it easy to stay in touch with family abroad via text or voice communication. Group chats within the closed network can easily be created with dozens of people anywhere in the world. Plus, iPhones aren’t as popular in Latin America — meaning iMessage chats are not an option for many.\\n\\nPolitical campaigns, social justice movements and support groups have followed along, making WhatsApp a top tool for reaching voters in Latin America and from Latin America.\\n\\nIn South Florida, veteran Latino Democratic strategist Evelyn Pérez-Verdia noticed this summer that the WhatsApp groups dedicated to updates on the pandemic and news for the Colombian and Venezuelan communities became intermittently interspersed with conspiracy theories from videos of far-right commentators or news clips from new Spanish-language sites, like Noticias 24 and PanAm Post, and the YouTube-based Informativo G24 website.\\n\\n“I’ve never seen this level of disinformation, conspiracy theories and lies,” Pérez-Verdia, who is of Colombian descent, said. “It looks as if it has to be coordinated.”\\n\\nRepublicans say people on both sides of the political aisle are sharing disinformation organically, although they can’t point to similar conspiracy theories espoused by the left. And they accuse Democrats of labeling every opinion or news story they disagree with as disinformation.\\n\\nFor instance, in a Covid WhatsApp chat group, a Republican posted a statement that real Catholics can’t be Democrats, which Pérez-Verdia found objectionable. But the group chat’s founder and administrator, businessman and former Republican Miami-Dade County Commission candidate Alfred Santamaria, said he didn’t ban the comment because he believed people should have freedom of expression.\\n\\nFlorida Playbook Our must-read briefing on what’s hot, crazy or shady about politics in the Sunshine State.

I see a level of tension of people posting for and against the administration,” he said.\\n\\nSome of the information shared in chat groups and pulled from YouTube and Facebook goes beyond hyperbolic and caustic rhetoric.\\n\\nOn Informativo G24, longtime Colombian news anchor Sandra Valencia brings on guests via webcam for discussions about Latin America and U.S. politics with analysis that often relies on conspiracy theories, such as how Black Lives Matter and other activist groups are planning a “siege” on the White House later this month. The site does not detail who funds it, but asks supporters to donate to a PayPal account registered to Valencia.\\n\\nValencia bills her Spanish-language YouTube page, which has more than 378,000 followers, as a channel for geopolitical analysis. But it often resembles English-language right-wing news sources, such as Infowars, sharing conspiracy theories and strong anti-globalization messages.\\n\\nAnd unlike the conspiracy theories that circulate in English-language news media and social media, there’s relatively little to no Spanish-language media coverage of the phenomenon nor a political counterpunch from the left.\\n\\nSome of the disinformation discussed on Informativo G24 has been led by Omar Bula-Escobar, a former United Nations representative and Colombian geopolitical analyst, who in recent years has become a frequent guest on various Latin American radio and television news shows to talk about globalization. Bula-Escobar, who’s also a frequent guest on Miami-based Radio Caracol — which is one of Colombia’s main radio networks and widely respected throughout Latin America — has gained an increasing amount of notoriety for pushing the claim, often seen as anti-Semitic, that billionaire George Soros is “the world’s biggest puppet master” and is the face of the American Democratic Party.\\n\\n“Who’s going to celebrate the day, God forbid, Trump loses? Cuba; ISIS, which Trump ended; Hezbollah, which Obama gave the greenlight to enter Latin America; Iran; China … All the filth of the planet is against Donald Trump. So, if you want to be part of the filth, then go with the filth,” Bula-Escobar said in a recent episode of Informativo G24.\\n\\nOther shared content has included a translated clip of Christian conservative pastor John MacArthur claiming there is no pandemic and coronavirus death numbers have been wildly exaggerated.\\n\\nIn June, a Noticias 24, a Venezuela-focused news site that has a large following in Latin America, amplified disinformation with a story bearing the headline “social networks also accuse Joe Biden of being a pedophile.” A month later, when the lie resurfaced, “#BidenPedofilio” trended in Spain.\\n\\nOn Facebook, a Puerto Rican-born pastor Melvin Moya has circulated a video titled “Signs of pedophilia” with doctored videos of Biden inappropriately touching girls at various public ceremonies to a song in the background that says, “I sniffed a girl and I liked it.” The fake video posted on Sept. 1 has received more than 33,000 likes and 2,400 comments.\\n\\nMuch of the shared content cannot be traced to a specific campaign or political organization. Still, fake videos and news stories are being widely shared in Facebook groups offering support for Trump.\\n\\nAnd various fake stories across WhatsApp and Facebook claim that Nicolás Maduro’s socialist party in Venezuela and U.S. communist leaders are backing Biden.\\n\\n“It’s really just a free-for-all now,” said Raúl Martínez, a Democrat who served as mayor of the largely conservative, heavily Cuban-American city of Hialeah for 24 years and is now host of a daily radio show on Radio Caracol. “It’s mind boggling. I started in politics when I was 20. I’ve never seen it like this.”\\n\\nMartínez, 71, said it has been particularly frustrating to see the prevalence of disinformation in South Florida Spanish-language stations, which many older Latinos in the area still rely on for information.\\n\\n“When I hear from other stations, they haven’t just sipped the Kool-Aid. They drank the whole thing,” Martínez said.\\n\\nRadio Caracol, for its part, received unwelcome attention Aug. 22 when it aired 16 minutes of paid programming from a local businesssman who launched into an anti-Black and anti-Semitic rant that claimed a Biden victory would mean that the U.S. would fall into a dictatorship led by “Jews and Blacks.” The commentator claimed that Biden is leading a political revolution “directed by racial minorities, atheists and anti-Christians” and supports killing newborn babies.\\n\\nWhen Miami state Sen. Annette Taddeo, a Colombian-American who is also Jewish, heard the programming, she quickly called out the station on Twitter for “the disgusting message, spoken by Trump supporters,” adding that “We all — regardless of parties — have an obligation to repudiate and condemn this pro-Nazi and racist discourse.”\\n\\nHowever, the 16-minute program did not receive coverage from local media outlets despite the outwardly racist and xenophobic messaging, a reminder that much of the Spanish-language disinformation and conspiracy theories circulating in South Florida remain unchecked.\\n\\nCaracol management promptly apologized for the content and said it banned the commentator, local businessman Jorge Gonzalez, from the airwaves. A Caracol spokesman said Gonzalez had initially purchased the radio time to talk about business, not politics, let alone racist politics. Gonzalez couldn’t be reached for comment.\\n\\nThen, on Friday, the editor of the Spanish-language sister paper of The Miami Herald, El Nuevo Herald, publicly apologized for its own paid-media scandal after running a publication called “Libre” as a newspaper insert that attacked Black Lives Matter and trafficked in anti-Semitic views.\\n\\n\"What kind of people are these Jews? They\\'re always talking about the Holocaust, but have they already forgotten Kristallnacht, when Nazi thugs rampaged through Jewish shops all over Germany? So do the BLM and Antifa, only the Nazis didn\\'t steal; they only destroyed,” the ad insert said .\\n\\nThe publication said it\\'s suspending its relationship with Libre.\\n\\nConspiracy theories — especially revolving around QAnon, which posits that Trump is fighting a global cabal of satanic pedophiles — are spreading across Spanish-language radio in Miami as well, said Roberto Tejera, a political independent who has a show on Actualidad Radio. Tejera said QAnon is a constant on another station, La Poderosa, whose station management also did not respond to messages seeking comment.\\n\\n“It’s not right wing. I don’t have a problem with right-wing stuff. It’s QAnon stuff. This is conspiracy theory. This goes beyond. This is new. This is a new phenomenon in Spanish speaking radio. We Cubans are not normal,” Tejera laughed, “but this is new. This is crazy. This is f---ing crazy.”\\n\\n\\n\\n'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/09/20/ruth-bader-ginsburg-conservatism-418821', 'Full Text': 'For non-lawyers, such political grades ascribed to judges by outsiders might signal personal penchants rather than an intellectually honest approach to hard legal questions. Deemed “the most important woman lawyer in the history of the Republic,” Ginsburg did urge courts to draw a once-novel conclusion about the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids government from “deny[ing] to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws”: that it should operate to stop arbitrary laws based on gender.\\n\\nNote that “person,” “equal,” and “protection” are all terms the Constitution does not explicitly define. Absent a constitutional amendment—which takes an affirmative vote of two-thirds of both houses of Congress and ratification by three-quarters of the states—these words are among many in the Constitution that the Supreme Court must ultimately define. (Congress can provide legislative definitions, but the high court can strike those down.) Because the constitutional text is vague, for many years the Equal Protection Clause was read to tolerate laws that effectively deprived women of the same opportunities men enjoyed in all realms of public life. That narrow, male-only reading of the Constitution allowed the government to ban women from working as lawyers or bartenders, for example. It prevented women from serving on juries or lifting more than 15 pounds on the job. Through her work as a lawyer and jurist, Ginsburg prompted the Supreme Court to read the Equal Protection Clause to constrain arbitrary legal constraints on people of all genders.\\n\\nIs this a radical, leftist idea? Would a more conservative approach have confined the meanings of “person,” “equal,” and “protection” to the prevailing understanding of those terms in 1868, when the 14th Amendment was ratified amid post-Civil War Reconstruction? Some judges, lawyers and scholars would argue that only the original public meaning is relevant even today. But in 1868, Webster defined the word “protection” to include numerous meanings, including “[t]he act of protecting or preserving from evil, injury, or annoyance,” as well as a slew of synonyms: “Preservation; guard; shelter; refuge; security; safety.” Which of these would a conservative judge pick? Which would a liberal one choose? The fact that this exercise doesn’t fit neatly into political definitions of liberal and conservative is something Ginsburg acutely understood.\\n\\nYou probably know what I’m getting at here: Many people—even some with a nuanced understanding of legal and constitutional interpretation—argue that “good” judges do not read anything into the Constitution, but stick to its plain language (so-called “textualists” or “originalists), and “bad” judges treat the document as a blank slate on which to craft a wish list for social reform (so-called “living constitutionalists”). Ginsburg defied this false dichotomy by routinely applying conservative analytic principles in the service of causes that might be considered politically liberal. Yet troublingly, this false dichotomy has become de rigueur in our national conversation about presidential candidates and potential Supreme Court picks. It is corrosive.\\n\\nFor Ginsburg, adherence to procedure, principles of federalism, judicial independence and ensuring that government does not wield arbitrary power over regular people were hallmarks of her jurisprudence. This list is not stereotypically progressive. If anything, it has marks of conservatism.\\n\\nOn what remains perhaps the most sensitive constitutional question of our time, whether the Constitution protects against government’s interference in a woman’s decision to medically terminate a pregnancy, Ginsburg was critical of the court’s decision in Roe v. Wade, which lodged abortion rights—rather precariously, it turns out—as a matter of privacy under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. For her, it was more about gender equality under the Equal Protection Clause.\\n\\nAlthough both due process and equal protection appear in the 14th Amendment, due process has its roots in English common law, dating as far back as the Magna Carta of 1215. The notion is that the government cannot take someone’s life, liberty and property without fair notice and a hearing. But the Constitution doesn’t specify protections for numerous liberties that most Americans would assume are bound up in the idea of freedom from arbitrary confinement. So the Supreme Court long ago identified certain basic rights as nonetheless protected under the Due Process Clause, including the right to decide one’s own medical care and to raise children according to one’s own values and not the dictates of the government. It’s this concept of “substantive” due process that undergirds Roe.\\n\\nBy contrast, equal protection is a uniquely American standard that was designed to stop states from discriminating against formerly enslaved Black people. Ginsburg perceived equal protection as a more natural means of ensuring a woman’s ability to keep government out of her personal medical decisions relating to the female reproductive system. Ginsburg also feared that Roe went too fast for the public which, ironically, had been steadily moving toward legalizing abortion through state legislatures, not the courts. The court “ventured too far in the change it ordered in Roe,” she wrote in a 1985 law review article.\\n\\nOn a range of other cases, Ginsburg cast votes that were not decidedly liberal, and in fact might have gone differently had she been an elected politician and not a judge with life tenure.\\n\\nConsider, for example, Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, in which Ginsburg in 2002 dissented from the majority’s decision that struck down, on First Amendment grounds, a Minnesota canon of judicial conduct that barred candidates for elected judgeships from publicly expressing their political views. Like Scalia, who wrote the majority opinion, Ginsburg was a reliable defender of First Amendment rights, writing numerous majority opinions. But in White, she took the position that candidates for elected judgeships must sacrifice certain constitutional rights if they are to preserve another “essential bulwark of constitutional government,” i.e., “[t]he guarantee of an independent, impartial judiciary.” For Ginsburg, “[u]nlike their counterparts in the political branches, judges are expected to refrain from catering to particular constituencies or committing themselves on controversial issues in advance of adversarial presentation.” (To be sure, Ginsburg stoked controversy when she publicly expressed concerns about Donald Trump’s possible election in 2016.)\\n\\nScalia took direct aim at Ginsburg in his opinion, expressly rejecting her “resort to the notion that the First Amendment provides less protection during an election campaign than at other times.” But Ginsburg’s emphasis on judicial restraint, favoring social change through the legislature rather than through the courts, is hardly a touchstone of liberalism. One could argue that her defense of judicial independence is no less an example of classic conservative jurisprudence than Scalia’s insistence on unfettered free speech. The unabashedly conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch has likewise insisted that the Constitution’s framers “charged individuals insulated from political pressures with the job of interpreting the law and applying it retroactively to resolve past disputes.”\\n\\nIn a 2019 case called United States v. Sineneng-Smith, as well, Ginsburg wrote an opinion for a unanimous court reversing a 9th Circuit ruling that a federal statute making it a felony to encourage entry of aliens into the United States violated the First Amendment on free speech grounds. The case arose from a conviction of a California-based immigration consultant who was prosecuted and convicted under the law. Despite her strong support for First Amendment and immigrant rights, Ginsburg wrote that “the Ninth Circuit’s radical transformation of this case goes well beyond the pale.”\\n\\nAlso in 2019, she voted with conservative Justices Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh to reject a criminal defendant’s argument that his period of supervised release cannot be paused during his detention over a new criminal offense, concluding that pretrial detention does not qualify as imprisonment within the meaning of federal law. Gorsuch joined Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan in dissent, charging the majority with misconstruing the law and creating “needless uncertainty and unfairness.” Court watchers were surprised by the ideological breakdown.\\n\\nJust this year, Ginsburg joined Kagan’s majority opinion in Kelly v. United States, which reversed the fraud convictions of two associates of former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in connection with their closure of several lanes of the George Washington Bridge in retaliation against a local mayor’s refusal to endorse Christie for reelection. Kagan reasoned that the scheme did not aim to obtain money or property so as to trigger the criminal fraud laws. Christie, of course, is a Republican.\\n\\nGinsburg also sided this year with the conservative wing of the court in endorsing the construction of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline beneath the Appalachian Trail—to the chagrin of environmentalists—as well as the Trump administration’s policy of expediting deportation of people seeking asylum in the United States. In the latter case, Department of Homeland Security v. Thuraissigiam, Ginsburg again opted to reverse a decision of the famously liberal-leaning 9th Circuit.\\n\\nConsider, too, Ginsburg’s adherence to principles of federalism—the view that states’ autonomy is essential to confining the grandiose power of the federal government. This, again, is an approach to constitutional interpretation that typically leans conservative. In BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, she penned a dissent to the majority’s 1996 decision to strike down a $2 million punitive damage award that had been upheld by Alabama courts on due process grounds. “The Court,” she wrote, “unnecessarily and unwisely venture[d] into territory traditionally within the States’ domain.”\\n\\nSomewhat remarkably, as a D.C. Circuit judge Ginsburg dissented from that court’s majority opinion striking down the Ethics in Government Act, a statute passed in the wake of the Nixon Watergate scandal that authorized appointment of a prosecutor outside the president’s chain of command to look into alleged presidential wrongdoing. On appeal, a 7-1 majority of the Supreme Court in 1988 adopted her view in Morrison v. Olson, upholding the law (which eventually expired). Six years later, independent counsel Kenneth Starr was appointed under the law for purposes of investigating President Bill Clinton, the man who put Ginsburg on the Supreme Court. Clinton was later impeached based on Starr’s report of his findings. Famously, Scalia dissented in the Morrison case.\\n\\nPerhaps in an ironic twist, it was Joe Biden as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee who argued in his questioning of Ginsburg that judges ought to lead society in some circumstances. As a Supreme Court nominee being interviewed for the job, then-Judge Ginsburg demurred. “Judges must be mindful of what their place is in this system and must always remember that we live in a democracy that can be destroyed if judges take it upon themselves to rule as Platonic guardians,” she said.\\n\\nThe Senate should heed Justice Ginsburg’s exquisitely blended strains of legal conservativism and liberalism as they contemplate who has the intellectual rigor, honesty and temperament to replace her.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2020/09/13/trump-on-alleged-police-shooters-animals-that-must-be-hit-hard-490312', 'Full Text': 'POLITICO Playbook: Trump on alleged police shooters: ‘Animals that must be hit hard!’ Presented by Facebook\\n\\nFollowing reports of two Los Angeles County police officers being shot, President Donald Trump tweeted of the alleged shooters: \"Animals that must be hit hard!” | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo\\n\\nDRIVING THE DAY\\n\\nGOOD SUNDAY MORNING.

A massive scoop by DAN DIAMOND landed at 10:25 p.m. Friday night: “Trump officials interfered with CDC reports on Covid-19”\\n\\n-- DAN’S STORY deserves a full read, but here are some highlights: “The health department’s politically appointed communications aides have demanded the right to review and seek changes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s weekly scientific reports charting the progress of the coronavirus pandemic, in what officials characterized as an attempt to intimidate the reports’ authors and water down their communications to health professionals.\\n\\n“In some cases, emails from communications aides to CDC Director Robert Redfield and other senior officials openly complained that the agency’s reports would undermine President Donald Trump’s optimistic messages about the outbreak, according to emails reviewed by POLITICO and three people familiar with the situation. …\\n\\n“[S]ince Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign official with no medical or scientific background, was installed in April as the health department’s new spokesperson, there have been substantial efforts to align the [Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports] with Trump’s statements, including the president’s claims that fears about the outbreak are overstated, or stop the reports altogether.\\n\\n“Caputo and his team have attempted to add caveats to the CDC’s findings, including an effort to retroactively change agency reports that they said wrongly inflated the risks of Covid-19 and should have made clear that Americans sickened by the virus may have been infected because of their own behavior, according to the individuals familiar with the situation and emails reviewed by POLITICO. …\\n\\n“In one clash, an aide to Caputo berated CDC scientists for attempting to use the reports to ‘hurt the President’ in an Aug. 8 email sent to CDC Director Robert Redfield and other officials that was widely circulated inside the department and obtained by POLITICO.”\\n\\nBIG DURHAM NEWS … HARTFORD COURANT: “Nora Dannehy, Connecticut prosecutor who was top aide to John Durham’s Trump-Russia investigation, resigns amid concern about pressure from Attorney General William Barr,” by Edmund Mahoney: “Federal prosecutor Nora Dannehy, a top aide to U.S. Attorney John H. Durham in his Russia investigation, has quietly resigned — at least partly out of concern that the investigative team is being pressed for political reasons to produce a report before its work is done, colleagues said.\\n\\n“Dannehy, a highly regarded prosecutor who has worked with or for Durham for decades, informed colleagues in the U.S. Attorney’s office in New Haven of her resignation from the Department of Justice by email Thursday evening. The short email was a brief farewell message and said nothing about political pressure, her work for Durham or what the Durham team has produced, according to people who received it. …\\n\\n“Colleagues said Dannehy is not a supporter of President Trump and has been concerned in recent weeks by what she believed was pressure from Barr, who appointed Durham, to produce results before the election. They said she has been considering resigning for weeks, conflicted by loyalty to Durham and concern about politics.”\\n\\nKYLE CHENEY: “Johnson seeks IG probe of wiped Mueller team phones”: “Senate Homeland Security Chair Ron Johnson is asking a Justice Department watchdog to probe recently revealed documents that suggest members of special counsel Robert Mueller’s team wiped records from their official phones.\\n\\n“Records released by the Justice Department this week in response to a Freedom of Information Act request suggest top Mueller aides erased the information from at least 15 phones, citing forgotten passwords, physical damage and missing hardware.”\\n\\nA message from Facebook: Facebook supports updated internet regulations We support updated internet regulations to set clear rules for today’s toughest challenges and hold companies, including Facebook, accountable for:\\n\\n— Combating foreign election interference\\n\\n— Protecting people's privacy\\n\\n— Enabling safe and easy data portability between platforms\\n\\nRead more\\n\\nWHAT AMERICA IS READING … THE NATION’S FRONTS: S.F.

Bush administrations drafting plans for distributing vaccines and personal protective gear, dramatically ramping up testing, reopening schools and addressing health-care disparities.\\n\\n“The effort began six months ago when the campaign consulted David Kessler, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner under Presidents Bush and Bill Clinton, and Vivek H. Murthy, surgeon general under President Barack Obama, on how to run a presidential campaign during a pandemic.\\n\\n“The pair, along with a growing cadre of volunteer health experts, has been working behind the scenes to craft plans that could take effect Jan. 20, when the next president will take the oath of office, said Jake Sullivan, a senior policy adviser on the Biden campaign.”\\n\\nELENA SCHNEIDER and ALEX THOMPSON: “Biden’s transition team, fearing Trump’s moves, sets massive fundraising goal”: “Joe Biden’s transition team has expanded its fundraising goal far beyond what Hillary Clinton raised in 2016, anticipating that, should they prevail in November, the Trump administration could actively work against their efforts and that the coronavirus pandemic will make a presidential changeover more difficult than ever.\\n\\n“The Biden transition team is aiming to raise at least $7 million by Election Day and build a staff of at least 350 people, according to a person familiar with the transition’s planning, while another person said the total fundraising goal is $7 million to $10 million.\\n\\n“The budget far exceeds the $2.1 million that Clinton raised for her transition planning by Election Day 2016, or the $6.5 million Trump’s transition raised before he assumed the presidency. Mitt Romney in 2012 raised $8.9 million for what is considered the most robust prior effort to plan a transition hand-off between two different parties.\\n\\n“Several people involved in raising money for Biden’s transition said the pitch to potential donors leans on fears that President Donald Trump will not ease the handover process if he loses. That possible complication, along with the dueling health and economic crises hitting the country, will require more staffing and resources for a Biden administration-in-waiting.”\\n\\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

Taken together, the president’s lobbying campaign, amplified with Twitter blasts, and the advertisements of former vice president Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential nominee, blaming Trump for empty stadiums signal the potential potency of college football among some voters in the coming election. …\\n\\n“Trump took interest in the season’s viability the day before the Big Ten’s decision, retweeting a post by Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence in support of the athlete-driven #WeWantToPlay movement. Lawrence and Trump spoke later in the week by phone, the president said at a news conference on Aug. 15, when he mentioned the recent postponements by the Big Ten and the Pac-12 and said, ‘I wish they would come back.’ (Clemson, a member of the A.C.C., is playing this season.)\\n\\n“The Big Ten’s move left Trump aides bombarded with requests for White House intervention. Many of the pleas went to Timothy Pataki, a senior official who played lacrosse at Ohio State and remained close to the school, among the most vocal in its opposition to the decision not to play on time this fall. Late last month, Pataki contacted Warren and asked whether he would be willing to speak with the president. Trump called the next morning.”\\n\\nBIZ SAYS THANKS BUT NO THANKS TO TRUMP …\\n\\n-- NYT’S JIM TANKERSLEY: “Trump’s Payroll Tax ‘Cut’ Fizzles”: “More than a month after Mr. Trump signed an executive memorandum to defer the collection of the payroll taxes that workers pay to help fund Social Security, few companies or people are taking part. Trade groups and tax experts say they know of no large corporations that plan to stop withholding employees’ payroll taxes this fall. As a result, economic policy experts now say they expect the deferral to have little to no effect on economic growth this year.”\\n\\n-- WSJ’S RICH RUBIN: “Some Large Employers Reject Trump’s Payroll-Tax Deferral Plan”: “Some of the nation’s largest employers -- including CVS Health Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and the U.S. Postal Service -- say they won’t implement President Trump’s payroll-tax deferral plan, opting to leave employee paychecks alone this fall. …\\n\\n“Other large employers, including United Parcel Service Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Costco Wholesale Corp. and Home Depot Inc., say they aren’t participating either. Wells Fargo wanted ‘to avoid creating a future financial burden for employees,’ said spokesman Peter Gilchrist.”\\n\\nPORTLAND PRESS HERALD: “Lively U.S. Senate debate puts front-runners Collins and Gideon on the hot seat,” by Kevin Miller: “[T]he debate … highlighted major policy differences between the two front-runners on issues such as access to quality health care. ‘We need to ensure access and that means maintaining our rural hospitals,’ said Collins, who is seeking a fifth six-year term in the Senate. ‘The proposal that Sara has endorsed would destroy our rural hospitals.’ …\\n\\n“Trump also was a focal point in the debate, with Gideon at one pointing asking Collins a question that the senator has been fielding for months but so far has declined to answer: whom will she support in the upcoming presidential election.\\n\\n“‘I don’t think that the people of Maine need my advice on whom to support for president,’ Collins replied. ‘Last week I was on a bus tour all over the state of Maine. Not a single person asked me who should be the next president. What they did say was how grateful they were for the Paycheck Protection Program that I wrote because it preserved their job or their small business.’”\\n\\nPOMPEO IN DUBAI … AP/DUBAI: “Warring Afghans meet to find peace after decades of war”\\n\\nAXIOS’ BARAK RAVID: “Behind the scenes of the U.S.-brokered Israel-Bahrain agreement”: “After the visit in Israel and the UAE last week, [Jared] Kushner and his delegation traveled to Bahrain.

But the group's ethnical and cultural diversity makes it a particularly difficult one for the political world to understand, and an extremely difficult one for both parties to appeal to.\\n\\n“That is one of the challenges I am most concerned about: that the Democrats and Biden haven’t done the work again to increase support among Latino voters,” said Valencia. “If the work has not been done to increase support among Latino voters in this last push, and white swing voters regress to the mean in any way … we are in a position where either the election is a lot closer than it should be — when there could have been greater margins — or we’ve lost the election on the margins.”\\n\\nValencia is encouraged by a new sense of urgency she has seen from the Biden campaign in recent weeks, including substantial investments in ads in Spanish-language media. “They’re not just translating their ads for the general electorate into Spanish — which is what you often see — or Google Translating ad copy and putting it up on the website,” said Valencia.\\n\\nOne point that concerns Valencia is where messaging intersects with a very real gender gap. Latina women support Biden over Trump by massive margins, but they vote at lower levels than white women or Black women. Combine that with the reality of campaigns — “you often end up focusing on the people we know are definitely going to vote [and] nonvoters get kind of stuck in a cycle of not being communicated with” — and Democrats are leaving potentially millions for Biden off the table.\\n\\nAs the presidential campaigns descend on swing states, Valencia spoke with POLITICO on Wednesday to sort through the complexities of the Latino vote — including the notion that there is such a thing. A transcript of that conversation is below, condensed and edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nZack Stanton: We have less than seven weeks until the election. What is the state of the presidential race when it comes to Latino voters?\\n\\nStephanie Valencia: All paths to 270 [Electoral College votes] lead through the Latino electorate. Whether that path includes Arizona and Florida, or the upper-Midwest states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, every single path requires reaching and engaging Latino voters. There’s a very clear path forward for what needs to get done in the last 48 days, where the opportunity and the challenges still lie.\\n\\nHistorically, what we’ve seen happen is that maybe we get a poll or two of Latinos if a presidential campaign hires a pollster in time — and it may or may not be very robust. Otherwise, we’re kind of left with what we saw a couple of weeks ago out of the NBC/Marist poll in Florida, which kicked off a bunch of the panic we’ve seen over the last few weeks. But in that poll, the sample size of Hispanic likely voters was only 138.\\n\\nJoe Biden, it’s no secret, didn’t win the Latino vote in the primary. There were some unique issues that Bernie Sanders was able to tap into that really related to the everyday lives of Latinos in this country, including universal access to quality health care, free community college and getting advanced degrees without acquiring a lot of debt, and immigration. And what our latest polling shows is that Joe Biden has been able to recoup and to consolidate a lot of that support, but there are obviously places where he needs to continue to do more.\\n\\nStanton: You mentioned the recent polls that are freaking out Democrats. Comparing Trump in polls now to 2016, he seems to be doing better among Latino voters. Why is that?\\n\\nValencia: You have to look state by state to really understand what’s driving that. When you look at a place like Florida, where a lot of the alarm was raised over the last week, by our measure, Biden is doing fairly well among Latinos: 53-37 head-to-head against Trump. That’s been a relatively stable marker.\\n\\nWe tend to look at Latino voters in Florida in a very binary way: If we’re not talking about Cubans, then we’re talking about Puerto Ricans. But only a third of the Latino electorate in Florida is actually Cuban-American — it’s very important, but it is only a third. More than one-third is actually not Cuban or Puerto Rican. They’re Mexican. They’re Colombian. They’re Peruvian. They’re Ecuadorian. Combined with the Puerto Rican community, they’re much more similar to each other than not.\\n\\nAmong that [non-Cuban Latino] community, I think the numbers are closer to 60-31 in favor of Biden. When you take Cuban-Americans out of the equation, there’s a much different picture in place in Florida, and a lot of room to have a conversation with a set of voters that campaigns don’t really talk about or think about communicating with — that non-Cuban, non-Puerto Rican population.\\n\\nWhat’s interesting about the Cuban-American vote is that really since the Obama era, you have seen a lot of investment [by Republicans] in communicating the “socialism” message [about Democrats]. That has helped bring a lot of Cuban-Americans who may have voted for Obama home to the Republican Party. But fundamentally, there are still many chunks of that Cuban-American population that are persuadable and still gettable for Democrats.\\n\\nThat said, I don’t think Democrats should have a hand-to-hand combat message war over “socialism.” Where Trump has an Achilles’ heel — where he is weakest, even in a place like Florida with Cuban-Americans — is on health care, his handling of Covid and the current state of the economy. That’s really the proactive messaging that Biden and Democrats should be communicating.\\n\\nStanton: There’s typically this idea from pundits that Latino voters will recoil at the mention of “socialism.” Perhaps that’s true of Cuban-Americans in Florida. But what we saw from Bernie Sanders was quite the opposite — he had strong support from Latino voters. Why was that, and what did pundits get wrong?\\n\\nValencia: There are a couple really interesting takeaways from our research. One is the gender divide. Over the course of the last year, we’ve seen some pretty historic gaps between Hispanic men and Hispanic women. What’s interesting — relating back to Bernie — is that a lot of his support was not driven by young Hispanic men; it was actually driven by young Hispanic women. In the broader electorate, there was this picture of “Bernie Bros.” In the Latino community, it was actually young Latinas — often, non-college-educated single women — who, quite frankly, are a huge opportunity for Joe Biden. It’s one of the universes that we saw in this last round of research that really needs that nudge to vote for Biden.\"}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/newsletters/huddle/2020/09/21/republicans-line-up-behind-swift-scotus-vote-490388', 'Full Text': \"Republicans line up behind swift SCOTUS vote Presented by\\n\\nPAYBACK’S A MITCH -- Buckle up, because it’s about to get wild — and ugly — on Capitol Hill. The death of liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and President Donald Trump’s push to fill the seat ASAP has teed up one of the most ferocious and consequential confirmation battles in the Senate’s history, which is landing in the middle of the election season and amidst a global health pandemic.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — who is undeterred by accusations of hypocrisy and whose legacy will be defined by his confirmation of conservative Trump judges — is vowing to fill the vacancy this year. And McConnell has already locked down support from key Republicans to move ahead with a quick vote. Democrats, meanwhile, are promising to raise hell — and warning of possible payback if they win back the Senate.\\n\\nHere’s everything you need to know about the historic Supreme Court showdown:\\n\\n1) THE TIMING: It’s still up in the air when McConnell will hold a final confirmation vote, though he will get the ball rolling on the whole process as soon as Trump nominates a replacement, which is expected to happen soon. McConnell will huddle with his leadership team tonight and then meet with the entire Senate GOP conference for their weekly lunch on Tuesday, which could produce some more clarity on the timing issue.\\n\\nBut there’s two schools of thought here: McConnell could hold a vote in the lame-duck session of Congress, which could protect vulnerable Republicans who are up for reelection and allow the GOP to use the looming confirmation vote as a motivating factor to juice the base in November. This also makes the most sense from a calendar perspective, as the average Supreme Court confirmation process takes more than two months from start to finish.\\n\\nOr, McConnell could try to wrap this up before Election Day. The benefit there is that if Trump loses the White House, some moderate Republicans might not be comfortable voting for the outgoing president’s nominee. Plus, McConnell might be working with a slimmer majority in the lame-duck if Democrat Mark Kelly wins a special election in Arizona and is sworn in this fall. But GOP Sen. Roy Blunt cautioned that “to get it done before Election Day everything has to work I think pretty precisely.”\\n\\n2) THE MATH -- McConnell can only afford to lose three Republicans. Two GOP lawmakers — Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — have already publicly come out against holding a vote before the election. And Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden implored Republicans to “follow your conscience.”\\n\\nBut other key Republicans have lined up behind McConnell’s strategy of holding a swift vote. That includes retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander, an institutionalist; Sen. Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a top Trump ally who is up for reelection; Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), a moderate; and Sens. Thom Tillis and Martha McSally, who are both in tough races.\\n\\nWho we’re still waiting to hear from: Sen. Mitt Romney, who voted to convict the president during the impeachment trial and who has no loyalty to Trump; Sen. Chuck Grassley, who chaired the Judiciary Committee when Obama appointed (but the GOP refused to hold hearings on) Merrick Garland; and Sen. Cory Gardner, who is facing a competitive reelection battle in the purple state of Colorado and has hewed closely to Trump.\\n\\nBut as we’ve seen pretty consistently on Capitol Hill, the political calculation for most Republicans tends to be that they have more to lose than gain by bucking Trump. The latest on the whip count from Andrew and Nolan McCaskill: https://politi.co/32OIJBw .\\n\\n3) THE DEM STRATEGY -- If McConnell has the votes for Trump’s nominee, there is nothing Democrats can do to stop the GOP from ramming it through. But Democrats may at least try to use some procedural tactics to slow down the process. Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested that Dems “have arrows in our quiver that I’m not about to discuss right now.”\\n\\nBut Pelosi shot down the idea of holding up government funding as a way to delay the Senate from filling the vacancy. Current government funding runs dry on Sept. 30 (more on that later). “None of us has any interest in shutting down government so I would hope that we could just proceed with that,” Pelosi told ABC’s “This Week.” But the truth is, there’s not a whole lot Dems can do here.\\n\\n4) THE LONG-TERM IMPACT -- This partisan brawl will only further inflame an already polarized Senate, which could leave a long-lasting mark on the institution. In fact, progressives want Democrats to fight fire with fire — and Senate Dems are suggesting possible retaliation if they win back the Senate and the GOP succeeds in appointing Trump’s nominee to the high court.\\n\\nDuring a Democratic conference call Saturday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told his colleagues that “nothing is off the table for next year” and “everything Americans value is at stake.” Progressives are not only pushing to eliminate the legislative filibuster, but also calling to expand the Supreme Court. And momentum for both ideas — which would fundamentally alter the institution — is only going to grow in the coming weeks.

Here’s the latest on the funding fight, from Caitlin Emma and Bres: “Congressional leaders missed a self-imposed deadline on Friday to strike an agreement on legislation that would keep the government open through Dec. 11, with House Democrats now hoping to file the stopgap spending bill by Monday.\\n\\n“Lingering issues over a White House demand to deliver tens of billions of dollars in trade relief for farmers — which Democrats oppose — ultimately caused the delay, while lawmakers made progress in other areas. Democrats and Republicans have clashed for days over when the continuing resolution should expire and which funding and policy exceptions should be included.\\n\\n“Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were ticking through some of the biggest unresolved issues on Friday, congressional aides said.

Three key Republican holdouts — Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado, Joni Ernst of Iowa and Chuck Grassley of Iowa — all broke their silence yesterday and signaled support for McConnell moving ahead with the confirmation vote.\\n\\nNow, all eyes are on Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who has no loyalty to the president and isn’t up for reelection this year. But he also hails from a religious state and has been a pretty reliable conservative vote for the GOP, other than his vote to convict Trump in the impeachment trial earlier this year. “This is a lot different than impeachment,” cautioned Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). “I would be very surprised if Romney doesn’t vote for the nominee.”\\n\\nBut keep in mind: Only two GOP senators have come out in opposition to holding a confirmation vote this year, so that means McConnell can afford to lose Romney, with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a tie. And at this point, it’s unclear where a fourth “no” vote would come from. So far, however, Romney is remaining tight-lipped: “I\\'m not gonna speak about this until I had a chance to speak with my colleagues,” he told reporters. A closer look at Romney’s crossroads from Burgess — who is back from paternity leave just in time for this madness! — and Marianne: https://politi.co/35Xc3rm .\\n\\nA message from McDonald\\'s: Ron started as a crew member at McDonald’s in Oakland, CA where he found an exciting path. Thanks to college tuition assistance from McDonald’s, Ron became the first college graduate in his family, and today works in Operations at McDonald’s headquarters. Learn how Ron and others succeed at McDonald’s.\\n\\nMEANWHILE … Trump is pushing the GOP to confirm his Supreme Court nominee before the November election, and a handful of Republicans have echoed similar calls. But yesterday, GOP leaders were not committing themselves to a timeline. During a Monday floor speech, McConnell didn’t specify a date for the vote other than “this year,” while GOP senators emerged from a leadership meeting last night equally non-committal.\\n\\nYet Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said on Fox News last night that there’s momentum in the GOP for a quick vote on the yet-to-be-named nominee. \"We\\'ve got the votes to confirm Justice Ginsburg\\'s replacement before the election, we\\'re going to move forward in the committee, we\\'re going to report the nomination out of the committee to the floor of the United States Senate so we can vote before the election,” he said. Graham also pleaded for more campaign cash— a sign of just how much Republicans are being outraised. Watch.\\n\\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), however, made clear he has no qualms about filling the vacancy during the lame-duck session of Congress, which would be even more controversial if Trump loses the White House and could raise questions of legitimacy for Trump’s nominee (whom he is expected to announce Saturday). And holding it in the lame-duck could be risky, since McConnell may be working with a slimmer majority if Democrat Mark Kelly wins a special election against Martha McSally in Arizona. All the latest on the state of play from Andrew, Burgess and Marianne: https://politi.co/33RwaVt .\\n\\nTHE GOP, HOWEVER, is still trying to fend off accusations of hypocrisy from Democrats. And Republicans have made a litany of arguments to justify their moves, including: Democrats would have done the same thing if the roles were reversed … When Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, the Senate and White House were controlled by different parties … It’s the GOP’s constitutional duty and the reason they won the majority … and Dems essentially brought it upon themselves with their treatment of Brett Kavanaugh.\\n\\nDemocrats, however, point out that in March 2016 — when Garland was nominated — the GOP argued that voters in the upcoming presidential election should have a say in the process. And now we’re even closer to the election, with early voting already underway. During a floor speech, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued Republicans “have no right to fill it” and warned that this will “spell the end of the greatest deliberative body.” More from Marianne on the GOP’s SCOTUS defense: https://politi.co/3mBdyBH .\\n\\nOTHER NOTABLE SCOTUS developments on Capitol Hill yesterday: Sen.

Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) feels pretty confident that Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who is on Trump’s SCOTUS shortlist, supports overturning Roe V. Wade … Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, said she doesn’t support packing the courts or ending the filibuster.\\n\\nRelated reads: “Democrats largely powerless to stop GOP from confirming Trump’s court choice,” by WaPo’s Paul Kane and Rachael Bade: https://wapo.st/3cr5ZJ1 ; and “How Ginsburg’s Death Has Reshaped the Money Race for Senate Democrats,” from NYT’s Shane Goldmacher and Jeremy W.

McAllister, a policy official at the trade association CropLife America, urged U.S. agriculture officials to fight any effort to include the words ‘crops’ or ‘fungicides’ in the guidelines — a position that would run counter to growing international consensus that the overuse of antifungal compounds is a threat to human health by contributing to drug resistance and should be monitored. … When the Codex Intergovernmental Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance met in South Korea several months later, the American delegation insisted that the guidelines omit any references to fungicides, a stance that infuriated other participants and forced a monthslong delay in the task force’s work.\\n\\n— \"The emails, which were written in 2018 and obtained through a lawsuit by the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental advocacy group, offer a behind-the-curtain peek at how the powerful pesticide industry influences policy decisions that can affect billions of people across the globe. In a statement, the U.S.D.A. said the email exchanges were simply part of the agency’s process for crafting its official position. ‘It is the normal course of business for U.S.D.A. to solicit input from industry when developing a technical document in order to understand current practice in the United States,’ the agency wrote.”\\n\\nMEANWHILE, IN CALIFORNIA: “A state investigation into the country\\'s largest natural gas utility is steadily piecing together details of how the company may have cloaked its advocacy by recruiting local politicians and minority groups to promote fossil fuels at California ports, according to people familiar with the probe and documents obtained by POLITICO,” POLITICO California’s Colby Bermel reports. State utility watchdogs are examining whether Southern California Gas “acted unlawfully in its lobbying efforts as the company fights the state\\'s transition away from oil and gas.”\\n\\n— “The Public Advocates Office, an independent branch of the California Public Utilities Commission, launched an investigation last year when it found SoCalGas spent ratepayer dollars to start a group opposed to cities phasing out or banning natural gas in new buildings. The company ‘is working to undermine state policy through lobbying and other efforts to misinform the public and encourage the continued usage of natural gas,’ the PAO wrote this summer. The PAO probe has since widened to include other SoCalGas activities, including the company\\'s relationship with Imprenta Communications Group, a public affairs firm focused on issues in minority communities.”\\n\\nANNALS OF ELECTION FUNDING: “Facing mounting expenses and with Congress yet to provide more money, election administrators across the country are struggling to meet the extraordinary costs of holding an election amid a pandemic,” The New York Times’ Ken Vogel reports. “With Election Day a little more than five weeks away and early voting underway in some states, many municipalities and states are turning to alternative sources of funding, most notably $300 million in grants from the Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.”\\n\\n— “But now even that money is becoming enmeshed in partisan disputes, with conservative groups opening a legal assault on Thursday to block private grants from going to election administrators in Democratic strongholds in four swing states, arguing they will disproportionately help Democrats like the party’s presidential nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr. … Erick G. Kaardal, a lawyer affiliated with the Thomas More Society, a conservative nonprofit legal group that has been aligned with the Trump administration, predicted Mr. Zuckerberg’s grants would set a bad precedent.” The Thomas More Society said it filed lawsuits in federal court on Thursday against localities that received nearly $26 million from one of the groups to which Zuckerberg gave, the Center for Tech and Civic Life.\\n\\nNew Joint Fundraisers\\n\\nCollins Maine Victory (Sen.

Act on the news with POLITICO Pro.\\n\\nQuick Fix\\n\\nLast week, and six months into the coronavirus pandemic, the federal worker safety agency issued its first Covid-19-related citations in the meatpacking industry, where the United Food and Commercial Workers estimated that more than 18,000 workers have been exposed to the virus. But the union, which represents meatpacking workers, said the citations issued against a Smithfield plant in South Dakota and a plant owned by JBS Foods in Colorado are a “new low” for the Trump administration.\\n\\nTogether, the fines against the two companies totaled roughly $29,000, despite a combined total of at least 12 worker deaths and almost 1,500 infections due to outbreaks at both plants, according to Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the UFCW.\\n\\nEmployees of two departments at the Smithfield pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, S.D. report to work on May 4, 2020. | AP Photo/Stephen Groves\\n\\nWith the fines, OSHA and the Department of Labor “prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they do not care about holding irresponsible corporations accountable for the lives lost or worker safety,” UFCW President Marc Perrone said in a statement.\\n\\nFormer OSHA officials say the agency could have charged more. “OSHA went VERY VERY easy on Smithfield,” tweeted Dr. David Michaels, head of OSHA during the Obama administration. He said the agency “could have issued numerous citations” one for each of the areas the agency found the company failed to protect workers. He added that “if OSHA asserted they were willful, the penalty could be 10X as high.” (OSHA’s maximum fine for a “willful” citation is $134,937.)\\n\\nFor its part, the Trump administration has declined to issue mandatory safety rules during the pandemic, instead offering optional guidelines, which it maintains are sufficient to shield workers from the coronavirus. “OSHA has meatpacking industry guidance and other resources to assist in worker protection,” said OSHA Denver Area Director Amanda Kupper in a statement in the citation issued to JBS Foods.\\n\\nBut federal OSHA officials recently admitted during proceedings in a lawsuit filed by workers at a Maid-Rite Specialty Foods plant in Pennsylvania that the guidelines require nothing of factory managers. Although OSHA inspectors witnessed employees working “2 to 3 feet” apart without physical barriers — which goes against the Centers for Disease Control’s advice and OSHA’s safety recommendations — the agency concluded there was no “imminent danger” at the plant that needed to be immediately addressed by the company. OSHA said that its work isn’t done at the Maid-Rite Specialty plant and that it has six months to issue a citation.\\n\\nBecause OSHA hasn’t issued Covid-19-specific safety regulations, as Democrats and unions have called for, the agency could only cite Smithfield and JBS under a provision in the 1970 statute that created OSHA called the “general duty clause.” The provision requires businesses to maintain “a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm” to employees.\\n\\nOSHA has rarely used the general duty clause in enforcement — in part because it’s a cumbersome legal tool that requires review from the higher ranks at the agency, which can take time. The provision also has a four-part legal test that makes it vulnerable to court challenge. (More on that here.) Both Smithfield and JBS have 15 business days to contest the citations.\\n\\nGOOD MORNING. It’s Monday, Sept. 14, and this is Morning Shift, your tipsheet on employment and immigration news.

In a temporary rule that will be published in the Federal Register Wednesday, the DOL clarifies that health care providers are employees who “provide diagnostic services, preventive services, treatment services, or other services that are integrated with and necessary to the provision of patient care.”\\n\\nThe DOL also reaffirmed a provision of its original rule that allows employers to withhold paid leave if they have no work for employees to perform and a requirement that workers must seek permission from their employer to take intermittent leave. Both of these sections of the original rule were invalidated under the August court order, but DOL is now providing more explanation of the legal basis for those provisions.\\n\\nOn the Hill\\n\\nPREGNANT WORKER PROTECTIONS BILL TO HIT HOUSE FLOOR: The House Rules committee will meet at 1 p.m. to prepare H.R. 2694 (116), The Pregnant Workers’ Fairness Act, for floor debate, readying it for a full House vote this week. The legislation would require employers to provide reasonable accommodations to help pregnant workers continue working and would also bar employers from denying employment opportunities to them because they are pregnant.\\n\\nIn the States\\n\\nCABBIES POISED FOR REBOUND IN AB 5 FIGHT: If Uber and Lyft pull out of the Golden State over California’s Assembly Bill 5, taxi drivers “are eager to let the public know that they are ready to take up the slack,” Carolyn Said reports for the San Francisco Chronicle.\\n\\n“Taxis have already matched some Uber and Lyft features,” Said writes, “such as apps for summoning vehicles, on top of phone dispatch and street hails, neither of which are available from the ride-hailing companies.” The threat of the ride-hailing apps leaving California has even helped business, Hansu Kim, owner of a taxi company based in San Francisco, told the Chronicle. He said he’s received inquiries “from companies that wanted to open corporate accounts.”\\n\\nBACKGROUND: “The two ride-hailing companies threatened to temporarily cease service in California because of a preliminary injunction in a court case seeking to force them to reclassify drivers as employees. They won a temporary reprieve, but it’s unknown how they’ll react if Proposition 22, a ballot measure they are backing that would permanently keep drivers as independent contractors, does not pass in November.”\\n\\nImmigration\\n\\nICE DEPORTATION ARRESTS RESUME: A nationwide immigration enforcement operation was announced this month, “the first large-scale arrests and deportations in the interior of the country since the coronavirus pandemic halted field operations for several months,” Miriam Jordan reports for The New York Times. “Since mid-July, immigration agents have taken more than 2,000 people into custody from their homes, workplaces and other sites, including a post office, often after staking them out for days.”\\n\\nWHO WAS TARGETED? About 85 percent of those caught in the sweep “either had criminal convictions or pending criminal charges,” Jordan reports. “But analysis of the totality of the government’s own data shows that the administration is arresting large numbers of undocumented immigrants whose crimes are minor, or who have not committed any crime at all.”\\n\\nWHY? As Jordan explains: “These immigrants are easier to locate and remove precisely because they are not trying to evade law enforcement, even if they have outstanding deportation orders.”\\n\\n2020 Watch\\n\\nBIDEN COURTS BLACK FARMERS: “The Biden campaign has spent the summer criticizing discrimination in agriculture, organizing roundtable discussions and tapping former Black government officials in an aggressive push to attract Black farmers, a small but potentially significant slice of the rural vote,” our Ximena Bustillo reports. “Farmers of color, numbering more than 260,000 nationally, make up between 10 and 65 percent of farmers in almost a dozen states, including swing states of Arizona, Florida and Nevada.”\\n\\n“Black farmers have long struggled to get equal access to USDA programs that help build credit and address civil rights complaints,” Ximena writes. “They have pushed the government for more enforcement to retain land that has been in their families for generations at a time when farmers, generally, are facing unprecedented economic headwinds due to the pandemic and trade war disruptions. The Biden campaign has released a plan to work with nonwhite farmers to tackle these issues.”\\n\\nWhat We're Reading\\n\\n— “From a stable job to a tent: A waiter’s homeless struggle,” from The Associated Press\\n\\n— “The Maitre d’ Will Take Your Temperature Now,” from The New York Times\\n\\n— ICYMI: “ICE flew detainees to Virginia so the planes could transport agents to D.C. protests.

Gavin Newsom? If you’re thinking, “yes,” then you may be either a masochist or the mayor of San Diego.\\n\\nCalifornia governors regularly have to navigate deficits and disasters — but the cascading crises of Newsom’s administration have set a new bar. Ask former Gov. Gray Davis, who has some experience with tenure-derailing cataclysms.\\n\\n“Most governors will experience some form of crisis,” he told us. “Either a substantial recession, wildfires, earthquakes — that comes with the territory. But I think Gov. Newsom clearly wins the prize for having to cope with the most crises at the same time.”\\n\\nGov. Gavin Newsom holds his son Dutch while speaking during his inauguration Monday, Jan. 7, 2019, in Sacramento, Calif. | AP Photo/Eric Risberg\\n\\nRemember Newsom’s triumphant inauguration in January of 2019? A humming economy was fueling a budget surplus and the telegenic new governor — with a nationally covered assist from his adorably intrepid toddler — was pitching California as a progressive lodestar and the counterweight to Trumpism. Weeks later, PG&E declared bankruptcy, setting off a fight that would overshadow Newsom’s first year.\\n\\nCalifornia’s intensifying homelessness crisis was supposed to be the focus of 2020, with Newsom dedicating most of his second State of the State speech to the issue — and then the coronavirus overtook everything (and separately, those vaunted housing production goals collided with political reality). Blackouts, catastrophic wildfires, a president who relishes targeting California and yet whose help Newsom must seek — you name it. POLITICO’s Debra Kahn, Alexander Nieves and Jeremy B. White dug into why Newsom has one of the hardest political gigs in America. It’s our latest feature for The Fifty, a POLITICO series that covers the outsize role governors and mayors are playing in America today.\\n\\nDespite all those headwinds, Newsom’s constituents are still largely with him. Per the latest Public Policy Institute of California poll, both likely voters and all adults give Newsom sturdy approval ratings of around 60 percent for his governorship in general and his coronavirus handling specifically — markedly better ratings than the Legislature draws, and inversions of President Donald Trump’s continually abysmal California numbers.\\n\\nBut plenty of political peril still looms between Newsom and another term — or beyond. Lockdown fatigue and the prolonged pain of businesses struggling to stay afloat are fueling angst, as is the state’s universally panned unemployment system. Severe housing and homelessness issues that preceded the pandemic could be exacerbated by its economic ravages, as could the state’s nation-leading poverty rate. So, like we said: Do you really want his job?\\n\\nBUENOS DÍAS, good Wednesday morning. Attorney General Xavier Becerra is testifying to Congress today about California’s new data privacy law, which the California Department of Justice enforces on California businesses. He’ll address the Senate Commerce Committee starting at 7 a.m. PST.\\n\\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: “To this day we have a Commander in Chief of the United States of America who is holding rallies with no masks, because, you see, he has convinced everyone that you’re on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask and you’re on the other side if you don’t. Making value judgments about people who are concerned with not dying.” Sen. Kamala Harris at a Detroit campaign event, on the day America surpassed 200,000 coronavirus deaths (some 15,000 in California).\\n\\nTWEET OF THE DAY: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez @AOC joins a progressive Feinstein pile-on: “Sen. Feinstein’s protection of the filibuster is unjust & unacceptable. The filibuster wasn’t made w/ purpose. It‘s the result of an accident in rulebook revision & bloomed as a cherished tool of segregationists. Now it empowers minority rule. That’s not ‘special,’ it’s unjust.”\\n\\nWHERE’S GAVIN?

The divergent rules have both sharpened differences between California and D.C. and divided the industry — and Ford’s new spot calls out rivals Chevrolet, Jeep and Toyota for siding with the Trump administration. The campaign also entails a new website.\\n\\nGIG CLASH — “DOL releases proposal on gig worker classification under minimum wage, OT law,” by POLITICO’s Rebecca Rainey: “The rulemaking will be closely watched by app-based companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash, as their workers are generally classified as independent contractors. Those companies are currently battling a new law in California that would make most of their drivers employees, warning that the change would upend their business model.”\\n\\n— THE KEY CA LINE: “The Department believes adopting the ABC test” — the standard set out by the California Supreme Court and advanced by AB 5 — “as the [The Fair Labor Standards Act’s] generally applicable standard for distinguishing employees from independent contractors would be unduly restrictive and disruptive to the economy,” the feds wrote.\\n\\nKAMALA CRED — “GOP senators who play with fire with the Supreme Court will get scorched,” opines the WaPo’s Jennifer Rubin: “The Democratic nominee for vice president, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), sits on the Judiciary Committee.

State lawmakers ordered the audit to determine if UC officials were admitting unqualified students due to influential connections.”\\n\\n— “The dungeon master,” by the Sacramento News & Review’s Raheem Hosseini: “Jail deaths climbed to their highest number last year under Sheriff Scott Jones—a fact the three-term lawman largely withheld from the media.”\\n\\n— “Inside The Chaos of Immigration Court,” by Gabriel Thompson for Longreads: “The court, especially under Trump, is a battlefield on which the rules are constantly shifting. At the front line of that battle, two conflicting imperatives meet. The first is Constitutional: the right to due process — for an immigrant to receive a full hearing in front of an impartial judge. The second is political: Trump wants to deport asylum seekers quickly.”\\n\\n— “Climate Disruption Is Now Locked In. The Next Moves Will Be Crucial.,” by the NYT’s John Branch and Brad Plumer: “One hope raised by some experts is that the current onslaught of fires and storms — the death, the destruction, the apocalyptic skies — might motivate people to unite behind calls for action. ‘Those orange skies — I mean, that was scary,’ said Kris May, a climate scientist and coastal engineer in San Francisco.”\\n\\n— “California Republican lawmaker said his party asked for state pay cuts. It didn’t,” by the Sac Bee’s Wes Venteicher.\\n\\n— “She tried to rent motel rooms for homeless people. A NIMBY hospital stopped her,” by the LA Times’ Erika D. Smith: “What has gone down in Kern County this year, culminating in a particularly dispiriting Bakersfield City Council meeting this month, is so ridiculous on its face that it’s almost laughable.

However, during previous periods of unrest in Sri Lanka and Myanmar, the company took action including reducing the reach of content shared by repeated rule-breakers, and limiting the distribution of ‘borderline content’ that was sensationalist but did not quite breach its hate speech rules. “\\n\\nHOLLYWOODLAND\\n\\n— “‘Amazon Room’ Becomes Hot Amenity for Hollywood Homebuyers Amid Pandemic,” by The Hollywood Reporter’s Hadley Meares: “In a COVID-19 world, buyers are looking for a room to store the many packages that arrive, and also a spot for them to decontaminate before opening.”\\n\\nMIXTAPE\\n\\n— “Flu shots in the Bay Area: where to get yours, and why they’re important during pandemic,” by the SF Chronicle’s Annie Vashstein.\\n\\n— “A family called 911 for son’s mental health crisis.

Jared Walczak, who has studied this tax at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, agreed that these centers are not “employment heavy,” but said they are high paying jobs. New Jersey companies that do business with the data centers could also lose out, Walczak said. Walczak, who serves as the vice president of state projects, said the idea of taxing these transactions is a complex one. The actual trading floors are in New York, whereas the only activity happening in New Jersey is the digital processing of the transaction. Since the stock exchanges have servers elsewhere, it would be relatively “simple” for them to process transactions somewhere else, he said.\\n\\nMCKNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR — Lawmaker to introduce new bill granting subpoena power to police review boards, by POLITICO’s Sam Sutton: Assemblymember Angela McKnight plans to introduce a new version of a bill that would allow civilian complaint review boards to subpoena records and investigate police officer misconduct concurrently with internal affairs units. The bill would also appropriate $600,000 for the Attorney General’s office to develop a training program for county or municipal review board members. Board members would be required to complete training prior to investigating officers or departments, according to a copy of the legislation provided to POLITICO. “To watch the killing of George Floyd nationally, so many people saw it, and then to read about the killing of Breonna Taylor, it did shine the light brightly [on police violence],” McKnight (D-Hudson) said in an interview late Monday afternoon. “Things happen for a reason ... and I pray for their families, but they’re not going to die in vain.”\\n\\nFUNDS TO BE USED TO RENOVATE STATEHOUSE AFTER CHRISTIE’S RENOVATION IF MURPHY DOESN’T LIKE IT — “New Details on NJ borrowing plan as fight looms over tax estimates,” by NJ Spotlight’s John Reitmeyer: “According to budget documents and recent testimony during hearings before lawmakers, Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration is planning to use a 10-year repayment schedule for a total of $4 billion in new debt to help fund a nine-month budget he put forward last month. Annual interest on the bonds could be around 2%, and repayment would begin almost immediately at a cost of about $400 million annually in a full budget year, Department of Treasury officials told lawmakers last week. They also made a commitment to refrain from back-loading debt or using balloon payments, something that prior administrations have done to reduce short-term pain, even when it has driven up the total cost for future generations … The new details about the proposed borrowing suggest the Murphy administration is taking a restrained approach, at least initially ... But there are brewing concerns that the final decisions on borrowing will be made entirely behind closed doors”\\n\\n—“NJ budget: Taxes, more debt, ballooning pensions and more undesirable choices on the table”\\n\\nNO EVIDENCE OF KNOWLEDGE TRANSMISSION EITHER — “No evidence of in-classroom transmission as number of COVID-19 cases at N.J. schools rises, state says,” by NJ Advance Media’s Kelly Heyboer: “Though at least six New Jersey school districts have reported positive COVID-19 cases in the first two weeks of in-person classes, none of those cases are believed to be incidents where students or teachers caught the coronavirus in the classroom, state officials said Monday. Schools in Howell, Frankford, Little Silver, Chatham and Washington Township in Gloucester County and a county vocational school in East Brunswick have all switched to remote learning or asked some students to stay home due to positive COVID-19 cases. It is believed the students and teachers who tested positive all got the coronavirus outside of school and no one they came into contact with in the classroom has contracted COVID-19, Gov.

In the months since, some of the state’s 9 million residents received a $1,200 stimulus check, applied for expanded unemployment benefits, and sought opportunities for aid through the federal Paycheck Protection Program or small business loans. But more than 722,000 residents who are not documented were left out of pandemic relief due to citizenship status, according to a new study released Monday by Make the Road New Jersey, an immigrant advocacy group that works closely with the Latino community.”\\n\\nDANNY DEVITO URGED NOT TO INVITE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER TO N.J.— “N.J. preparing for ‘twin-demic’ with flu season piling on coronavirus outbreak, top health official says,” by NJ Advance Media’s Matt Arco: “New Jersey residents should get flu vaccinations as soon as possible to avoid a potential ‘twin-demic’ that could stress the state’s healthcare system if there’s also a spike in the coronavirus pandemic, the state’s top health official said Monday. “As we enter the fall season, we are also moving into the flu season.

But state emergency management officials say New Jersey school districts will be covered with a shipment of 2.4 million masks from the federal government. “As many students and teachers across our state and our country head back to school, FEMA’s policy will likely make it harder for state and local governments. This will hamstring efforts to slow the spread of the virus and prolong this pandemic,” a bipartisan group of New Jersey Congress members wrote in a letter to Peter Gaynor, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Eleven of the 12 members of New Jersey’s House delegation signed the letter. Only Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew did not.\\n\\nKNIGHTS OF ROUND TABLE KNOW AN ARTHURIAN WHEN THEY SEE ONE — “I know an authoritarian when I see one,” by Bob Menendez for Univision: “In my 28 years in Congress, I have fought for democracy, freedom and human rights and against dictatorships around the globe—from China, to Cuba’s communist regime, to Maduro\\'s socialist catastrophe. My family has lived under dictators in Cuba. I know an authoritarian when I see one. When the President of the United States calls the free press the enemy of the people, I hear the words of dictators. When the President sends in troops to silence peaceful protestors, as he did outside the White House for a photo op, I see the Castros who routinely use state forces against political dissidents.”\\n\\n—“U.S. Chamber Of Commerce Endorses Kean For Congress”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA message from Masterworks:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLOCAL\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW MUCH MORE PPE COULD THE DISTRICT BUY WITH INZELBUCH’S $600K SALARY? — “Lakewood schools: Board lawyer Inzelbuch takes spotlight; teachers chafe over \\'dangerous actions,” by The Asbury Park Press’ Gustavo Martinez Contreras: “It\\'s the start of another school year in Lakewood and Michael Inzelbuch is out front again. Literally. The Board of Education attorney was outside the middle school chasing after the teachers\\' union president as reporters sought to conduct on-camera interviews. When Kimberlee Shaw, Lakewood Education Association president, turned left, so did Inzelbuch. When Shaw turned right, Inzelbuch followed, like a duckling chasing its mother. He butted in again and again, seizing the spotlight. The interviews were a bust. ‘You (Shaw) don\\'t do nothing for Lakewood. Let\\'s meet,’ Inzelbuch interjected. Inzelbuch\\'s outsize role in directing the 6,500-student district has long attracted attention from union leaders, politicians and watchdog groups, but he is even more prominent than usual, with the pandemic swirling in the background and Lakewood attempting to offer what few New Jersey districts are: a nearly normal school experience.”\\n\\nNEXT YOU’LL TELL ME STUDENTS WHO DON’T GO TO CLASS WON’T PASS — “Paterson schools dock pay of 450 employees in COVID-19 dispute, teacher\\'s union says,” by The Paterson Press’ Joe Malinconico: “About 450 Paterson educators who didn\\'t report to their schools for an in-person class preparation day on Sept. 1 will find their paychecks a little short on Tuesday, according to the city teachers\\' union. Superintendent Eileen Shafer is carrying out her warning that employees who didn\\'t come to work would be docked for the preparation day, despite the union’s assertions that the district failed to provide sufficient health protection for staffers amid the COVID-19 crisis. The union argued the school lacked proper ventilation and sufficient plexiglass partitions.

The earthquake that hit Los Angeles hours later felt like divine punctuation.\\n\\nThere were glowing tributes to Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s towering legacy.\\n\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi: “Every woman and girl, and therefore every family, in America has benefited from her brilliance.”\\n\\nRep. Katie Porter: “I’m thinking today about Justice Ginsburg’s remark that there will be enough women on the Supreme Court when there are nine.”\\n\\nRep. Jackie Speier: “We have lost an American Icon of untold proportions, a feminist with the steeliest spine, and a jurist of remarkable talent, legal precision, and a yearning for justice for all.”\\n\\nGov. Gavin Newsom: “Our hearts ache tonight. Let us honor her memory by preserving the very ideals she fought so tirelessly for.”\\n\\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi arrives to pay her respects at the makeshift memorial for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in front of the Supreme Court on September 20, 2020. | Samuel Corum/Getty Images\\n\\nEven California Republicans praised her fortitude. But other, more visceral reactions of the “NOOOOO” variety underscored the enormous political repercussions. We saw more than a few calls for Democrats to pack the court if they reclaim Congress.\\n\\nAnd plenty of Democrats framed this as a call to action: “We must pick up the pieces and pick up the fight,” urged former Sen. Barbara Boxer. “Cry. Scream. Have a meltdown. Then get into warrior mode,” advised Planned Parenthood’s Jodi Hicks.\\n\\nAt stake long-term are a suite of policies cherished by California Democrats, preeminently Obamacare — which state Attorney General Xavier Becerra is fighting to preserve in court. Rep. Adam Schiff said on Sunday that “our health is on the ballot,” echoing a top-down party focus on that issue.\\n\\nBut the ripples are far wider. California voters could reinstate affirmative action in November by passing Proposition 16; a solidly conservative court could invalidate such diversity-boosting measures. Gun control, abortion rights — the list goes on. “HEY 2020, WE DON’T NEED A REMINDER HOW HIGH THE STAKES ARE,” Newsom administration official Jason Elliott wrote.\\n\\nKAMALA’S ROLE: Perhaps more than any California politician, Sen. Kamala Harris will be in the thick of what comes next. She’ll be hammering the SCOTUS vacancy as a presidential ticket member.\\n\\n“The stakes of this election couldn’t be higher,” she said on Twitter. “Millions of Americans are counting on us to win and protect the Supreme Court—for their health, for their families, and for their rights.” The Biden-Harris ticket shattered fundraising records in the hours after Ginsburg’s death was announced. “Today,” announced a Harris fundraising email, “we fight for her legacy.”\\n\\nAnd as you may remember, Harris sits on a certain committee with jurisdiction over court appointments. Her prosecutorial grilling of Senate Judiciary witnesses vaulted her into the national consciousness, playing no small role in her presidential prevalence — and so it’s something of a full-circle moment that a fight redefining the presidential race will put Harris in the brightest Senate spotlight. She’ll be joined by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who cited Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s infamous blocking of nominee Merrick Garland in saying, “Under no circumstances should the Senate consider a replacement for Justice Ginsburg until after the presidential inauguration.”\\n\\nNewsom doesn’t get a vote, but he was excoriating Republicans on that point: “Mitch McConnell. 2016. Never forget,” he tweeted, citing the Garland incident. He quoted Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Lindsey Graham as having staked out similar positions, telling his followers that this is “the only time in my life I have ever recommend[ed] that we do what Lindsey Graham says: USE HIS WORDS AGAINST HIM.” And a Newsom fundraising missive urged donors to channel money to Senate Democrats: “The most important thing we can do right now is to elect a Democratic Senate Majority that will appoint a Supreme Court Justice who believes in equality and the rule of law.”\\n\\nBUENOS DÍAS, good Monday morning. Former Gov. Jerry Brown is buoying the Biden-Harris campaign today, joining a climate roundtable hosted by the Nevada State Democratic Party that will focus on how a Biden administration would differ on climate from the Trump administration.\\n\\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: “There cannot be one set of rules for a Republican President and one set for a Democratic President, and considering a nominee before the next inauguration would be wholly inappropriate. We urge you to adhere to your own words and commit publicly that you will not consider any nominee to fill Justice Ginsburg’s seat until after the next President is inaugurated.” Senate Judiciary Democrats, led by Feinstein, make their plea in a letter to Senate Judiciary Chair Graham.\\n\\nTWEET OF THE DAY: Newsom chief of staff @Ann_OLeary posts an impassioned RBG thread: “While I am not radical, I am ready to fly to DC in the middle of COVID19 and lay my body on the floor of the United States Senate to prevent a vote from occurring before the next term of Congress.”\\n\\nBONUS TOTD: WSJ reporter Christine Mai-Duc @cmaiduc: “Welp I just screamed ‘2020 IS THE WORST YEAR EVER’ and my husband had to remind me our daughters were, in fact, born this year”\\n\\nWHERE’S GAVIN? #NewsomAtNoon — Gov.

Consider who owns the building. The lobby features signs for Vornado Realty Trust, the publicly traded firm, with innumerable shareholders, that has a 70% stake in the tower.

House Democrats couldn’t surmount their impasse with the White House after Pelosi’s negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin underscored the substantial daylight between both sides. The House passed Democrats’ $2.2 trillion plan on a largely symbolic and party-line vote last night, but members will head back to their districts without a deal to tout to voters they’re telling to reelect them, as POLITICO’s Sarah Ferris, Melanie Zanona and Heather Caygle report.\\n\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi talks to reporters in the House Visitors Center at the U.S. Capitol on October 01, 2020. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\\n\\nThat forces California into the kind of fiscal pain this year’s budget hoped to avoid. The deal Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders struck delayed some $11 billion worth of reductions and deferrals, making those cutbacks contingent on getting federal aid by Oct. 15. It now looks exceedingly unlikely those funds will arrive in California’s accounts in two weeks. POLITICO’s Katy Murphy has detailed how that would hit courts, higher education, state workers and others.\\n\\nWhile Newsom has publicly projected optimism about reinforcements arriving, many California Democrats are resigned to waiting for a new president. When you see California Democrats campaigning and raising money for Joe Biden, remember that it isn’t just about the Supreme Court or health care or the environment. It also involves a basic dollars-and-cents calculus. In this view, stabilizing California’s economy — and forestalling an avalanche of evictions and foreclosures next year — depends to a great extent on who’s in the White House.\\n\\nBUENOS DÍAS, good Friday morning. BREAKING LAST NIGHT: President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for Covid-19. “We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “We will get through this TOGETHER!“ In other coronavirus news, an appeals panel on Thursday declined to halt California’s pandemic-related restrictions on religious gatherings. While the U.S. Supreme Court has already backed Newsom on this issue in May, that was a 5-4 ruling — and a Justice Amy Coney Barrett could tip the balance if this goes back to SCOTUS.\\n\\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: “You cannot get closer to total disobedience of any kind of law.

White: “Still, the party has lots of work to do. There are still fewer registered Republicans than there were between 2000 and 2012, although the party is rebounding from its 2016 nadir. … Democrats saw the largest overall gains since last cycle, adding some 1.6 million registered voters. Their edge over Republicans increased by some 1.3 million voters between 2016 and 2020.\\n\\n“And the numbers could indicate a negative development for Republicans: more no-party-preference voters registering as Democrats. While Republican\\'s share of the electorate remained stable from 2018 to 2020, Democrats expanded their share as the proportion of party-less voters declined. … There are now 21.2 million registered voters, which is 84.7 percent of the eligible voter pool — the highest share in the last 68 years.

Gavin Newsom had some ‘splainin’ to do Monday.\\n\\nTHE PROBLEM: How is it that California — the vaunted capital of the “innovation economy,’’ home to the giants of Silicon Valley, and “America’s next coming attraction,’’ as Newsom likes to brag — still uses an ancient computer language called COBOL and an IT system that dates back to the earliest days of the internet to handle the unemployment claims of millions of California workers?\\n\\nThat’s what Newsom was forced to address Monday. His “strike force” released a report Saturday with recommendations for improving California\\'s backlogged Employment Development Department, which has become the latest albatross around the governor’s neck since the start of the pandemic. Constituents across the state have reported nightmares at EDD, with the unemployed unable to get through the online claim systems or to reach the department by phone. Some filed claims but never received checks. EDD head Sharon Hilliard projected this week it will take until the end of January to get through the current backlog. To turn things around, the report noted, the department needs to take a two-week \"reset\" before it can accept applications from first-time applicants, POLITICO’s Katy Murphy reported.\\n\\nGov. Gavin Newsom gives an update on the state\\'s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in Rancho Cordova, Calif., June 26, 2020. | AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, Pool\\n\\nHE BURIED THE LEAD: Despite the shock at news that unresolved claims are growing to the tune of 10,000 a day — as the LA Times’ Patrick McGreevy reported — and the potential implications for millions of Californians, Newsom buried the lead in his briefing Monday. After a scathing op-ed from the Sac Bee\\'s Gil Duran on Newsom’s weekend dump of information — which critics said aimed to minimize its impact — the governor addressed the EDD crisis, though only after wildfire and Covid-19 updates, including a new PSA on masks starring Oscar the Grouch.\\n\\n“The work we have to do is self-evident as it relates to unemployment and support for those that are trying to navigate our unemployment and pandemic unemployment assistance system here in the state of California,’’ Newsom said. “This system is an old, 30-plus-year-old technological system. … These legacy COBOL systems that need to be upgraded, frankly, need to just simply be strewn to the waste bin of history.\\n\\nSo now, critics and political opponents have emerged in force to lambaste the Newsom team’s report, which in effect called for a complete system overhaul. (The governor said the Saturday night report release came because “I didn’t want to wait another day.”)\\n\\nAmong them was San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, reported to be exploring a possible run for governor, who tweeted: “It feels like doctors might develop a COVID vaccine before the State of California figures out how to send unemployment checks to people on time. There’s a backlog of 1.5 MILLION unemployment claims. How are Californians supposed to provide for themselves, for their families?”\\n\\nAnd John H. Cox, the Republican who ran against Newsom in 2018 — and is exploring another go — told POLITICO Monday that “the world has undergone this complete technological revolution the last 20 years. This is inexcusable, that our government hasn\\'t. And why? You know, we\\'ve had plenty of money to spend on a train that’s way over-budget. Right.”\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE: With state unemployment at 11.4 percent, and millions counting on those checks, Newsom vowed that tackling problems in the aging system will help Californians get help from EDD faster and far more efficiently in the future. Still, he didn’t offer any timeline on when the relief will be coming.\\n\\nIn other words: “The check’s in the mail”?\\n\\nStay tuned.\\n\\nBUENOS DÍAS, good Tuesday morning. Laid-off health care and hospitality workers will caravan from around California to the State Capitol today to urge Newsom to sign AB 3216. The bill, now awaiting Newsom’s signature, aims to strengthen worker protections during the Covid-19 pandemic by requiring employers to notify laid-off employees of new, open jobs that they may have qualified for. UNITE Here Local 49, which is organizing the protest, will hold a 4 p.m. press conference.\\n\\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: \"They have this massive valve up north, and as the water comes pouring down from the snow — all beautiful, nice, clean water — they send it out.

And California Lets Them,” by the Desert Sun’s Janet Wilson and ProPublica’s Lylla Younes: “Across some of [California’s] largest oil fields, companies have for decades turned spills into profits, garnering millions of dollars from surface expressions that can foul sensitive habitats and endanger workers. … A close review of the state’s new rules shows they contain several large loopholes that keep oil from surface expressions flowing — the result of years of lobbying and pushback by the energy industry.”\\n\\nMEGHAN’S MOVE — “Gloria Steinem Says She and Meghan Markle Cold-Called U.S. Voters,” by Vanity Fair’s Emily Kirkpatrick: “During her casual conversation with the activist last month, Meghan also expressed her enthusiasm over Kamala Harris\\'s vice-presidential nomination. ‘I’m so excited to see that kind of representation,’ the duchess said at the time. ‘You know, for me, being biracial growing up, whether it was a doll or a person in office, you need to see someone who looks like you in some capacity.’”\\n\\n— “Abolish the Electoral College or award electors on a proportional basis,” Jessica Levinson and Michael A.

Newsom should too,” by the LA Times’ George Skelton: “Baja [California] has a big mountain range that resembles the Sierra Nevada, but it’s healthy and fire-resilient. That’s because until relatively recently, it was managed by nature, not humans — except for Indigenous people who knew what they were doing.”\\n\\n— “Californians moved to Oregon for affordable housing.

A new company would be incorporated in the U.S. and ‘will have nothing to do with China,’ the president said.”\\n\\n— “President Trump calls injured California cops, one of whom can’t speak and wrote out her responses,” by CNN’s Eliott C. McLaughlin.\\n\\nSILICON VALLEY SIGNAL? — “Trump officials rush to make it tougher for skilled foreign workers to gain visas,” by Reuters’ Ted Hesson: “Companies across multiple industries are very concerned about the potential disruption these proposals will inflict upon their operations,” Jon Baselice, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s executive director for immigration policy, said in a statement.”\\n\\nPRESIDENTIAL PURSUIT\\n\\nNEW BIDEN CA CAMPAIGN HEAD — Los Angeles County Democratic Party Chair Mark J. Gonzalez is taking over as California director for the Biden campaign. Gonzalez said in a statement that California sets the standard on issues “from healthcare, to worker’s rights, to Black lives, down to protecting immigrant rights and especially our right to vote” and vowed to work to “make sure Democrats win up and down the ballot here in California” — a reminder that even if Biden is all but certain to scoop up California’s electoral votes, House races are far less certain.\\n\\n— “Biden can thank Californians for his big lead in the money race,” by the LA Times’ Evan Halper and Seema Mehta: “Although Biden’s choice of California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate turbocharged his fundraising, especially in her home state, the president’s actions have been the bigger impetus to donors.”\\n\\nKAMALA’S MOMENT — “Supreme Court fight could elevate Kamala Harris’ profile,” by the AP’s Kathleen Ronayne: “A highly anticipated confirmation hearing would almost certainly change that, giving Harris a massive platform to demonstrate her political skills and articulate the campaign’s message that Ginsburg’s successor shouldn’t be chosen until after the election.”\\n\\nTRUMP\\'S TACTIC — \"Stoking his base, Trump warns of a Kamala Harris presidency,\" by NBC\\'s Sahil Kapur.\\n\\nCAMPAIGN MODE\\n\\nLOS ANGELES DA DASH — Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon has officially joined the stampede of Los Angeles elected officials forsaking incumbent LA District Attorney Jackie Lacey and backing her opponent, progressive challenger George Gascón. In a statement, Rendon said Gascón stands on the right side of history as “the voters and the legislature alike continue to embrace reforms to end California\\'s involvement in a failed war on drugs and the policies of mass incarceration that defined the 1980s and 1990s.”\\n\\nPROP 24 — “California’s Proposition 24 would protect data-privacy law from being weakened in Legislature,” by the SF Chronicle’s Dustin Gardiner: “The Nov. 3 ballot initiative would prohibit legislators from weakening the California Consumer Privacy Act, create a state agency to enforce privacy protections, and give people more control over how tech companies use their personal information, such as race or health data.”\\n\\nSOLAR SPLIT ROLL FIGHT — Supporters of Prop.15, the “split roll” measure on the November ballot, are challenging new ads that argue it would result in “massive taxes” on solar energy projects in California.\\n\\nSchools and Communities First, the educational and labor coalition backing Prop. 15 — which says the ballot measure will raise an estimated $12 billion annually for communities and schools — insisted that the ads and website put out by a coalition of agricultural groups make “blatantly false’’ claims about the measure’s impacts on solar projects. Schools and Communities First noted that earlier this month, Newsom signed SB 364, “which ensures that property tax exclusions for solar developments would be unaffected by Prop. 15.”\\n\\nThe California Business Roundtable’s No on 15 campaign website has argued that the bill is a special interest bailout and is unconstitutional. But Prop. 15 backers say that major solar advocacy groups like the Large Scale Solar Association and the Solar Energy Industries Association now back the measure.\\n\\nA statement via email from the Solar Energy Industries Association: “Our concerns with Proposition 15 have been remedied by the enactment of Senate Bill 364. This bill addresses unintended impacts of Proposition 15 on utility-scale and commercial solar projects and will allow solar development to move forward in California. … .SEIA and its members do not oppose Proposition 15.”\\n\\nMORE ON PROP 15 — “Forty-two years later, another property tax battle,” by CalMatters’ Dan Walters.\\n\\nPOLITICO’S CALIFORNIA BALLOT TRACKER: No state does ballot initiatives quite like California, and interest groups are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to sway voters.

Phil Murphy got less than 24 hours to enjoy the millionaires tax afterglow before the stench of Trenton again splashed on his administration.\\n\\nThe State Commission of Investigation released a scathing report finding that top Murphy administration staffers knew more than they let on about a patronage hiring spree by former Schools Development Authority chief Lizette Delgado-Polanco.\\n\\nRead more from Carly Sitrin.\\n\\nBut here’s some news: There will soon be more allegations of malfeasance about top Murphy administration staffers. This time, it’s coming in the form of an amended lawsuit from Blueprint Capital Advisors, a Black-owned firm overseeing $175 million in state investments, that’s suing the state for racial discrimination, retaliation and theft. It has now hired two attorneys linked to Donald Trump: Jay Sekulow of the conservative Constitutional Litigation and Advocacy Group, who you may remember as the president’s lead defense counsel during impeachment, and Michael J. Bowe of Brown Rudnick.\\n\\n“In my view, it is not just the Division of Investment that has a problem. Broader Trenton has a problem,” Jacob Walthour, Blueprint’s managing principal, said in a phone interview.\\n\\nThe new legal team plans to file an amended complaint within the next couple weeks that will include claims that top Murphy staffers — thus far unnamed — directed retaliatory efforts against the company, as well as other escalations in the case like “double dealing.” It will also likely include defamation claims. This lawsuit\\'s allegations go back to the Christie administration, but they don\\'t stop in January 2018.\\n\\nAnd before you ask, yes, I see the irony of two lawyers who represented Trump, who during Tuesday’s debate would not condemn white supremacists, now working on a racial discrimination case.\\n\\nIn a statement, Walthour said he hired the new lawyers “because they both understand that both racial and economic justice for all Americans is at stake in our case and have the track record to ensure justice is served in this case.”\\n\\nWHERE’S MURPHY? — No public schedule.

South Jersey Democrats will support Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin for re-election, keeping the two legislative leaders in office for another three years. Four Democratic senators from Middlesex — Linda Greenstein (D-Plainsboro), Robert Smith (D-Piscataway), Patrick Diegnan (D-South Plainfield) and Joseph Vitale (D-Woodbridge) — along with Joseph Cryan (D-Union), committed tonight to back Sweeney’s re-election. Twelve Democratic Assembly members from South Jersey will back Coughlin, joining the six-member Bergen County delegation that endorsed the speaker earlier today.\"\\n\\nNOTHING EVER REALLY CHANGES IN TRENTON — “Phil Murphy goes from progressive to Trenton deal-maker. Just look at his budget,” by The Record’s Charles Stile: “For all his self-congratulation over restoring the millionaires tax to 10.75% — a top rate in effect briefly during the stormy reign of Jon S. Corzine, New Jersey\\'s first Goldman Sachs governor — the budget Murphy signed is, in many ways, a replay of the tax-and-spend-and-borrow pattern that has managed New Jersey\\'s fiscal affairs over the past three decades ... the new budget could also serve as a diploma certifying Murphy\\'s graduation into the political academy of Trenton. He met all the course requirements. He cut deals — he agreed to rebates in exchange for votes on the millionaires tax. He strategically doled out the pork— Middlesex and Essex counties are critical for any Democratic candidate for in 2021. And he placated as many constituencies as possible by going on a spending spree. It\\'s a far cry from Murphy\\'s first two years, when Coughlin and Senate President Stephen Sweeney mobilized to teach him a lesson in the transactional norms of the Statehouse.”\\n\\nTHE THIRD-YOUNGEST SENATOR FROM BERGEN COUNTY — “Weinberg says she’ll decide by year’s end whether to seek reelection” by POLITICO’s Matt Friedman: “State Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg, one of New Jersey’s most prominent progressive leaders, said she will decide by the end of the year whether to seek reelection in 2021. ‘As soon as I do [decide], I’ll call my family, my two [Assembly] colleagues, and then I’ll call you,’ the 85-year-old Weinberg (D-Bergen) said in a phone interview Wednesday morning. \\'Certainly, by the end of the year.\\' At this point in her last term, Weinberg had already committed to seeking reelection. There’s been heavy speculation in Bergen County as to whether Weinberg, who’s been in the Legislature for 26 years, will seek reelection.”\\n\\nNURSING HOMES — “Trump administration loosened rules for indoor nursing home visits, but NJ\\'s remain stricter,” by The Record’s Dustin Racioppi: “New Jersey could soon allow more people to visit inside nursing homes again, but operators and family members are growing impatient that the state hasn\\'t loosened its guidelines even after getting approval from the federal government. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued guidelines on Sept. 17 for long-term care facilities to follow for reopening. They include: No new onset of COVID-19 for 14 days, no reported outbreaks at facilities and a limit on the number of visitors. And if the conditions are met, nursing homes ’must facilitate in-person visitation consistent with the regulations,’ the memo said. ‘Failure to facilitate visitation, without adequate reason related to clinical necessity or resident safety, would constitute a potential violation of’ federal regulations, it said ... Over a week after the new federal guidance, advocates are left confused about why the state hasn\\'t given nursing homes the OK to open if they meet the new standards”\\n\\nTWO-THIRDS OF A MASTRO — “Murphy doubles funds for lawyers for ICE detainees,” by WNYC’s Matt Katz: “Immigrants held while awaiting deportation or immigration court proceedings do not have a right to attorneys, like criminal defendants do. While almost all immigrants arrested by ICE in New York get attorneys through a program funded by the city and state, that wasn\\'t the case in New Jersey until Murphy allocated $3.1 million last year. Now, he\\'s doubled that. While that money still covers fewer than half of the hundreds of New Jerseyans detained by ICE, statistics show that immigrants with lawyers are more likely to avoid deportation, so immigrant advocates said the money will keep families together and save the lives of asylum seekers.”\\n\\nPANCADEMIA — New Jersey reports 11 Covid outbreaks linked to in-school transmission, by POLITICO’s Sam Sutton: New Jersey has documented Covid-19 outbreaks linked to in-person instruction at 11 schools, representing a little more than 40 cases, state officials said Wednesday. “Eleven outbreaks with a total of 43 cases three weeks in? Probably as good as we would’ve hoped,” Gov. Phil Murphy said during his regular briefing in Trenton. Neither the schools nor the districts were identified.\\n\\nTHIS TIME THEY’LL BE MORE CAREFUL NOT TO ACCIDENTALLY SEND CHECKS TO SUPER PACS THAT DISCLOSE DONORS — PSEG will again ask BPU for $300 million annual nuclear subsidy, by POLITICO’s Samantha Maldonado: PSEG on Thursday will apply for nearly $1 billion in nuclear subsidies over three years in the second round of awards from the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. The applications for zero-emissions certificates, or ZECs, will be for the second, three-year eligibility period. The state utility regulator last year awarded PSEG’s three nuclear power plants in Salem County $300 million in annual subsidies for the first three-year period. The board’s vote went against the recommendation of BPU staff, who found there was no need for the subsidies, and caused considerable controversy among elected officials and other stakeholders who spoke out against the initial subsidies.\\n\\nPENSIONS — “N.J. public worker pension earnings fell short of goals during the fiscal year,” by NJ Advance Media’s Samantha Marcus: “New Jersey’s pension fund for government workers on Wednesday reported a return of 1.2% in the fiscal year that ended June 30, trailing its policy benchmark and other large public public pension funds … The state assumes the fund will return 7.5 percent on its investments over the long term … Between July 1, 2019 and June 30, the fund returned 1.2%. In the first six months of the calendar year its investments were down 3.54%.”\\n\\nEDUCATION — Why New Jersey’s progressive school funding formula still isn’t working for some children, by POLITICO’s Carly Sitrin: New Jersey’s school funding formula is among the most progressive in the nation, but a new report shows the state’s failure to fully fund it has left a significant equity gap between white and Latinx students — and the coronavirus is threatening to widen it. Gov. Phil Murphy on Tuesday signed into law a $32.7 billion, nine-month spending plan that holds school funding flat and sets the state back in its seven-year commitment to fully fund the formula and achieve equity in spending for all children. That means another year Latinx students will have to make do with less funding than the state says they need, compounded by difficulties wrought by the pandemic, including access to technology and a disproportionate toll the virus has been taking on their families and communities. It will also send the state scrambling for more money next year when New Jersey — which already has one of the worst credit ratings among the states — will be facing an increasingly uncertain fiscal picture.\\n\\n— “These restaurants reopened. That doesn’t mean they’ll survive”\\n\\n— NJ Transit board members demand more say in agency’s budget next year\\n\\n— “Bergen Democrats will back Coughlin for another term as Assembly Speaker”\\n\\n— “Bramnick continues campaign against MVC delays”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTRUMP ERA\\n\\nQUIZNOS IS GONNA HAVE TO CHANGE ITS LOGO SOON — “A member of Congress is facing death threats after QAnon went after him,” by Buzzfeed’s Sarah Mimms: ”Last month, the House Republican campaign committee falsely accused Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski of lobbying to \\'protect sexual predators.\\' On Tuesday, followers of QAnon — a collective delusion that alleges President Donald Trump is fighting a Satanist cabal of elites who abuse children — targeted him, leading to death threats. Malinowski had coauthored a bipartisan resolution last month that would have the House formally condemn QAnon and on Tuesday he was the subject of a ‘Q drop’ — conspiracy-filled, false messages posted to message boards from the self-proclaimed US government insider to their followers … Malinowski received multiple death threats on Tuesday after the Q post went up, he and his office told BuzzFeed News.”\\n\\nTELLING IT LIKE IT WASN’T — Republicans plead with Trump to hit white supremacists harder, by POLITICO’s Nick Niedzwiadek, Marianne LeVine and Burgess Everett: Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, downplayed the alarm many had to the president’s remarks, saying on ABC’s ‘Good Morning America’ that he \"heard it differently.\" Pressed … on the president\\'s ‘stand by’ directive, Christie reiterated that he “didn’t read it that way, but if you want to read it that way that’s your prerogative.\\n\\n$2 MILLION — That\\'s the sum Rep.

New Jersey Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli on Wednesday reported that the positivity rate on new tests taken in the Ocean County township had climbed to 27 percent as of Sept. 26, nine times the statewide spot positivity rate. In addition, she said, 134 of the 722 new cases reported statewide on Wednesday originated in Lakewood, a community of 104,000 whose growth has been fueled by a large Orthodox Jewish community. “Ocean County is our main focus right now,” Gov. Phil Murphy said during his regular briefing in Trenton. While local community leaders, including elected officials, rabbis and other religious leaders have cooperated with the health department, that hasn’t always translated “in the trenches.” “Is it a canary in the coal mine? I don’t know,” he later added. “I hope it isn’t. I hope it is not.”\\n\\n— \"Murphy to visit Ocean County Friday amid scramble to contain Lakewood outbreak\"\\n\\n— “\\'Stay focused\\': Orthodox Jewish leaders ask for caution during holidays as Lakewood COVID-19 cases spike\"\\n\\n— “Did [Lakewood] school mishandle kid’s COVID-19 case?

Former East Orange resident Willis Edwards III, 49, is now facing 31 crimes, which include conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and taking kickbacks in connection with the business of Orange, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito said in a release.”\\n\\nPATERSON FAILS — “Despite funding the purchase of body cameras, Paterson is NJ\\'s only major city without them,” by The Paterson Press’ Joe Malinconico: “Paterson remains the only major New Jersey city where police officers are not equipped with body cameras, according to a recent survey by the state Attorney General\\'s Office. Newark police have 1,123 body cameras, Camden is next with 412, then Elizabeth with 342, Jersey City with 276 and Trenton with 200, as found in a recent survey conducted by the office of Attorney General Gurbir Grewal. The Paterson City Council approved the purchase of 150 body cameras in January, but the Police Department didn’t start training its officers on the devices until September, law enforcement officers said. Paterson won’t begin wearing the cameras while on duty until after the Municipal Law Department and Passaic County Prosecutor’s Office approve policies for their use, officials said.”\\n\\nBARRED MIZPAH — “County criminal investigation closes Mizpah fire co., emergency township meeting,” by The Daily Journal’s Joseph P.

With day one of indoor dining on the books, one of the city’s most vital industries is looking ahead to many more months to come of tight restrictions, nervous diners, and a tenuous chance to recover from the beating they’ve already taken over six months of partial closures.\\n\\nThe state gave the OK for restaurants to open at 25 percent of their normal capacity in the five boroughs, compared to 50 percent in the rest of the state. The reopening, once scheduled for July, had been pushed back out of fears that patrons eating and drinking indoors would fuel the spread of the coronavirus. Indoor dining is going forward for now despite a recent spike in the city’s infection rates, but the upticks add to an atmosphere of uncertainty as the fall progresses.\\n\\nSome restaurant owners proudly threw open the doors to their dining rooms on Wednesday, while others didn’t bother, saying it isn’t worth it financially, or they aren’t confident their customers and employees would feel safe. “It’s not going to be like it was before,” said Edward Vila, the manager of Ecuatoriana in Harlem, who is offering indoor tables but said most of his customers are opting for takeout. Amorina Cucina Rustica owner Ellen Fishman said the Prospect Heights restaurant will stick with popular outdoor seating. “I don’t believe many people would be comfortable with it and I don’t believe my staff would be comfortable,” she said.\\n\\nThe state plans to review Covid-19 numbers and decide whether to increase capacity to 50 percent in November. The city says restaurants can expect inspections to check compliance, which include mandatory temperature checks for diners and a prohibition on bar seating, especially in the Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods where coronavirus clusters are spreading. And count Mayor Bill de Blasio among the diners who aren’t eager to head back indoors. “I personally just prefer outdoor dining, and as long as it’s available I would always choose it,” he said.\\n\\nIT’S THURSDAY.

Andrew Cuomo to say that the city isn’t doing enough to prevent the spread. Six of eight hot-spot areas, in South Brooklyn and Queens, saw an increase in the share of people testing positive for Covid-19, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a press conference Wednesday. The city is also monitoring four additional areas, he said, where the rate of people testing positive for the virus is trending up. Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said the seven-day rate of people who test positive is 1.46%, up from Tuesday. The one-day positivity rate was less than 1% on Wednesday, down from 3.25% on Tuesday, a high that hadn’t been seen since early June. ‘It is so important for everyone to go out and get tested,’ said Mr. de Blasio … Mr. de Blasio said the city would send some 400 police officers and hundreds of other city workers to the affected areas to provide free masks and remind New Yorkers that wearing them is the law.” Wall Street Journal’s Melanie Grayce West and Jimmy Vielkind\\n\\n— The city’s Test and Trace program has fewer than half a dozen Yiddish speakers on staff as city officials struggle to contain the growing coronavirus outbreak in several neighborhoods with large Orthodox Jewish populations in Brooklyn and Queens.\\n\\nLINCOLN RESTLER, a former aide to Mayor Bill de Blasio who got his start in politics taking on the Brooklyn Democratic Party machine, is running for City Council in a crowded primary. Restler registered a campaign account on Tuesday for the eight-way race to replace the term-limited Steve Levin in a district that spans wealthy Brooklyn Heights, hipster havens of Williamsburg and Greenpoint and an Orthodox Jewish area that is instrumental in local elections. He is kicking off his campaign with a proposal to curtail the free-market will of property owners through legislation in the city and Albany that would limit how much rent they could charge for vacant residential and commercial spaces. In doing so, he also took a swipe at de Blasio’s record on affordable housing, saying it resembled that of his political nemesis and predecessor, pro-business Mayor Mike Bloomberg. POLITICO’s Sally Goldenberg\\n\\n“NYPD OFFICERS who don’t wear masks should face ‘penalties,’ Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday — nearly seven months into a pandemic and after months of dodging the issue. ‘Our officers should be held to the same standard as all citizens [in] all public standards,’ de Blasio said during a press conference. ‘If they don’t there should be penalties,’ he added of the governor’s executive order issued in April requiring face-coverings when social distancing isn’t possible. The mayor went on to claim the ‘vast majority are in fact wearing masks’ — while at the same moment, reporters counted at least 18 cops huddled outside the press room at 1 Police Plaza with only three wearing masks. At least 16 more were seen congregated near an elevator bank with none spied wearing masks.” New York Post’s Julia Marsh and Craig McCarthy\\n\\n“THE NEW YORK City Council is set to vote on expelling Bronx lawmaker Andy King from the body on Monday after its ethics watchdog hit the councilman with a new slew of charges, alleging he continued to abuse his staff and stole city funds. The Council posted a notice of a rare Monday meeting, which sources confirmed was to consider removing the misbehaving Democrat from office. Any expulsion vote requires a two-thirds majority in the body, which appears likely as Council Speaker Corey Johnson said Tuesday he would back the move and King appears to have few allies left in the body. The Council’s ethics committee announced Tuesday it had found substantial evidence of misbehavior by King — ending the panel’s third investigation into allegations against the politician who was once best known for wearing bow-ties.” New York Post’s Nolan Hicks\\n\\n“CITIGROUP EXECUTIVE Ray McGuire is turning to one of his closest associates in the business community to guide him on what appears to be a likely run for mayor of New York. McGuire, according to people familiar with the matter, has turned to Charles Phillips, the former CEO of the software company Infor, as an advisor while he seriously considers running for the city’s highest office. Phillips, these people added, has been in on meetings with potential supporters, including those with ties to Wall Street, and others guiding McGuire on his potential run.” CNBC’s Brian Schwartz\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHAT ALBANY\\'S READING\\n\\n“RENSSELAER County officials refused to let a state Health Department inspection team into the county nursing home Wednesday, saying the inspectors wouldn’t provide proof they had tested negative for COVID-19. It is a continuation of a clash between the county and state over access to the nursing home. ‘We just wanted the state to follow the state rules,’ said Richard Crist, the county\\'s director of operations. Crist said the county wanted the group of about seven Health Department employees to either show paperwork that they had tested negative for the virus or to sign a county-provided form attesting that they had tested negative for the disease. The state group departed Van Rensselaer Manor (VRM), the county nursing home, around 10 a.m., according to county officials. Similar scenes played out in July.” Times Union’s Kenneth C. Crowe II\\n\\n“IN AN EFFORT to detect surges of Covid-19 patients earlier, before they arrive at an emergency room, one New York hospital system is turning to web-browsing traffic . Officials for Northwell Health, which operates 23 hospitals, have developed a predictive model that examines more than a dozen data points in millions of page views of its website to determine when physicians might reliably see an uptick in the number of people coming to the hospital and testing positive for Covid-19. Using data from the first six months of the pandemic in New York, officials found that changes in certain areas of web traffic preceded Covid-19 positive diagnoses in the hospital by two weeks.” Wall Street Journal’s Melanie Grayce West\\n\\nTWO DOWNSTATE FOSSIL FUEL PLANTS plants facing tougher emissions limits and eventual extinction are making a longshot promise that they could someday burn hydrogen produced from sun and wind energy. But clean energy groups say the pitch is a mirage — a last-ditch effort by the plants to avoid closure by suggesting they can make the switch from burning fossil fuels to a technology that is, so far, not available for widespread use and would present enormous costs to implement. “It’s so unrealistic that it’s almost laughable,” said Carlos Garcia, with the NYC Environmental Justice Alliance. POLITICO’s Marie J. French\\n\\n\"A BIPARTISAN commission tasked with redrawing New York’s legislative and congressional district lines needs money to begin hiring staff.

But amid a major budget deficit, the agency has not released those funds to the commission, even as the body faces tight deadlines to complete its work next year.

Instead, the Cuomo administration wanted the Board to mail voters just the corrected absentee ballot return envelopes, asking voters to use the ballots they were sent in the first erroneous mailing. On Monday, voters in Brooklyn who opened their absentee ballots found their return envelopes—known as the ‘oath’ envelope because the voter signs it—labeled with the wrong names and addresses. … The suggestion came at a time when mail-in balloting is under intense scrutiny, particularly by President Trump and his supporters.” WNYC’s Brigid Bergin\\n\\n— “The New York City Board of Elections has not submitted a state-mandated report on its staffing needs for this fall, blowing past a September 20 deadline set by Governor Andrew Cuomo and raising concerns about the city’s preparedness for the consequential general election. It is the only jurisdiction in the state to miss the deadline, according to officials at the State Board of Elections, to which the reports are due. The mandate and deadline, set in a late-August executive order, was intended to ensure election administrators were ready for a record number of votes, and ready to count them quickly, including a quantity of mailed-in ballots expected to dwarf what they faced in the chaotic June primaries.” Gotham Gazette’s Ethan Geringer-Sameth\\n\\nTRUMP\\'S NEW YORK\\n\\n“A WAVE OF emotions washed over Jesus Lira when he found out that President Trump has only paid a few hundred dollars in federal income taxes since the early 2000s. ‘It was a little bit of everything — angry, sad, confused,’ said Lira, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico who used to work as a cook at Trump’s Westchester County golf club. ‘The president, my former boss, isn’t paying any taxes. How is that even possible?’ Lira, who’s among dozens of undocumented ex-employees of Trump’s company, was referring to a Sunday report by the New York Times that revealed the president paid just $750 per year in federal income tax in 2016 and 2017 and no income tax at all for 10 out of the previous 15 years. Outraged by the bombshell report, Lira and three other undocumented ex-Trump Organization workers provided the Daily News with records this week showing that they paid tens of thousands of dollars in federal income taxes while working for the president — despite their immigration status.” New York Daily News’ Chris Sommerfeldt\\n\\nFROM THE DELEGATION\\n\\n“SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have pulled out of next week’s New Yorker Festival, the star-studded annual event held by The New Yorker magazine, in solidarity with unionized editorial staff members, who are planning a digital picket line.

TGIF!\\n\\nBAKER\\'S BROAD POWER ON BEACON HILL— Gov. Charlie Baker\\'s influence in Massachusetts government will become even broader by the end of the year. After the unexpected death of Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Ralph Gants, it\\'s likely that Baker will soon be in a position to select the entire bench of the Supreme Judicial Court.\\n\\nThe last governor to appoint the entire court was John Hancock, according to the Boston Globe , who was the first and third governor of the Bay State.\\n\\nBaker has already named five justices to the seven-member court during his time as governor. Baker will fill Gants\\' seat on the court, and another spot on the bench when Justice Barbara Lenk retires later this year. The Governor\\'s Council approves Baker\\'s appointments to the court.\\n\\nNaming the entire SJC would be a long-lasting example of Baker\\'s power as governor, as justices are not required to retire until they are 70. Baker\\'s youngest appointment, Justice Kimberly Budd, will be 70 in 2036.\\n\\nThis comes as the court is deciding whether Baker\\'s other big area of influence — executive orders — are legal. The governor has issued dozens of executive orders to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic, having to do with travel restrictions, facial coverings, flu shots and a host of other issues. Eighty-one percent of Massachusetts residents approve of how Baker has handled coronavirus, according to a poll conducted in June.\\n\\nThe Supreme Judicial Court heard arguments last week in the lawsuit brought by business owners and others. The issue is not whether Baker\\'s decisions were good or bad, but whether he should have relied on the Civil Defense Act for his authority. Justices seemed wary of upending Baker\\'s Covid-19 response, according to CommonWealth Magazine .\\n\\nHave a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

Former gubernatorial candidate Bob Massie is running for the seat, he confirmed to POLITICO. And former candidate for lieutenant governor Mike Lake has been making behind-the-scenes phone calls in preparation for his own run, according to three sources.\\n\\nThe party\\'s next leader will be at the helm when the governor\\'s race comes in 2022, an office Democrats are desperate to win. But the party\\'s 2018 nominee, Jay Gonzalez, only received 33 percent of the vote against popular GOP Gov. Charlie Baker. While the party hasn\\'t been able to put a dent in Baker\\'s popularity, Democrats have been able to pick up seats in the state legislature over the last several years.\\n\\n\"A lot of things have changed over the last four years. It\\'s not the same world, it\\'s not the same America, it\\'s not the same Massachusetts. And I just don\\'t think the party is doing enough to bring new people in and new energy, young people and so forth, but also to meet those challenges,\" Massie told me in a phone call last night. \"As long as the party is still unclear about structures or still battling internal issues, it\\'s going to be harder to beat [Baker].\"\\n\\nMassie said he\\'d spoken to Lake, and during that conversation both men indicated they plan to run for the seat. Lake did not respond to requests for comment yesterday afternoon.\\n\\nFor his part, Bickford said he is \"laser focused\" on electing Democratic nominee Joe Biden on Nov. 3, and pointed to the party\\'s record flipping seats on Beacon Hill. \"I do plan to run for re-election and I welcome any candidate to the race for chair of this great party,\" Bickford said in an email.\\n\\nOne issue likely to come up when the party votes next month is its handling of allegations against Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse by a group of college Democrats, which were later found to be part of an apparent political smear. Bickford retained former state Sen. Cheryl Jacques to investigate what happened, though some party members remain dissatisfied. Lake is among the Massachusetts Democrats who have been vocal about the party\\'s role in the situation and choice of investigator, according to internal emails shared with POLITICO.\\n\\nThe state party will vote for its next chair less than two weeks after the Nov. 3 election. The contest is a runoff, meaning if no candidate wins by over 50% of the vote, the race will go to a second ballot. Bickford won the seat in a 2014 runoff against Suffolk County Sheriff Steve Tompkins and former candidate for lieutenant governor Steve Kerrigan. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the election will be conducted virtually.\\n\\nPROGRAMMING NOTE: Massachusetts Playbook will not publish Monday, Oct. 12.

The last time an incumbent mayor lost in Boston was in 1949. And that was the late Mayor James Michael Curley, who spent part of his term in a federal prison.\\n\\nBoston City Councilor Michelle Wu is running for mayor and hoping to change that trend. Wu announced her campaign yesterday, and addressed Boston\\'s tendency to reelect incumbent mayors during an interview on WBUR.\\n\\n\"We love our history in Boston and the reality as a city that is full of history is we know no one is the first until they do it and it happens,\" Wu said. \"We\\'re actually building a movement here to connect with the real history of Boston, our legacy as a city that has always stood up for what is right, fighting for those systemic big picture changes even when the odds are slim.\"\\n\\nIf Walsh does run for reelection, how Boston handles the coronavirus pandemic over the coming year will be key. Covid-19 has impacted everything — schools, public health, housing and homelessness, transportation and the economy. The mayor is well-liked, and he won reelection with 66 percent of the vote in 2017 against former City Councilor Tito Jackson.\\n\\n\"I want to commend Councilor Wu on her decision. I have great respect for her or anyone who runs for office. I look forward to more conversations about how we can move our city forward,\" Walsh said during a press conference on Tuesday. He passed on a question about whether his administration mishandled Boston\\'s economic boom, as Wu has suggested, and hinted that the mayoral field may grow. \"Whether it\\'s the councilor or anyone else that might decide to think about running for mayor, there will be conversations later on at some point about all that.\"\\n\\nHere\\'s something to watch: Many of Sen. Ed Markey\\'s outspoken supporters from the Sept. 1 primary have shifted their online organizing power to Wu. Making things a little complicated is the fact that Walsh endorsed Markey for reelection against Rep. Joe Kennedy III, while Wu stayed out of the primary.\\n\\nBut don\\'t expect next year\\'s mayoral race to be a repeat of what happened this month. The mood of the electorate changes from year to year, especially with the presidential election looming and the ongoing pandemic, and without a blockbuster statewide primary on the ballot. If the most recent primary followed what happened in 2018, progressive primary challengers like Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse and state legislative candidates Jordan Meehan and Damali Vidot may have won.\\n\\nInstead, incumbents ruled on Sept. 1 — Markey, Rep. Richard Neal and state Reps. Kevin Honan and Dan Ryan, among others, all fended off primary challengers. That\\'s a shift from two years earlier when a slate of progressive Black and Latino candidates — Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins and state Reps. Nika Elugardo and Jon Santiago — upset incumbents or won a tough open-seat primary in 2018.\\n\\nHave a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

She served as director of the Women’s Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union earlier in her career, arguing several cases before the Supreme Court.\\n\\nAnd after joining the high court in 1993 as only the second female justice, she would go on to pen several landmark opinions on gender discrimination, including in the 1996 case United States v. Virginia, which invalidated the Virginia Military Institute’s male-only admission policy.\\n\\nWhen the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that Lilly Ledbetter, an employee at GoodYear Tire, could not sue over sex discrimination because she waited too long to file the complaint, Ginsburg read her searing dissent of the decision from the bench.\\n\\n\"Title VII was meant to govern real-world employment practices, and that world is what the court today ignores,” Ginsburg said in her rebuke, referring to the equal employment clause of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\\n\\nThe case inspired Congress to pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which reset the 180-day statute of limitations with each paycheck.

While Virginia, following Nevada and Illinois, has since approved the amendment, five states have also rescinded their ratification, creating murky legal questions that will likely land before the Supreme Court.\\n\\nIt’s unclear how Ginsburg — who was historically a strong supporter of women’s rights — would have voted on extending the 1982 deadline, but she did say she would have liked for supporters to “start over” with a new ERA, rather than trying to revive the original one.\\n\\n\"I would like to see a new beginning,\" Ginsburg said. “There is too much controversy about latecomers.\"'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/02/census-bureau-count-continue-october-425652', 'Full Text': \"Koh rejected the Bureau’s decision to cut the count off on Oct. 5, writing that the Bureau was disobeying her original order. She said the Census Bureau was “chaotic, dilatory, and incomplete” in following her original injunction, and issued a clarified injunction, directing the Bureau that it must continue its count through Oct. 31, and publicize its efforts to do so, including texting employees on Friday to inform them.\\n\\nOn Friday evening, a release from the Bureau said that it had messaged employees to say the count will go on. “As a result of court orders, the October 5, 2020 target date is not operative, and data collection operations will continue through October 31, 2020,” the message read. “Employees should continue to work diligently and enumerate as many people as possible. Contact your supervisor with any questions.”\\n\\nThe final schedule still remains in flux: The government has appealed Koh’s rulings, but a circuit court rejected a plea for a stay earlier in the week.\\n\\nLike much of American life, the decennial count of every person in the country was thrown into disarray by the pandemic. The Census Bureau initially pleaded with Congress to extend deadlines for the count for 120 days.\\n\\nThe proposed deadlines would have pushed field collection until the end of October, with apportionment data — the population count used for determining the number and population of each state's congressional districts — being submitted to the president by April 30, 2021, instead of by year's end. Congress never granted the extension, and in early August, the Bureau officially announced it was reversing its request for an extension and would deliver apportionment data by the end of the year.\\n\\nThe shortened timeline worried experts both inside and outside the agency, who feared that a politically motivated acceleration could lead to a flawed count that determines billions of dollars of funding and how states are represented in the House of Representatives.

Harris is the first woman of color to be nominated for vice president by one of the major political parties. The daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants would also be the first woman vice president in U.S. history.\\n\\nTrump went after Harris during a rally in Mosinee, Wis., where he hit his usual campaign talking points — from lauding his administration’s tax reform to criticizing his Democratic challengers. His attack on Harris came as he revisited the crowded Democratic primary field of earlier this year, repeating old insults for his former challengers.\\n\\nAttacking Harris has become a major part of the Trump campaign playbook. The president repeatedly characterizes Harris as a California liberal and among the most far-left candidates in the Senate, someone who he says is out of touch with the concerns of everyday Americans. The attacks reflect the Trump campaign’s difficulty leveling similar character attacks against Biden, who Trump has claimed is a puppet of more leftist wings of the Democratic Party.\\n\\nMany of the president’s attacks on his Democratic challengers are exaggerated or flat-out untrue. While Trump has claimed that Harris and Biden want to “defund the police” and turn a blind eye toward looting and rioters amid anti-racist protests that have ballooned over the summer, both of the Democratic candidates have voiced their support for law enforcement and rejected violence in protests.\\n\\nBut that hasn’t tempered his strikes. During his Thursday rally, Trump called Harris a “vicious” candidate, alluding to her clashes with Biden on the debate stage when both were still vying for the Democratic nomination. The two candidates got into heated back-and-forths, particularly on issues related to race.\\n\\nHarris, Trump said, was the candidate “who treated sleepy Joe the worst” — using one of his many mocking nicknames for Biden.\\n\\n“I said brilliantly he will never pick her.

Ron DeSantis answers a question during a roundtable meeting in August. | Joe Burbank/Orlando Sentinel via AP DeSantis loses court pick amid claims of \\'racial tokenism\\'\\n\\nTALLAHASSEE — The Florida Supreme Court blocked Renatha Francis\\' appointment to the state’s high court Friday, ruling her ineligible for the job, and halting Gov. Ron DeSantis‘ pick of the second Black woman to ever serve on the panel.\\n\\nThe decision punctuates a monthslong legal fight infused with racial politics and unusual alliances, and appears likely to force the Republican governor to select a different judge to sit on the court.\\n\\nDeSantis tapped Francis in May to fill one of two vacancies, and he went on to highlight the Palm Beach County judge, a Black woman born in Jamaica, as evidence of his commitment to adding diversity to the court.\\n\\nBut Francis, who would have been the only sitting Black justice, quickly came under scrutiny because she had not been a member of the Florida Bar for 10 years, a requirement in the state constitution. A lawsuit was filed by state Rep. Geraldine Thompson (D-Orlando) challenging the Francis pick, setting up the multi-layered political drama and Friday’s eventual rejection, which admonished the governor over his legal arguments.\\n\\nThe unanimous decision was an unambiguous smackdown of a Republican governor by a court that has been widely hailed as conservative-leaning. Justice John Couriel recused himself from the case. DeSantis sought to sway the justices by arguing that Francis’ pick was an “announcement\" and not a formal appointment, but that logic did not persuade the court.\\n\\n“Either approach leads to the same conclusion: the Governor has not complied with the constitution’s clear commands,” the opinion stated.\\n\\nAdding to the intrigue of the ruling, which poked a huge hole in DeSantis’ legal argument, was who crafted the argument. The ruling was penned by Justice Carlos Muñiz, a DeSantis appointee to the court who is also on President Donald Trump’s shortlist of potential future U.S. Supreme Court picks.\\n\\nThe lawsuit was filed in July, but the political mad scramble did not kick off until after a Tuesday ruling where the court gave DeSantis one day to convince them they should not order him to pick a new justice.\\n\\nDeSantis also held a press conference Wednesday that allied the governor with a handful of Broward County Democrats, the political equivalent of dogs and cats coming together. That included Haiti-born House Democrat Dotie Joseph, who supported Francis becoming the first Caribbean-born justice on the Florida Supreme Court. She tried to assuage the concerns of fellow Democrats by arguing Francis was not cut from the mold of Clarence Thomas, the conservative Black jurist on the U.S. Supreme Court.\\n\\n“My colleagues and I on the Florida Legislative Black Caucus determined that she is not a Clarence Thomas,” Joseph said. “While she may be conservative and a member of the Federalist Society, none of those things in and of themselves disqualify Judge Francis from deserving our support or stamp of approval.”\\n\\n“All skinfolk ain’t kinfolk,” Joseph added of Thomas.\\n\\nOne day later, Thompson hit back, unloading on DeSantis for what she said was a disingenuous effort to paint critics opposed to the Francis pick on constitutional grounds as opposing a Black woman being appointed to the court.\\n\\n“This is one of the worst and most egregious examples of racial tokenism that I have seen in my life,” Thompson told reporters.\\n\\nShe noted that there were six constitutionally qualified black judges who applied for the two vacancies on the Florida Supreme Court, but Francis was the only one forwarded to DeSantis by the Supreme Court Judicial Nominating Commission, which is tasked with recommended a slate of judges the governor must pick from. Only Francis made the final cut.\\n\\n“They could have selected more [black judges],” Thompson told POLITICO on Friday. “They didn’t.”\\n\\nThe court also addressed critics who believe the 10-year bar membership provision in the Florida constitution is arbitrary and should not be a reason to toss a Florida Supreme Court appointee. To underscore that point, they employed the words of a conservative legal icon: the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\\n\\n“To some, enforcing rules like these might seem needlessly formalistic when the result is to preclude the appointment of an otherwise qualified candidate,” the opinion stated. “But ‘formalism,’ as Justice Scalia observed, ‘is what makes a government a government of laws and not of men.’”\\n\\nDeSantis was a member of Congress in 2016 when Scalia died. He took to the House floor to memorialize the legal giant, calling him “one of the all-time greats in American law.”\\n\\nThe court’s Friday ruling went on to needle the Supreme Court Judicial Nominating Commission, the body tasked with crafting a slate of judges for the governor to pick from.\\n\\nIt’s one of the most powerful panels in the state. It is chaired by prominent insurance lobbyist and GOP donor Fred Karlinsky, and includes among its members Daniel Nordby, a former general counsel to Gov. Rick Scott, Jesse Panuccio, who served both in the Scott administration and in the No. 3 post in President Donald Trump’s Justice Department.\\n\\n“The JNC itself made the decisions to nominate a constitutionally ineligible candidate, and it is responsible for the consequences of that decision,” the justice wrote.\\n\\nThe court has given DeSantis until noon on Monday to pick one of the seven other judges on the slate put forward by the commission.\\n\\nNone of the remaining candidates are Black.\\n\\nThe ascendant conservative jurist knee-capping the legal defense of the governor who appointed him sparked a full court press messaging effort from DeSantis and his allies, who sought to amplify the historic nature of putting someone with Francis\\' heritage on the state\\'s highest court.\\n\\n“@GovRonDeSantis came out in support of women, immigrants and Black Florida residents like Jamaican American Judge Renatha Francis who is his pick for the @FlCourts,” tweeted Helen Aguirre Ferré, the Florida GOP executive director who until recently was DeSantis’ communication director, on Wednesday.\\n\\n“[Thompson] Should be ashamed to play politics & deny the FL Supreme Court the only Black female justice,” she added.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2020/10/07/joseph-bruno-longtime-anchor-of-albanys-three-men-in-a-room-dies-at-91-1321865', 'Full Text': 'Former New York Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, left, poses with boxer Shannon Miller of Troy, N.Y., during a news conference in Latham, N.Y., in 2007. | AP Photo/Mike Groll Joseph Bruno, longtime anchor of Albany\\'s \\'three men in a room,\\' dies at 91\\n\\nALBANY, N.Y. — Joseph Bruno, a former boxer who became one of the most powerful men in New York politics and, later, successfully fended off federal corruption charges, died on Tuesday.

The GOP would lose the Senate fewer than five months after he resigned in 2008, beginning a decade of intense power struggles in a chamber that Democrats had traditionally written off.\\n\\nHe became majority leader thanks to a coup launched over Thanksgiving weekend in 1994, weeks after fellow Republican George Pataki ousted Gov. Mario Cuomo, whose son, Andrew, is the state\\'s current governor.\\n\\nFor the better part of 12 years, Pataki, Bruno, and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver comprised Albany’s fabled “Three Men in a Room,” who met behind closed doors to hash out all the major issues facing state government.\\n\\nBruno often sided with Silver, a Democrat, during negotiations, as the two would unite against the governor to fight against proposed spending cuts and for legislative authority. But despite occasionally vitriolic public bickering and budgets that were passed months after they were due, Albany was relatively placid and disputes were settled through bipartisan compromise.\\n\\nThat system began to crumble in 2007. Bruno became the only Republican in a position of power in New York, thanks to the departure of figures like Pataki, who chose not to run for a fourth term in 2006.\\n\\nNew Gov. Eliot Spitzer attempted to steamroll legislators into accepting his positions on issues like campaign finance reform, driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants, and the selection of a state comptroller after scandal drove out an incumbent, Alan Hevesi.\\n\\nBruno held firm against the then-wildly popular governor. When the Spitzer administration tried to pillory him for an alleged misuse of state planes for political purposes, the senator was able to turn the tables by accusing the governor of engaging in seedy surveillance practices. Months of investigations followed, leaving Spitzer too weakened to stand a chance of surviving the more sordid revelations about his personal life that emerged in 2008.\\n\\nBruno left not long after Spitzer\\'s resignation, as he was preparing to deal with looming federal charges involving allegations that he illegally mixed official business with his private interests. He was convicted on two felony charges in 2009.\\n\\nThere was little doubt that there was a blending of his state actions and personal business. But a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision that narrowed the definition of what constitutes improper corruption earned him another trial, and he was eventually found not guilty in 2014.\\n\\nHe always defended Albany’s old way of doing business.\\n\\n\"The funniest line of attack was when the three men were drawn and quartered for the alleged crime of doling out funds to help them and their allies, as if politicians should be above self-interest,” he wrote in his 2016 memoir.\\n\\nThat self-interest has left its mark on the Albany-Troy region he called home.

But he’s also sought support from the U.S. attorney and local special agents with the FBI, DEA and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to talk about tackling crime, especially gun violence and drug trafficking, which remain stubborn issues in Chicago and subject to Trump\\'s public ire.\\n\\nThe Floyd case and his own experiences facing a police officer’s gun have prompted Raoul to push the Chicago Police Department to collect data on all incidents in which an officer points a weapon at a member of the public. That work is part of a federal consent decree established in 2018. “My office held strong on including that requirement in the face of resistance from CPD, and I’m determined to ensure it’s implemented,” he said.\\n\\nRaoul’s experiences growing up on Chicago’s South Side, seeing gun violence outside his front door, navigating Illinois politics and surviving cancer, fuel his ambitions and leave some nerves close to the surface — something that can be seen as a liability.\\n\\n“I’m a guy who wears my emotion on my sleeve,” he said. As a state senator, he was known to tear up during committee debates.\\n\\nThere is a larger question at hand: In a world in which more diverse voices are starting to reshape the corporate world, media, Congress and the criminal justice system, how do those people — let’s be clear, Black and brown people — get elected to these posts? While Black candidates and officials do make successful runs for many state and federal legislative seats, short of Obama’s presidency, it’s exceedingly rare to see one build a coalition that unlocks statewide support.\\n\\n“There is an opportunity to right some of the wrongs of these systems by having more diverse leaders who come from these communities, who give lived experiences about how law enforcement treats people. It’s critical,” said Quentin James, president of The Collective PAC, which promotes African Americans running for local, state and federal offices.

I held Joe accountable for shipping your jobs and dreams abroad and for bowing to the violent mob at home.”\\n\\n“Joe Biden is too weak to lead this country,” he added.\\n\\nThe previous night, Trump spent the bulk of his time interrupting and interjecting as Biden and moderator Chris Wallace spoke. To some Trump aides, the president’s constant haranguing was positive because it allowed him to determine the terms of the debate and deflected attention from any serious policy discussion, including his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\nSeveral others in the Trump orbit thought the president’s persistent interruptions let Biden off the hook and didn’t give the former vice president the chance to potentially make gaffes or policy commitments he might later regret.\\n\\nBut to critics, the president’s performance only highlighted his chaotic style of leadership, which has turned off many independent, suburban and female voters this election year.\\n\\n“We have a white supremacist in the White House who cares only about himself, who says he is about law and order but, I can guarantee you, is coming into my community, disregarding the laws of health and safety for Minnesotans,” Duluth Mayor Emily Larson said ahead of the visit on a call with reporters. “He parses out core information about a coronavirus pandemic at a timeline that he thinks works best for him. I am not about him. I am about this community. I’m about the state, I am about this country, and I am about Joe Biden.”\\n\\nTrump’s campaign advisers, allies and even the president himself have long viewed Minnesota in 2020 as a potential toss-up, thanks to Trump’s support among rural white, noncollege-educated voters.\\n\\nThe last time the state went for a Republican presidential candidate was in 1972, when President Richard Nixon won a second term. Since then, the state has reliably supported Democratic candidates for president, and the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul remain bastions of progressive politics.\\n\\nIn 2016, 19 counties outside of the Twin Cities went for Trump, even though those same counties had supported Barack Obama in prior elections — lending credence to the Trump campaign’s idea of the state as one of the new battlegrounds.\\n\\nRecent polls show Biden up by anywhere from 6 to 16 points in the state. The presidential contest is much closer in other battleground states, such as Florida, North Carolina and Arizona, but the Trump campaign still sees an opening in the northeastern part of Minnesota as the president tries to sway both rural and union workers. Roughly one week ago, Trump held a rally in Bemidji, Minn.\\n\\nDuring the rally on Wednesday, Trump tried to portray himself as an ally of miners and other union workers. Flanking the stage were two long trucks filled with logs and adorned with signs reading “Make Logging Great Again.” Two huge American flags hung from cranes, and Trump spoke about his support for miners and the iron range in Minnesota.\\n\\n\"They closed it up,” the president said. “As vice president, Joe Biden wiped out, he wiped out so much and that includes what he whipped out in the great state of Minnesota and we’re not going to let it happen anymore.”\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally at Duluth International Airport, Wednesday, Sept. 30, 2020, in Duluth, Minn.

But the biggest thing I did was knock out his executive order. I knocked out so many of the things that he did.”\\n\\nThough Trump tried to take credit for saving steelworker jobs, both Obama and Trump took action to protect the steel industry from foreign steel dumping in the state. Obama implemented tariffs on Chinese steel, and most mines that were shuttered during a 2015 downturn reopened before Trump was elected, Minnesota Public Radio reported.\\n\\nThe president spent the first portion of the rally retelling his version of the story in which he triumphed in Tuesday\\'s debate over Biden, whom he sought to cast as a socialist.\\n\\n“I’ve got news for Joe: If you ever became president, you have to deal with some of the toughest people in the world, and Chris Wallace is very, very easy by comparison, I will tell you,” Trump said. “I know them all.”\\n\\n“You know Biden lost badly when his supporters are saying he should cancel the rest of his debates,” he added. “With those ratings, they’re never going to let him cancel. You don’t know television.”\\n\\nBiden\\'s campaign has committed to participating the next debate “under whatever set of rules the Commission develops to try to contain Donald Trump\\'s behavior.” The Commission on Presidential Debates announced on Wednesday that it would be altering the format of the debates to better control the participants.\\n\\nThe rally in Duluth was uncommonly short, clocking just under an hour on stage, and it hit on many of Trump’s popular themes of law and order and his support from law enforcement groups; his recent pick for a Supreme Court seat; and immigration, falsely claiming Biden and Sen.

Pete Wilson has endorsed President Donald Trump. | J. Emilio Flores/Getty Images Pete Wilson endorses Trump, says president has \\'very good judgment\\'\\n\\nOAKLAND — Former California Gov. Pete Wilson joined a list Thursday of prominent former Republican leaders who endorsed Donald Trump for reelection, arguing in an interview that the president has “brought a badly needed realism to American security policy.”\\n\\nWilson was among nearly seven dozen members of past GOP administrations and Congress who backed Trump in a signed letter that was released by the campaign Thursday and tweeted by the president with the words \"THANK YOU! #MAGA.\"\\n\\nTrump “has very good judgment, and very good people around him making honest calls — and alerting him and the rest of the country to the fact that we are facing greater dangers than at any time since Ronald Reagan dealt with the Cold War,’’ Wilson explained to POLITICO Thursday.\\n\\nThe former Republican governor is often blamed for the state party\\'s woes among voters, especially now that Latino residents comprise a plurality of California\\'s population. While running for reelection in 1994, Wilson championed Proposition 187, then billed as a way to stop undocumented immigrants from accessing public services. Voters approved the initiative but it was blocked by courts — and is now a far cry from subsequent state policies enacted by Democratic leaders.\\n\\nDespite Wilson\\'s legacy on immigration, he was often considered a social moderate in the latter 20th century, supporting abortion rights. And he positioned himself as a moderate Republican during his 1996 run for president — a tack different from Trump\\'s appeal to the party\\'s conservative base.\\n\\nWilson\\'s endorsement veers from positions taken by past prominent members of the California Republican establishment. Among them: 2010 gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman; 2010 U.S. Senate candidate Carly Fiorina; and high-level strategist Steve Schmidt, who advised President George W. Bush, former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and 2008 GOP presidential nominee John McCain.\\n\\n“I like many of these people, and they are personal friends ... and I\\'ve talked to enough of them to know that they don\\'t like his style,’’ Wilson said. But he advises them to “look at performance — look at what he’s actually achieved.’’\\n\\nA former Marine, Wilson lauded Trump for his strong stand in support of Israel, and for his key role in the so-called Abraham Accords, the recently signed normalization agreement between Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which he called historic.\\n\\nRegarding threats to American security, including from countries like Iran and China, Wilson said Trump “has been tough as hell with them in terms of the actual policies that he has put in place.\"\\n\\nWilson also defended Trump’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, saying that if the president “had not as early as he did in late January’’ shut down flights from China, “it would have been a far worse situation ... and I don\\'t see how anybody can deny that.”\\n\\nMike Madrid, a Republican consultant who has worked with Wilson for years and counts him as a friend, said he was shocked by the former governor’s stance. Along with Schmidt and other prominent Republicans, Madrid is a founder of the Lincoln Project, a group of GOP strategists raising money and running ads against Trump.\\n\\n“Gov. Wilson has always been very good to me. He helped me to get started in politics,\" Madrid said. \"But we’re at a moment where what is happening to this country is undeniable, and for the first time in my life — as someone who is Latino, who knows him personally and has admired him — I will say I’m disappointed in him.\"\\n\\nWilson \"is a fighter, a man of principle and he comes to his own opinions and always viewed as a leader ... but he just made Joe Biden’s Latino outreach effort a helluva lot easier,\" Madrid added.\\n\\nOther Californians who joined Wilson on the list include Ric Grenell, the Fox News pundit who is Trump’s former ambassador to Germany and his former acting director of national security, and Edwin Meese, the former Alameda County district attorney who served as attorney general under President Ronald Reagan.\\n\\nThe letter backing Trump from 66 former GOP leaders comes less than a week after the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden released a letter announcing his endorsement by more than 500 national security experts. That letter, titled \"Our Fellow Citizens,\" was signed by 22 four-star officers, and charged that the “current president” is not up to “the enormous responsibilities of his office.\"\\n\\nMore than 70 top Republicans, who are national security officials, have also issued a letter calling Trump “dangerously unfit to serve.” Among those signing the letter were former Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel; former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden; former Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte, and former CIA and FBI director William Webster.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2020/09/23/what-stds-can-tell-us-about-how-to-fight-covid-420720', 'Full Text': 'But the cycles of infection we’re watching with Covid are similar to patterns we’ve long seen in diseases like HIV and tuberculosis, where a successful suppression of infection rates is followed by funding cuts and the abandonment of vulnerable communities, allowing viruses and bacteria to make a comeback.\\n\\nSexual health experts say the lessons they’ve learned from both these triumphs and failures could make a major difference now in suppressing the coronavirus. Their insights suggest smart ways forward that might well cross party lines — including that you can\\'t fix a problem just with finger-wagging and new rules, but you can\\'t wish it away and move on with your life, either.\\n\\nHere are the top lessons they’ve learned that could help battle the Covid-19 pandemic:\\n\\n1. From condoms to masks, fear and shame don\\'t work.\\n\\nSexual health experts who have spent decades promoting condom use have some advice for their public health counterparts struggling to convince people to wear face masks: attempts to scare or shame people into compliance will backfire.\\n\\n“When we tell people: ‘If you don’t like wearing a mask, you’re really not going to like a ventilator’ — those kinds of fear-based messages are not very effective,” said Julia Marcus, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School who specializes in HIV prevention. “Even if there’s truth to them, they make people associate this simple intervention with sickness and death. Similarly, messages that have associated condoms with disease and death didn’t exactly make people hot to put them on in a moment of pleasure and intimacy.”\\n\\nMarcus says officials should be aware that resistance to wearing condoms and resistance to wearing masks are driven by some of the same misperceptions about their effectiveness and insecurities about manliness. But there are ways to get around them. She pointed to videos produced by California’s health department that acknowledge and address head on some of the reasons people don’t wear masks — from concerns it telegraphs weakness to small annoyances like fogging up glasses and making it harder to read facial expressions — as an example of a more effective strategy.\\n\\nExperts say mask campaigns should also emulate successful HIV prevention campaigns that appealed to people’s altruism, like one popular message developed a few years ago pushing HIV-positive people to adhere to their drug regimen to protect both themselves and their sexual partners.\\n\\nAs with condoms and HIV drugs, the most effective message is that masks don’t just protect us; they protect others. And that’s not getting across.\\n\\n“It’s the notion that … you\\'re doing good for your fellow person and your community,” said Perry Halkitis, dean of the Rutgers School of Public Health. “That\\'s completely lacking in the [mask] messaging right now.”\\n\\n2. Abstinence is a fool’s errand.\\n\\nResearchers who have watched decades of abstinence-only education fail to bring down the number of unintended pregnancies and STDs say the government should not counsel the Covid equivalent of abstinence — strict quarantines and social isolation.\\n\\n“You need to give people safe ways to navigate the pandemic just like you need to give people safe ways to have sex,” Halkitis said. “If you don\\'t, people are going to develop mythological understandings of how biology operates so they can accommodate their needs and their desires.”\\n\\nNot everybody can work remotely, many lack space in the home to keep separate from other family members, and long-term isolation can be emotionally crippling. So Halkitis and other STD experts say the government should instead adopt a “harm reduction” approach — one that helps people understand the spectrum of risk of different activities so they can make informed decisions. For instance: If you can stay home, stay home. If you can’t, stay six feet apart and wear a mask. Outdoors is safer than indoors. Small groups are better than large ones.\\n\\nBut so far, there’s been more of a black-and-white, all-or-nothing approach — reflected in language used by both Democrats and Republicans like “shutdown,” “lockdown” and “reopening” that doesn’t convey nuance. Jeanne Marrazzo, a physician and HIV and infectious diseases expert at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said a more empathetic and supportive approach from officials — i.e. “How can I help you stay safe?” — works better than a punitive tone that often leads to people doubling down on risky behavior.\\n\\n“This approach of vilifying people who violate the rules has never worked,” she said. “It’s never worked for HIV or STDs or drug use, and it’s not working now for people having frat parties on college campuses.”\\n\\n3. Testing needs to be free, convenient and routine or it will fail.\\n\\nThe U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic has been plagued by testing failures — from supply shortages to surprise medical bills to a dangerously inadequate effort to test those without symptoms — that have allowed the virus to spread far and wide.\\n\\nThese missteps could have been avoided, public health experts say, if the government had ensured from the beginning that testing was universally free, convenient and routine, and that it covered people regardless of whether they have symptoms.\\n\\n“We realized way back in the 1960s and 70s that many, if not most, people [with STDs] were asymptomatic and to get ahead of the curve you had to find the people who had the highest risk and were most likely to transmit it,” said Cornelis Rietmeijer, the former head of Denver’s STD control program. “You have to do screening, not just diagnostic testing.”\\n\\nRietmeijer cited the hard-won battle that led to the CDC recommending in 2014 that all sexually active women under 25 be screened every year for chlamydia as an example of the kind of broad based strategy that works; STDs that don’t have the same level of routine testing, like syphilis, have seen epidemics.\\n\\n“One of the things happening in the U.S. that’s a disaster is the increase in congenital syphilis,” he said, referring to an STD passed from a pregnant mother to her child. \"That’s something you usually only see in the third world. It\\'s totally preventable if women get tested in their first trimester.”\\n\\nOther successful strategies include using mobile vans to bring testing to vulnerable neighborhoods and providing at-home testing kits — some of which allow people to swab themselves and mail the sample into a lab and others that deliver rapid results at home. Similar mail-in tests for Covid are becoming more available, and testing companies are trying to develop simple, instant at-home tests, like pregnancy tests. But while there are open questions about their accuracy, experts say the government should more aggressively pursue, perfect and promote this option.\\n\\n\"Some people experience discomfort in clinical settings, while others say they just don’t know where to go to get tested,\" said Jen Hecht with the group Building Healthy Online Communities, which has researched how at-home HIV testing kits can expand access. “And at home, there’s no need to deal with anything related to transportation or taking time off work.”\\n\\n4. Build trust with marginalized populations.\\n\\nLike STDs, Covid has been far more prevalent among marginalized groups, including communities of color and the poor, who because of centuries of abuse and neglect by the medical system are often reluctant to come in for regular testing and treatment of infectious diseases — one reason they have disproportionate rates of both STDs and Covid-19.\\n\\nAdvocates and government officials have made some progress on tackling sexual health disparities by pushing local health departments to recruit and hire disease investigators who are from the communities they’re trying to reach, and to create messaging specifically tailored to minority groups — two actions they say aren’t happening enough during the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\nIn Arkansas, for example, immigrants from the Marshall Islands comprised nearly 20 percent of Covid-19 cases in two hard-hit counties although they made up only 1.5 percent of the population, according to a CDC team that flew in to investigate this summer. At the time, the state had only one contact tracer who spoke Marshallese, out of a team of 200, and its public health phone alerts were not available in that language.\\n\\nBut STD experts have learned that hiring bilingual public health workers and translating guidance isn’t enough. To build trust, it’s essential to have staff who have backgrounds that reflect the communities at highest risk of infection — such as LGBT people, immigrants, the formerly homeless and those recovering from addiction.\\n\\nMarrazzo said she fears inadequate consultation with marginalized groups in the development of a Covid-19 vaccine will mean that the people who need it most won’t trust or take it if and when it becomes available. A poll conducted in late August found that 72 percent of Black Americans said they would not get a coronavirus vaccine when it’s available, compared to 49 percent of white respondents.\\n\\n“The only way you’re going to get something that works for people is to involve them in the research from the beginning,” she said. “We learned that the hard way with sexual health and we’re making the same mistakes again now.”\\n\\n5. Don’t stop something that’s working.\\n\\nThe U.S. has long been trapped in a dangerous cycle of ignoring and defunding public health programs during times of calm and only to throw money at a problem later when it becomes a crisis.\\n\\n“It happened with tuberculosis in the 1960s and 70s,” recounted Rietmeijer. “When TB came under control, they dismantled all the clinics in New York City. Then it increased again and we were all caught with our pants down.”\\n\\nMore recently, states and the federal government invested heavily in global health and infectious disease prevention after 9/11 drew attention to bioterrorism threats, but that funding was gutted in the wake of the 2008 recession. It never recovered, allowing STD rates to soar and leaving the nation highly vulnerable to the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\n“The lesson is that prevention works, but what tends to get defunded is prevention,” Halkitis said. “Putting the money in the front end, while costly, is going to save money in the long run. But we as a country totally suck at that.”\\n\\nLeaders like former CDC Director Tom Frieden are lobbying for a permanent health security fund that operates outside of Congress’ normal budgetary dealings, so that funding isn’t approved only when a pandemic or other crisis is already underway.\\n\\nAs Covid-19 deaths level off at the still-high rate of around 1,000 per day, experts stress that it’s not too late to implement these strategies from the sexual health world and turn the tide of the pandemic. The real danger, they say, is to continue on the current path.\\n\\n“People say public health has failed on sexually transmitted infections,” Rietmeijer said, citing the country’s current record rates of gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia. “But I say, society has failed public health. We’ve let it go by the wayside. There\\'s been complacency when there is no urgency.”\\n\\nThis story is part of a reporting fellowship on health care performance sponsored by the Association of Health Care Journalists and supported by the Commonwealth Fund.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/07/vp-debate-2020-what-to-watch-427305', 'Full Text': 'POLITICO Dispatch: October 8 Plexiglass barriers. 12 feet between the candidates.

Disinterested viewers could flip the channel to baseball without worrying a bomb was about to go off.\\n\\nIf you think that’s not consequential, consider the despair that moderator Chris Wallace, the Commission on Presidential Debates and political professionals everywhere were thrust into following the debate between Trump and Joe Biden last week.

To Harris, it is \"the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country.” To Pence, it was an early intervention that saved lives.\\n\\nThe lines weren’t new. But the debate served as a reminder that the virus isn’t going anywhere in the final month of the campaign — and Pence seems to know it. Instead of dodging on the virus, he punched back, asserting that the administration will have a vaccine in “record time” and accusing Harris of working to “undermine public confidence in a vaccine.”\\n\\n“Stop playing politics with people’s lives,” he said.\\n\\nThe problem for Pence is that the weight of public opinion is against him. More than 200,000 Americans have died from Covid-19. The pandemic is raging, with the president — himself infected — leaving the hospital only Monday. The White House has become a hot spot of infection. And if that wasn’t enough, Trump on Tuesday pulled out of negotiations with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) over a pandemic relief package, deflating financial markets on his first day back.\\n\\nIf the in-person audience needed a reminder, the situation is so grave in Salt Lake City that debate coverage in the local newspaper this morning shared above-the-fold real estate with a story about the mayor urging reinstatement of some public health restrictions.\\n\\nPence the defender\\n\\nPence is better at this than Trump.\\n\\nWhereas the president failed last week to make the debate about anything other than him, Pence knows how to pivot. And he did.\\n\\nAsked if he believes climate change is an “existential threat,” Pence turned to taxes, criticizing Biden for proposing to cancel Trump-era tax cuts. He hit Harris and Biden on fracking and fossil fuels, saying a Biden administration would “crush” American jobs.\\n\\nHe accused Harris of being unacceptably liberal.\\n\\nNone of this may work, of course. This election is overwhelmingly a referendum on Trump, and the president is lagging badly for a reason. But Republicans will be a lot happier leaving a debate in which the focus wasn’t so lopsidedly on the president.\\n\\nWhat Trump needed from Pence on Wednesday is what he got — a calm explanation to Republicans and right-leaning independents that a Trump-Pence ticket, however chaotic, also comes with the conservative policies they care about.\\n\\nPence resets debate with a focus on the Supreme Court\\n\\nJudge Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump\\'s pick to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg\\'s seat on the Supreme Court. | Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post via AP\\n\\nThe best thing Pence did for Republicans on Wednesday night was to refocus attention on the Supreme Court — and pummel Harris for refusing to say if she and Biden will support expanding the court if Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed.\\n\\nThis was no easy task. Trump’s hospitalization — and the infections of Republicans around him — had turned the public attention on Barrett’s nomination away from the court and to an epidemiological study of the Rose Garden event that kicked it off.\\n\\nBut Pence pushed past that.\\n\\n“I think the American people really deserve an answer,” he said. When Harris repeatedly dodged, Pence spoke directly to the camera, saying, “The straight answer is they are going to pack the Supreme Court if they somehow win this election.”\\n\\nRepublicans believe highlighting Barrett could energize base voters and persuade conservative-leaning independents to get over their reservations about Trump’s temperament or other aspects of his job performance.\\n\\nOn the line is a case to undercut the Affordable Care Act that the Supreme Court will hear one week after Election Day, as well as the composition of a court that may be called on to settle election-related disputes.\\n\\nHarris criticized Pence for the administration’s efforts to undo health care protections and on Democrats’ concerns about what Barrett’s confirmation could mean for Roe v. Wade. But what will be remembered from the Supreme Court conversation is the Biden-Harris ticket’s unwillingness to answer on a Supreme Court expansion.\\n\\nHarris is tightly scripted in big moments\\n\\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris. | Michael A. McCoy/Getty Images\\n\\nIt was bad enough when Trump refused to condemn white supremacists last week, instead telling the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by.”\\n\\nIt was devastating for the Trump-Pence ticket watching Harris remind the country of it.\\n\\nThis wasn’t Trump, Biden or Chris Wallace — three other white, male septuagenarians — on stage with the Pence. It was Harris who, if elected, will be the first Black vice president.\\n\\nHarris was on and off during the debate, and Pence edged in more often than she did. But Harris was effective on the coronavirus and powerful on race.\\n\\nThe former prosecutor said she would “not be lectured to” by Pence about issues of law and order and criminal justice. She and Pence were talking, she said, about a president, during last week’s debate, “refused to condemn white supremacists.”\\n\\nPence shook his head and said, “Not true.” But it was. Millions of Americans saw it for themselves.\\n\\nHarris got in trouble in the primary when she went off script — or didn’t have one.\\n\\nBack in 2018, she said “it depends,” when asked at a town hall meeting if she would reject donations from corporations or corporate lobbyists, then changed course within weeks and electing not to take corporate PAC money. During the primary, she struggled to express how, exactly, she planned to address health care — with the Biden campaign dismissing the proposal she came up with as a “have-it-every-which-way” plan.\\n\\nBut Harris’ plans are now Biden’s. And when Harris is prepared — as her performance in the debate demonstrated — she can be very good.\\n\\nLife — and death — is a stage\\n\\nProtective plastic panels stand onstage between tables for Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris at the University of Utah on Tuesday in Salt Lake City. | Patrick Semansky/AP Photo\\n\\nIf the first 15 minutes of a debate are the most important, the opening scene on Wednesday wasn’t good for the Trump-Pence ticket.\\n\\nSusan Page, the moderator, described the “extra precautions” taken to avoid spreading the coronavirus, including plexiglass separating the two candidates, clear reminder to viewers of the Trump administration’s inability to control the coronavirus pandemic, even inside the White House.\\n\\nOf course, that was a round Harris won before the debate even started. Pence had objected to such a barrier before caving, and it was a gross miscalculation. The controversy generated a flurry of coverage, and the barriers when up, anyway.\\n\\nIt’s not a conversation the Trump-Pence ticket wants to have. And if Pence — who has so far tested negative for Covid-19 — couldn’t stop organizers from putting stricter public health measures in place, it’s hard to see how Trump, who just left the hospital with the virus, will be able to do any better if either of the two remaining presidential debates go forward.\\n\\nPence affixes himself to Trump\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrive at a campaign rally in Sept. 2020 in Newport News, Va. | Steve Helber/AP Photo\\n\\nHistory suggests Wednesday’s vice presidential debate almost certainly won’t affect the outcome of this election. But it might have offered a preview of the next one.\\n\\nPence put zero daylight between himself and the president. He evaded a question about Trump’s refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, saying he would have confidence in the outcome if it is “free and fair.” He said support for Trump had only grown in four years, that the media unfairly “selectively edit” the president, and that he “couldn’t be more proud” to stand with Trump.\\n\\nIt might not matter. Trump still has a grasp on the Republican Party, and the attachment may serve Pence well. Sure, he can be boring. But who knows what Republicans will be in the mood for personality-wise in four years. Pence’s approval ratings among Republicans are solid, and he has support among Christian conservatives.\\n\\nBut if Trump loses big, Pence may have a trouble. In past appearances, he has at least nodded to some differences with the president, saying at the Republican National Convention this summer, for example, that Trump “does things his own way, on his own terms.”\\n\\nPence produced nothing on Wednesday that he will be able to point back to four years from now as evidence of at least some separation.\\n\\nAnd it is possible that Pence and Harris will be sharing a stage once again.

But that tune is changing after Kamala Harris, Biden’s running mate, made a stop in Miami last week and Biden chose Kissimmee for his first in-person campaign appearance.\\n\\nIn Kissimmee, a city outside Orlando and the epicenter of the state’s Puerto Rican vote, Biden planned to outline a wide-ranging plan to help Puerto Rico, an island battered in recent years by natural disasters and economic instability.\\n\\nHe wants to make it easier for Puerto Rico to get federal assistance after years of fighting with the Trump administration for help in the wake of devastating natural disasters, boost payments to the island’s Medicare Advantage System and expand coronavirus services.\\n\\nBiden has not endorsed statehood, which is among the biggest issues for Puerto Rican voters.\\n\\n“They have woken up and smelled the café con leche,” said state Sen. Annette Taddeo, a Miami Democrat and persistent critic of her party’s Hispanic outreach. “It’s absolutely not too late. I’ve been happy they are taking note.”\\n\\nFor years, the political fight for Florida’s Hispanic vote has centered on South Florida, home to huge patchwork of Hispanic voters, including conservative-leaning Cubans, Venezuelans and Nicaraguans. That focus is starting to shift to Central Florida, where more than 1 million Democratic-leaning Puerto Ricans have become a powerful voting block that has helped offset conservative Cuban voters. Florida’s complex Hispanic electorate now makes up 17 percent of all registered voters.\\n\\n“We are going to have a full-court press in the Central Florida region,” Biden campaign adviser Christian Ulvert said. “The Puerto Rican vote is critical, and the campaign is going to work hard to earn every one of their votes.”\\n\\nFollowing Biden’s appearance Tuesday, big-name surrogates are expected to blanket the Orlando media market, a large and critical portion of the coveted Interstate 4 corridor, in the weeks leading up to Election Day.\\n\\n“Nothing is perfect, there are always bumps in the road, and we are starting to straighten them out. Is everyone happy? No,” said state Sen. Victor Torres, who is of Puerto Rican descent and represents an Orlando-area seat. “But we are getting there. It is getting worked out and they are trying to make it correct.”\\n\\nBiden’s late-hour attempt to reverse public perception of his Hispanic outreach comes amid a withering drumbeat of criticism from the Trump campaign and Florida Republicans, who are casting Democrats and Biden as socialist-sympathizing extremists who support leftist Latin American strongmen.\\n\\n“Joe Biden is a wholly owned subsidiary of the radical left socialist agenda,” said Florida Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez, a prominent Trump campaign Hispanic surrogate, on a campaign call Tuesday afternoon. “Biden would strengthen Cuba’s brutal regime, which would make it easier to prop up other regimes” such as Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela.\\n\\nBiden almost certainly will win the Hispanic vote in Florida, but in a state where the past two presidential elections have been decided by less than a single point, margins matter.\\n\\nA poll earlier this month found Biden’s advantage among Hispanic voters at 53-37, much smaller than the 27-point margin Hillary Clinton claimed in 2016 when she narrowly lost Florida to Trump.\\n\\nSteve Schale, a Democratic consultant who runs Unite the Country, a pro-Biden super PAC, doubts that Biden can replicate Clinton’s margins in Hispanic-heavy Miami-Dade County, but Biden might not have to reach Clinton-level numbers to win the state.\\n\\nThe Clintons had 30 years of relationship-building in Miami and Bill Clinton was one of the first Democrats to actively campaign for the Cuban vote, Schale wrote in a memo outlining Florida’s 2020 landscape. “Republicans and Trump have had four years of outreach work.”\\n\\nTrump is unlikely to replicate his massive wins with white older and suburban voters, so Biden won’t have to win the same share of the Hispanic vote as Clinton did in 2016, Schale wrote.\\n\\nTaddeo, who as recently as last week was critical of Biden’s Hispanic outreach, said the campaign has woken up just in time to a potential trap that could once again cost the party Florida’s 29 electoral votes.\\n\\nBiden’s visit on Tuesday builds on excitement over a $100 million ad pledge from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a portion of which will target Hispanic voters throughout the state. Detailed plans for the commitment have been kept under wraps, but the ad campaign will focus on Hispanic turnout.\\n\\n“The café con leche is getting whipped cream on top with the millions that Bloomberg will spend specifically on Hispanic voters,” Taddeo said in an interview as she drove to do Spanish-language audio work for the Bloomberg effort.\\n\\n“My understanding is that it will be spent on ground and digital,” said a person familiar with early planning for the nine-figure spend. “Bloomberg people are very data-driven. No one will receive money without proof of ability to perform.”\\n\\nBloomberg’s money will bolster Biden’s paid media advantage in the Miami market and Spanish-language ads across the state. Biden so far has spent $11 million in the Miami market and $1.7 million on Spanish-language ads.\\n\\nTrump has spent $10.9 million in Miami and $800,170 on Spanish-language ads, according to Advertising Analytics.\\n\\nStill, Biden needs to overcome a multiyear effort by Florida Republicans to brand Democrats as extremist socialists, messaging that has been given a signal boost by the Trump campaign.\\n\\nState Rep. Javier Fernández of South Miami, a Democrat running in a competitive Florida Senate seat, said the branding effort has been under way for years. The GOP-dominated Florida Legislature, for example, in 2019 passed legislation to ban sanctuary cities despite the fact that no Florida municipalities have laws protecting illegal immigrants from federal law enforcement.\\n\\n“The consistency and message discipline have long been there. That’s what has made it effective,” Fernandez said. “In Tallahassee, [the Republican majority] have chosen issues to highlight extremism and rule of law. Sanctuary cities are a good example of one of those calculated wedge issues.”\\n\\n“Joe Biden is not a Trojan horse for the liberal left, which is a growing sub-narrative,” he said. “He is going to act within his own belief system.”\"}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/21/trump-white-voters-support-418420', 'Full Text': 'POLITICO Dispatch: September 21 Just a handful of states could decide who becomes the next president. POLITICO reporters from across the country break down what it will take for Donald Trump and Joe Biden to win over the most critical voters.\\n\\nIn 2016, white voters cast over 80 percent of the vote in each of the three states, according to exit polls.\\n\\n“It’s a big, big swing,” said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. “What [Biden’s] doing among whites is more than offsetting the slippage among nonwhites … The recipe is very different this time, right now anyway, in terms of white voters.”\\n\\nIt’s possible the focus on Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s replacement will help Trump, reminding voters who have drifted away from him what they cared about in 2016. Four years ago, one in five voters — many of them white, social conservatives — said Supreme Court appointments were the most important factor in their vote.\\n\\nBut Trump is working from a disadvantage this year. There are relatively few undecided voters left to persuade. Democrats are also highly energized about the Supreme Court. And Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the court one month before the midterm elections two year ago did nothing to stop Democrats from steamrolling Trump and the GOP.\\n\\nThe erosion of Trump’s white support — and its significance to the November outcome — was never more obvious than in Trump’s messaging in recent days. Last week, he called for the creation of a commission to promote “patriotic education,” while dismissing “critical race theory” and the 1619 project of The New York Times Magazine. At a rally in Mosinee, Wis., he lit into Kamala Harris — the first major party woman of color vice presidential nominee — lamenting the possibility of her becoming president “through the back door.”\\n\\nOn Friday, he released a TV ad in Minnesota and Michigan lashing into Biden for supporting increased refugee admissions, including from “the most unstable, vulnerable, dangerous parts of the world.” Then, before an overwhelmingly white crowd in Bemidji, Minn., Trump mocked Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) — the first Somali-American in Congress and a former refugee — and said Biden would “turn Minnesota into a refugee camp.”\\n\\nHe praised Minnesotans for their “good genes.”\\n\\nBut Trump’s rhetoric does not appear to be resonating with white America to the degree it did in 2016. That year, whites cast nearly three-quarters of the vote nationally, and Trump won those voters by about 15 percentage points, according to Pew Research. Four years later, Biden has torn into that advantage, though to what degree is uncertain. The latest Morning Consult poll showed Trump now beating Biden among white likely voters nationally by just 5 percentage points. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll on Sunday put Trump up among white voters by 9 percentage points, while a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll on Friday showed Biden and Trump essentially tied with white voters.\\n\\nAnywhere in that range is a problem for Trump. It is a major reason why Biden, despite underperforming with voters of color, is still running ahead nationally.\\n\\n“Suburban whites are pretty much gone” for Trump, said Ed Rendell, the former Pennsylvania governor and former chair of the Democratic National Committee. And Biden is far less objectionable to many working-class whites than Clinton, a more polarizing nominee whose favorability ratings were lower than Biden’s.\\n\\n“If Trump loses Pennsylvania by 4 or 5 points,” Rendell said, “then the suburbs and the working-class whites, that accounts for the loss.”\\n\\nTrump is doing better with whites in some states than others. In North Carolina, he is drawing noncollege-educated white voters at about the same levels he was in 2016. But in other states, including some with sizable populations of people of color, he is underperforming with whites. In Florida, Trump is running ahead of Biden with white voters 56 percent to 39 percent, according to a Monmouth University poll. But that is far short of the 32 percentage-point margin he posted in 2016. In Arizona, he has seen his 14-point edge with white voters in 2016 cut as well.\\n\\nIt wasn’t always clear Trump would have any problem with white voters — or that he would be making gains with people of color. Even in the midterm elections, when suburbanites recoiled from Trump and Democrats retook the House, Republicans carried the white vote nationally by about 10 percentage points.\\n\\nBut white voters have not proved immune to the damage inflicted on Trump by the coronavirus and its resulting economic wreckage, which have been a drag on Trump’s reelection campaign since spring. In particular, the pandemic appears to have hurt Trump with seniors, including older white voters concerned about both their retirement accounts and their health.\\n\\n“It’s these older white voters that I think are the ones that are moving” away from Trump, said Jeff Link, a veteran Iowa-based Democratic strategist who has studied voters who turned from Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016. “The older people are like, ‘What the f--- is this guy doing?\\'”\\n\\nEarlier this year, Trump appeared to have an opening to recapture white support. Following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis — and the ensuing protests across the country — Trump pivoted to a law-and-order campaign, with overt appeals to suburban whites. But the effort has largely fallen flat, with numerous polls suggesting the turmoil was doing little to improve Trump’s prospects.\\n\\nAnd the issue that motivated many white voters in 2016 — immigration, amplified by Trump’s promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border — has all but fallen out of view. During his successful presidential campaign, 13 percent of voters ranked immigration as the most important issue facing the country. Last month, immigration barely registered at 2 percent in Gallup’s survey of the most important problems facing the country.\\n\\nPat McCrory, the former Republican governor of North Carolina, said he has been “very surprised” that the Trump campaign has not leaned more heavily into immigration, particularly around Biden’s past statements about health care for undocumented immigrants.\\n\\nBut with the coronavirus and months of civil unrest on the electorate’s mind, “the two moving factors [in the election] may be the violence and the virus: The two V’s. Both parties are throwing ads and mail out on those two issues.” McCrory said, “There does seem to be a little flip” between Biden and Trump, with Biden courting working-class whites and Trump “actually trying to go after the Black vote, and the Hispanic vote.”\\n\\nAppearing at a town hall last week in his childhood home of Scranton, Pa., a city that is more than 80 percent white, Biden cited his “Scranton roots” in an appeal to the working class, saying he was accustomed to people deriding those “who look at us and think that we\\'re suckers, look at us and they think that we don\\'t — we\\'re not equivalent to them.”\\n\\nNot only do public safety-based appeals appear to be faltering for Trump, white voters “still really care about pocketbook issues, and that is the underlying issue that drives their vote,” said Zak Williams, a Democratic mail strategist based in Duluth, Minn., near where Biden campaigned Friday.\\n\\n“College-educated white voters were the first group that moved away from him,” Williams said, and now Trump is “starting to drive away noncollege-educated white voters,” too.\\n\\nAt the center of Trump’s reelection math has always been the expectation that he could turn out more white, noncollege-educated voters in 2020 than he did in 2016, squeezing more juice from a diminishing base. Nick Trainer, the Trump campaign\\'s director of battleground strategy, said \"the vast majority of polls are oversampling Democrats and are relying on an outdated sampling formula.\"\\n\\nWeekly Score Your guide to the year-round campaign cycle.

And if he can turn them out in greater numbers, he could shift the electorate toward him in several predominantly white states. Republicans and Democrats alike estimate there are hundreds of thousands of unregistered, noncollege-educated whites in key swing states that Trump could still pick up.\\n\\nThat fight for those voters was on display in Minnesota on Friday, where Trump and Biden appeared not in the Minneapolis-St. Paul suburbs, but in more culturally conservative, northern reaches of the state. Republicans there and in some of the whitest counties in the country say they haven’t seen any falloff for Trump, and many of them suspect that polls are still underrepresenting his support.\\n\\nStephanie Soucek, chair of the Republican Party in Wisconsin’s Door County said she sees more Trump signs in her county than she did in 2016. Jack Brill, acting chair of the local Republican Party in Sarasota County, Fla., said “the base in Sarasota County is as strong as ever.”\\n\\nIn Duluth, the target of much attention from the Trump campaign, the city’s former mayor, Gary Doty, acknowledged that the president may have shed some support among some white women because of “the way he presents himself. He’s sometimes crude and rude, and I don’t care for that style.”\\n\\nHowever, he said, “I think there’s this silent group of people” who support Trump and will turn out for him.\\n\\nDoty said that after he endorsed Trump recently, “people that wouldn’t talk to me about politics … after they heard I had supported the Trump ticket, would come say, ‘Hey, I’m for him, too.\\'\"\\n\\n'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/21/trump-biden-foreign-policy-419130', 'Full Text': 'POLITICO Dispatch: September 21 Just a handful of states could decide who becomes the next president. POLITICO reporters from across the country break down what it will take for Donald Trump and Joe Biden to win over the most critical voters.\\n\\nThere’s little question Biden’s foreign policy would look and feel a lot different than Trump’s. The former vice president speaks often about restoring alliances, promoting human rights and standing up to dictators — themes you don’t often hear from Trump. In his convention speech, Biden vowed to “work in common purpose for a more secure, peaceful, and prosperous world.”\\n\\nUnderstandably, Biden tends to say less about the Trump policies he’d keep. His campaign would reveal only that his “focus is going to be on rebuilding America’s standing in the world and undoing the incredible damage Donald Trump has wreaked.”\\n\\nStill, based on talks with a half-dozen people in and around the Biden campaign, here are some ways in which U.S. foreign policy may not change all that much if Trump loses to Biden in November.\\n\\nA tougher tone\\n\\nTrump has taken a bullying tone toward many countries, including some allies he’s accused of freeloading. “Angela, you owe me $1 trillion,” he’s reported to have once said to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, misstating the financial underpinnings of the NATO military alliance.\\n\\nWhile Biden is not likely to be so crude, don’t be surprised if he at times takes a more forceful position toward both allies and adversaries than he did when he served as Barack Obama’s vice president.\\n\\nThe obvious top target for this tone is an adversary China, which itself has taken a more bellicose attitude toward the United States in recent months.\\n\\nUnlike Trump, Biden probably won’t use terms like “China virus,” which have offended many Asians amid the coronavirus pandemic. But he appears to have laid aside his past hopes that increased global engagement would nudge China toward democracy. Biden once said “a rising China is a positive, positive development, not only for China but for America and the world writ large.” More recently, he’s called Chinese leader Xi Jinping a “thug,” accused China’s leaders of committing genocide against Uighur Muslims and pledged to rally countries to hold China accountable for its economic “cheating.”\\n\\nBiden also is likely to keep up the pressure on allies, including Germany, when it comes to defense spending. Obama’s first Defense secretary, Robert Gates, bluntly warned NATO in a 2011 speech of “the real possibility for a dim, if not dismal future for the trans-Atlantic alliance.” U.S. pressure led to a 2014 deal in which NATO members agreed to strive for the goal of spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024.\\n\\nTrump’s harsh rhetoric on the topic — he’s privately threatened to pull the U.S. out of NATO — might even give Biden more room to push the issue while still presenting himself as a welcome alternative to Trump. And how much other NATO members spend on defense could be a particularly salient issue if Biden bows to demands from progressives to cut U.S. defense spending.\\n\\nThe removal of Trump as an irritant could expose the fact that certain trans-Atlantic differences of opinion go well beyond the current occupant of the Oval Office. Germany, for one, has been reluctant to sign up for across-the-board confrontation with China, which has become a major trading partner. Many European countries also rely on Russia for energy supplies, so they tread carefully in dealings with Moscow.\\n\\nTrump’s overt hostility toward multilateral institutions could present Biden with an opportunity to push through reforms to some international bodies. That includes the World Health Organization, which Trump has moved to quit, and the World Trade Organization, which is increasingly dysfunctional thanks to U.S. decisions.\\n\\nAnother example: Trump quit the U.N. Human Rights Council on the grounds that it was too focused on Israel and that its members include notoriously abusive governments. Instead of simply reinstating its support for the council, Biden could engage it while echoing Trump’s criticisms to push for reforms.\\n\\nBiden also wants to host a summit for the world’s democracies. Such a gathering is an obvious slap at Trump, who has praised many dictators. But it’s also an implicit challenge to bodies like the U.N. Security Council, where autocracies like China and Russia often block U.S. initiatives. The idea recalls a proposal once pushed by late Republican Sen. John McCain, who called for establishing a “league of democracies” during the 2008 presidential campaign.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump participates in a United Nations Security Council briefing on counterproliferation at the United Nations General Assembly, Wednesday, Sept. 26, 2018.\\n\\n| Evan Vucci/AP Photo\\n\\nMeaningful punishments\\n\\nTrump is known for using sticks more than carrots in his interactions with other countries. Sanctions and tariffs, which don’t necessarily require congressional action, are among the president’s favorite sticks. He has relied on both to unusual degrees to pursue his agenda on everything from trade to the imprisonment of Americans overseas.\\n\\nExpect Biden to keep many of these penalties in place.\\n\\nTrump’s tariffs on China would give Biden some leverage over an increasingly hostile Beijing, and he has hinted he might keep at least some during the initial months of his presidency. Although Biden has described Trump’s use of tariffs as “shortsighted,” he’s also asserted: “I will use tariffs when they are needed, but the difference between me and Trump is that I will have a strategy — a plan — to use those tariffs to win, not just to fake toughness.”\\n\\nThe tariffs “could come off, but no administration is likely to remove them without getting something in return,” said Richard Fontaine, CEO of the Center for a New American Security.\\n\\nOther Trump policies toward China, including technology restrictions and limits on the movements of its diplomats in the United States, also could be here to stay. Given the increasingly widespread and bipartisan desire in Washington to stand up to China’s communist government, Biden could face blowback for moves that could be portrayed as soft on Beijing.\\n\\nThe Trump administration also has imposed economic and visa sanctions against an array of individuals. Biden might decide to remove some of those sanctions, such as the ones targeting officials with the International Criminal Court; but he’s likely to keep many of the so-called Magnitsky sanctions Trump has imposed on individuals overseas for corruption and human rights abuses.\\n\\n“He may not have agreed with some of the steps put in place by Trump, but now that they are in place, he’s not going to lift them wholesale without thinking through what he might be able to get for lifting them,” one former U.S. ambassador said about Biden.\\n\\nImmigration is a particularly tricky area. Trump has put in place unusually stringent limits on people seeking to come to the U.S., including severely lowering the number of refugees and outright banning immigrants from some countries. Biden has pledged to reverse these and many other Trump immigration policies.\\n\\nBut if Biden wants to strike a comprehensive immigration reform deal with Republicans, it could help to keep at least some of the changes made under Trump. One obvious possibility: Successful enhancements to security procedures designed to keep out potential terrorists. Another possibility: New rules that make it harder for foreigners to come to America to give birth to children who would then have U.S. citizenship — so-called birth tourism.\\n\\nAt times, it appears Biden is trying to walk a fine line on immigration. He’s said, for instance, that he won’t tear down the existing portion of a wall Trump has built along the southern border, but that he won’t add to it. Instead, he’s pledged to pursue more technologically advanced ways to secure the boundary.\\n\\nHard to reverse\\n\\nA few Trump-era moves would be politically and practically hard to jettison.\\n\\nBiden already has said he won’t reverse Trump’s decision to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and recognize that city as the Israeli capital. Biden has said relocating the embassy again won’t help the dormant peace process between Israelis and Palestinians. He has, however, pledged to reopen the U.S. Consulate that dealt with the Palestinians, which Trump shut down.\\n\\nBiden also is unlikely to re-recognize Nicolas Maduro as president of Venezuela.\\n\\nTrump dropped official U.S. recognition of Maduro in January 2019, instead recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president. Going back on all that would be … awkward. Besides, disdain for Maduro — a dictator who has overseen the economic ruin of his country — is widespread in Washington and among U.S. allies in Latin America.\\n\\nBiden probably will tweak the overall U.S. policy toward Venezuela somewhat, possibly to encourage more dialogue between the opposition and the Maduro regime. Democrats also have criticized how little attention Trump has paid to humanitarian suffering and refugee flows from Venezuela and Central America. A Biden administration will likely try to address the problem.\\n\\nTrump didn’t feel encumbered by international agreements made by his predecessor; he pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal despite the advice of some of his top aides. Iran, in response, has taken steps to restart its nuclear program, making it harder for Biden to achieve his stated goal of rejoining the deal.\\n\\nTake the deal\\n\\nThe Trump administration negotiated an update to the North American Free Trade Agreement dubbed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Biden has already said he supports the USMCA. He also will likely hang on to Trump’s “phase one” trade deal with China, though that pact is fragile.\\n\\nOverall, a President Biden is expected to show much more skepticism toward trade deals than he has before in his decadeslong political career. That skepticism also aligns him, to some degree, with Trump, though for different reasons.\\n\\nTrump has long been convinced that both allies and adversaries have been ripping off the United States in trade deals. Biden, under pressure from progressives, says he wants to pursue trade deals that don’t exacerbate economic inequality. Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership; Biden has been coy about whether he’d rejoin that massive pact, which he once championed, saying he’d want to renegotiate parts of it.\\n\\nBiden campaign officials say they want to focus first on the domestic economic recovery, in a nod to the difficult political climate for launching any new trade deals right now. But the Trump administration is currently negotiating trade agreements with Britain and Kenya; if Biden wins and those deals are unfinished, he’ll have to decide whether to pursue them or put them on hiatus.\\n\\nWhy not build on it?\\n\\nObama wanted to leave Afghanistan. Trump wants to leave Afghanistan. And Biden also wants to leave Afghanistan. So expect the Biden team to look for ways to maintain peace talks with the Taliban, who, under Trump, have agreed to a deal that is still being implemented.\\n\\nThe details, though, could derail the agreement. Biden, for instance, wants to keep a small number of U.S. troops in the country to battle terrorist groups such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State. The Taliban want all U.S. and NATO troops out.\\n\\nEvents on the ground could also force Biden’s hand. As it makes peace plans with the U.S., the Taliban has continued to battle with forces loyal to the Afghan government, which remains fragmented and divided over how best to end the country’s internal conflict.\\n\\nEven if the current deal falls apart, a Biden administration will likely try to keep the channels open to strike a new agreement. The Trump-era deal could offer a template to build upon.\\n\\nIn fact, one person close to the Biden campaign said it’s possible that if he wins, he may ask Trump’s envoy to the talks, Zalmay Khalilzad, to stick around for a few months to help the new administration find its footing with the Taliban.\\n\\nWhen asked about this possibility during a recent call with reporters, Khalilzad said it was too soon to discuss the idea, but that he was committed to staying at least until November’s election.\\n\\nBiden also has said he wants to build on a push by the Trump administration to get Arab countries to normalize their relations with Israel.\\n\\nEarlier this month, representatives of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain joined Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at a White House ceremony to sign pledges to establish diplomatic, economic and other ties. It was a historic moment, and one Biden applauded.\\n\\n“A Biden-Harris administration will build on these steps, challenge other nations to keep pace,” Biden pledged.\\n\\nHe added a caveat, though, saying his administration would use the momentum to “leverage these growing ties into progress toward a two-state solution and a more stable, peaceful region.”\\n\\nTrump’s approach to these agreements has made scant mention of the Palestinians, and put zero emphasis on the idea of a two-state solution. Biden’s desire to make a two-state solution a goal of the normalization push will no doubt complicate things, not least because the Israeli right wing would fight it.\\n\\nDoug Palmer and Lara Seligman contributed to this report.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/24/gop-super-pac-campaign-ron-kind-420897', 'Full Text': 'The group’s spot contrasts the military service of Kind’s opponent, Derrick Van Orden, with what it calls the congressman’s dereliction of duty.

Instead they must address the economic concerns of working-Americans—of all races—while also calling out Republicans’ attempts to divide Americans based on race.\\n\\nWe know this because in 2018, the progressive group Rural Organizing surveyed 820 rural Americans to test the power of the following message: “Instead of delivering for working people, politicians hand kickbacks to their donors who send jobs overseas. Then they turn around and blame new immigrants or people of color, to divide and distract us from the real source of our problems.” Note the three elements: 1) Americans of all races need good-paying jobs; 2) politicians have let the donor class gut Americans’ standard of living; 3) then they try to deflect the blame onto immigrants or people of color. In the survey, three-quarters of rural respondents agreed with this message, which appealed not just to liberal voters (who made up only 23 percent of the respondents), but also to the 42 percent who were conservatives and the 26 percent who were moderates.\\n\\nCritical race scholar Ian Haney López calls this kind of messaging the race-class narrative, and he argues that it is critical to reaching the 59 percent of American voters he calls the “persuadables.” López, along with messaging consultant Anat Shenker-Osorio and pollster Celinda Lake, document that race-class messaging is more convincing among persuadables than “colorblind economic populism”—that is, messaging that invokes class alone. Crucially for Democrats, these scholars have found that white, Black and Latino persuadable voters all find race-class narratives more convincing than color-blind populism, by similar margins.\\n\\nWe can expect a significant subset of Trump voters to be receptive to a race-class message. A 2017 study by the Democracy Fund’s Voter Study Group found that about one-fifth of Trump voters have bipartisan voting habits and warm feelings toward racial minorities. The study calls these voters “anti-elites,” and they present a major opportunity for Democrats: 83 percent of them think the economic system is biased in favor of the wealthiest Americans, and 68 percent of them favor raising taxes on the rich.\\n\\nDemocrats often get tarred as the party of elites because their positions in the culture wars clash with those of blue-collar Americans, especially whites and Latinos, who tend to place a high value on self-discipline and the traditional institutions that anchor it, notably religion, the military and “family values.” Republican politicians naturally want to keep attention focused there. But Democrats should focus on making the affirmative case that their party understands voters’ economic aspirations and economic pain much better than the GOP.\\n\\nNone of this means Democrats will need to retreat from their reputation as the party of diversity and inclusivity. As vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris has persistently pointed out, the economic pain so prevalent today falls on many Americans, from young Black men without jobs in cities, to middle-aged white men on disability or opioids, to women of all races stuck in underpaid dead-end “essential” jobs, to gig workers trying to make ends meet, to young adults still living in their parents’ basements. There’s enough economic pain to go around that it should be a central unifying issue for Joe Biden’s campaign going forward. Democrats need to commit to bringing economic opportunity to Americans of all education levels and every region of the country. That’s why one of us, who represents Silicon Valley in Congress, has teamed up with Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) to bring Silicon Valley companies and investors to cities in Ohio, Indiana and Michigan. That’s the right message for Democrats.\\n\\nWhy is this so urgent? Biden’s margin in crucial swing states is razor thin. Pollster Stanley Greenberg has found that in the last two weeks before the 2016 election, when Hillary Clinton talked about the contrast between her and Trump’s economic policies and the changes she would bring, she consolidated her lead. Clinton’s largest lead was during the debates, when she hit Trump on the economy; afterward, she talked much less about the economy. Famously, Bill Clinton reportedly begged to be allowed to go to the Rust Belt but wasn’t. Let’s not make that kind of mistake again.\\n\\nBiden appears not to be making the same mistake. Even during the pandemic, he has traveled to Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, where he pushed a “promises made, promises broken” theme, saying: “Under Donald Trump, Michigan lost jobs even before Covid hit. What about offshoring? Has Trump delivered on stopping companies from shipping American jobs overseas? You already know the answer. Of course not.”\\n\\nWe hope to see a lot more of this in the coming weeks. It should be dead easy for Biden to connect with America’s “anti-elite” voters. He was born to an economically precarious family in blue-collar Scranton. He already knows what he needs to do: Signal “I see you, I value you, and I will deliver for your family and your community. Hard work should pay off for hardworking Americans—Black, white and brown.” Then, he must explain concretely how Democrats will make sure hard work pays off—and Republicans won’t.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/09/18/trump-new-york-times-fight-1619-history-417868', 'Full Text': \"The Trump plan, announced in his speech, is to establish a “1776 Commission” that will “promote patriotic education” and beat back the alleged slanders against the nation’s character. It’s likely to accomplish nothing. Likewise, the federal grant “to support the development of a pro-American curriculum that celebrates the truth about our nation’s great history” that he talked about at the National Archives Museum will likely achieve nothing concrete.\\n\\nIn attempting to place his personal, political mark on what children learn in schools, Trump is no originator. In a fine survey piece this week by Olivia B. Waxman in Time, we learn that the political quarrel over the past—what the history textbooks should say, which accounts are elevated and which suppressed in the classroom, who composes curricula—has been contested in every generation since the Civil War. The historical is the political. For all the anxiety Trump’s foray into classroom history is stirring up among horrified liberals, the only real surprise is how late he arrived on the field.\\n\\nThat doesn’t mean Trump’s speech was an exercise in futility. It expanded his usual attack on the press by essentially accusing the New York Times of the political corruption of our youth. Said Trump, “This project rewrites American history to teach our children that we were founded on the principle of oppression, not freedom.” It also aligned Trump against teachers—few of whom were going to vote for him anyway—and the educational establishment, once mocked by Trump’s spiritual godfather George Wallace, who liked to refer to “pointy-head college professors who can’t even park a bicycle straight.”\\n\\nSince the earliest days of his presidency, Trump has sought to pit the “us” of himself and his crowd of cheering supporters against a nebulous “they”—that ever-expanding list of his enemies and foes, including but not limited to immigrants, the “deep state,” Democrats, reporters, note-takers in meetings, judges who defy him, residents of blue states, the makers of dishwashers, Mitt Romney, the Washington establishment, Muslims, his critics, the Chinese, former Cabinet members, whistleblowers and practically anybody who contradicts him. Trump stirs up and harnesses human animus better than any of his contemporaries, and it’s just like him to construct a fraudulent line of association that links rioting anarchists to revisionist historians to establishment journalists and finally to the educational establishment and wraps them all up in one tidy ball for kicking.\\n\\nIt's also a notable departure for a man known almost entirely for his inability to look past the present moment. Trump, officially, is no longer content with being the mere arbiter of the present, requiring compliance and agreement from everybody in the room. By attacking journalists, appointing a commission to lock down history in a way that pleases him and giving grant money for a “pro-America” curriculum, Trump intends to assert a new ownership interest in the past. “Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past,” George Orwell wrote in Nineteen Eighty-Four.

Aside from apportioning House seats, the Census provides the statistical basis for many governmental funding decisions for the next decade. Each year, roughly $1.5 trillion in federal funds get redistributed according to census data.\\n\\nWith undercounted populations disproportionately made up of Black Americans, Latinos, lower-income households and immigrants, an undercount would mean not only less political representation for those groups, but also fewer resources going to those communities. “It is a political issue, but it’s also just an issue of access to the resources of our country,” said Frey.\\n\\nWhat could go wrong? How is this year’s census shaping up differently than past counts? And what are the short- and long-term effects of everything we’re about to encounter? To sort through it all, POLITICO spoke with Frey on Thursday. A transcript of that conversation is below, condensed and edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nStanton: You've studied the census. You’re a demographer. Walk us through how a census normally works, and how the pandemic has changed the way the census is working this year.\\n\\nFrey: Normally, the census is the culmination of 10 years of hard work by people at the Census Bureau and their partners around the country. It’s a huge civic-engagement exercise that people take a lot of pride in. Census Day — April 1st every 10 years, when the census begins to be administered — is a time of celebration and public events and civic leaders getting everybody to fill out their census forms. The results come in, and at the end of December, they are released to the states and used to reapportion House seats and draw congressional and state legislative districts, which is the official reason for the census.\\n\\nThen, over the following year, more detailed data come out for smaller geographic areas, different populations and subgroups — like where people are living or where populations are growing — and get used by researchers for the next decade. It’s used for all kinds of planning. I’m a demographer, so I’m biased, but I think it’s probably one of the most important government functions there is. There’s usually not a lot of politics around it; it’s usually a feel-good kind of operation. That’s the kind of census that we were hoping to have.\\n\\nStanton: I sense there’s a “but” coming.\\n\\nFrey: Yes. This year, the Census Bureau was hit with a huge impediment: the pandemic. On April 1, Census Day, most people were worried about the pandemic. You saw very little about it in media, because coronavirus cases were popping up, and places were closing down and people were worried about how they were going to get to work or if they were going to have work. The census was not on people’s minds. More importantly, from the operational standpoint, the Census couldn’t conduct the kinds of operations they normally would.\\n\\nThe pandemic really threw a monkey wrench into the whole process. Around the middle of April, the Census Bureau decided that it had to postpone a lot of its follow-up activities. Normally, they do something called NRFU — “non-response follow-ups.” That’s when they follow up with people who did not fill out their census forms. Normally, that would take place between the middle of May and the end of July, which allows the bureau to take the time between the end July and the end of December — when they have to report the results of the census to the president — to deal with all sorts of logistical issues and make sure there weren’t double counts. This is the biggest survey in the world, and they only get one chance every 10 years to get it right.\\n\\n“This is the biggest survey in the world, and they only get one chance every 10 years to get it right.”\\n\\nUnder normal circumstances, they would have begun that cleanup at the end of July. But in April, they decided that they had to push back everything because of the pandemic: Rather than have the NRFU go from mid-May to the end of July, they shifted it to go from mid-August until the end of October. As a result, they thought they would not be able to report the results to the president by the end of December and requested that Congress give them a four-month lag so that they would have until the end of April.\\n\\nBut a bigger issue came at the end of July, when President Trump came out with a memorandum that said he wanted to figure out how many undocumented immigrants were included in the census counts of each state in order to exclude them for the purposes of congressional reapportionment. Now, if you've been following this issue, you know that he’s been trying to do something like this for a long time. Initially, he wanted to put a question on the 2020 Census, something like: “Are you a citizen or are you not a citizen of the United States?” It got struck down by the Supreme Court and he wasn’t able to do that. This is a way around that to try to accomplish the same goal. It’s probably not legal, and there are many lawsuits about it, but it takes a while for things to go through the courts. So that’s one part of the bombshell.\\n\\nThen, the other shoe dropped on Aug. 3, when the president said that all of this planning that the Census Bureau did to postpone the delivery of results so that they could ensure the numbers were good and they could follow up with nonresponses — he wants to rush that, and they still need to get those results in to him by the end of December. And now, the Census Bureau has to stop following up with nonresponsive people at the end of September, a month early, which will give them three months to fix everything, instead of the normal five or six. Of course, they cannot do the same kind of diligent job in just three months.\\n\\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS The Friday Cover Get POLITICO Magazine's newsletter featuring the best stories of the week and our Friday Cover delivered to your inbox.

You’re going to wind up with results that severely undercount large parts of the population — the “hard to count” populations, including people of color, immigrants, poor people, very young people, renters and a whole list of people who are going to be undercounted and underrepresented in terms of political clout as well as services and government funds, which use the census as a benchmark for the next 10 years. Something like $1.5 trillion of federal funds annually get redistributed on the basis of these census counts. It’s a real problem.\\n\\nIt puts the Census Bureau in a horrible situation. For those of us who analyze data and want to do research—and even more importantly, for people who are planning policy or allocating federal funds—this puts everybody in in a huge predicament.

We’re just going to hit and run on the first pitch.’ ‘OK, OK, OK.’” And? “So, um, it didn’t work, because before the guy even threw a pitch to the plate, he picked D off.” Stuper called it “a cardinal sin” to “get picked off on a hit and run.” He added, “He may have forgotten that, but I haven’t.”\\n\\n“Absolutely,” DeSantis said in his office, more than 22 years later, when asked whether he remembered.\\n\\nThe governor said it was the umpire’s fault.\\n\\n“See, what happens,” he said, “is when you have a two-man umpiring crew, the base umpire is behind the pitcher, so what a pitcher would do is a balk move. They would lift the left heel, like they were going to the plate, but then they would turn around. And so Stuper was, like, ‘You can never get picked off on that.’ I was, like, ‘Coach, he balked.’”\\n\\nDeSantis keeps a minuscule inner circle. It often can consist of just his wife and his chief of staff. Sometimes, some say, it’s not even that. “The political circle is linear,” said Scott Parkinson, a former chief of staff, “and it is him and Casey.” And that was true right from the start.\\n\\nEarly in 2012, Travis Cummings was readying to run in Northeast Florida for a spot in the state House, and he was having lunch with Kent Stermon—who now is near the top of the short list of friends of DeSantis but back then hadn’t met him. Cummings told Stermon about DeSantis, calling him “interesting” and “just kind of this upstart guy,” Stermon recalled. A couple days later there was a knock at his door. It wasn’t Ron DeSantis. It was Casey DeSantis, a midday host on the highest-rated network affiliate in Jacksonville, whom he married in 2009. She was “stumping for him,” Stermon said.\\n\\n“I said, ‘Hey, I’m going to this charity event later on tonight. There’ll be a ton of money in the room. Bring your husband. I’ll introduce him to people.’ She’s, like, ‘We’ll be there.’ And it’s like a hundred degrees outside—it’s like 3 o’clock—and they gotta be there at like 6 o’clock. I told my wife, ‘There’s no way they show up’—6:15, there they walk up.”\\n\\nThat year, in his first campaign for elected office, DeSantis was, at 33 years old, in the right place at the right time and not by accident. He had identified an open seat in Congress in Florida’s newly drawn 6th District, stretching from Jacksonville to Orlando but not actually including any part of either city, “a tweener district,” in the words of a Democratic strategist, somewhat under the radar and eminently winnable for a Republican.\\n\\nDeSantis just had to get through a jumbled primary. To do that, he ran not so much against the six other GOP candidates but against the sitting president. Against the government. Against Washington. The double Ivy Leaguer ran as an outsider, as a Tea Party hard-liner, as a “constitutional conservative” in the mold of Senators Mike Lee and Ted Cruz. He wanted to roll back environmental regulations and eliminate the Department of Energy and repeal the Affordable Care Act. He wanted stronger border security, opposing amnesty for undocumented immigrants. He opposed all gun reform. He said food stamps should have on them a picture of Barack Obama and that the president wanted to create “a dependency culture.” He said a second term of Obama would mean the “death knell” of “limited government.” His pitch attracted the attention and the endorsements of national conservative groups like FreedomWorks, the Club for Growth and the Conservative Victory Fund; of Lee, the Utah senator; of controversial Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio; of John Bolton—and of the most prominent peddler of the racist conspiracy theory that Obama wasn’t born in the U.S.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/08/government-communication-propaganda-427290', 'Full Text': 'Presidential propaganda took a major troubling leap under Woodrow Wilson, who promised “pitiless publicity,” a progressive phrase calling for exposure of socio-political ills and government transparency. But when World War I came, he created our first and only ministry of propaganda, the Committee on Public Information, a body that did the opposite of provide public information.\\n\\nWhat had been a trickle of press releases under Roosevelt turned into a gusher of tendentious handouts from the CPI offices near the White House, as well as pamphlets, books, syndicated articles, posters, advertisements, cartoons and films. University professors were enlisted. Front organizations reached labor and immigrants. The Boy Scouts and traveling salesmen, among many others, were turned into conveyer belts for government information. Like Trump’s HHS feel-good advertising campaign, the CPI was created by a president without congressional approval.\\n\\nWild-eyed muckraker George Creel was the chief of the CPI. He was so good at what he did that what we call “spin” today was called “Creeling” during the war.\\n\\nEven before Wilson’s CPI came into being, Congress was not happy to have the president and executive agencies using public relations techniques to persuade the public. “This press-bureau business is a sort of political campaigning,” one legislator complained in 1913. Congress hounded Roosevelt to force his secretary of the Panama Canal Committee, a former journalist, to stop his public relations activities. It passed laws forbidding executive agencies to hire “publicity experts” or to use advertisements, telegrams and other means of mass communications to stoke public pressure on legislators to vote for or against any particular pending legislation. Legislators also added prohibitions to annual spending bills to prevent the use of funds for “propaganda and publicity purposes not authorized by Congress.”\\n\\nPresident Woodrow Wilson (left) and CPI chief George Creel (right). | AP Photo, Library of Congress\\n\\nTo little avail. Those laws are still in effect, but executive agencies have routinely evaded them. Officials get around the restriction on publicity agents by giving public relations staff such titles as “health communications specialist” or they outsource the spinmeister work to private communications firms. During an effort to cut back on PR in the administration of Harry Truman, the Air Force even classified some public affairs officers as chaplains.\\n\\nFederal agencies answering to the president routinely pressure Congress to pass presidential priorities — to stay within the law, they need only avoid mentioning a specific bill name or number. This happened often during the Obama administration; the Department of Labor, NASA and HHS issued communications pushing for Congress to increase the minimum wage, increase NASA funding, and enact Obamacare. On rare occasion, the Government Accountability Office will flag an agency for spending funds for illicit propaganda.\\n\\nBut there is no real penalty. The Department of Justice may simply disagree that there has been any wrongdoing, or the propagandizing agency may ignore GAO’s demand to repay the misspent money. No executive branch official has ever been charged with breaking these laws. And the majority in Congress tend to turn a blind eye when it is their president who does the propagandizing.\\n\\nAll of which explains why every administration does it. Obama had a $700 million PR blitz for his signature health care law. The George W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations both produced fake video news pieces to promote their new Medicare program benefits. And so forth.\\n\\nRepresentative democracy depends on government communicating honestly with the public. The public can’t hold elected leaders accountable if citizens don’t know what they are doing. Citizens also have a right to know how government is spending their money, and whether it is producing bang for the buck. Accurate government information also can serve public good purposes: It is helpful to know, for example, what the unemployment rate is, whether a hurricane is approaching, and how much children are learning in school.\\n\\nBut self-governance is corrupted when an administration uses taxpayers’ dollars to manipulate their beliefs about its performance or reality generally. This betrays a premise of our political system: that government exists to serve the public. The current administration’s playing down of the coronavirus peril and its confusing and self-contradictory advice to the public (e.g., Trump vs. his FDA on hydroxychloroquine) are a salient and existential example.\\n\\nWhich is why this nation desperately needs major reform of the ways that the executive branch communicates with the public. Here are three reforms that can start to right the flow of information from government to the public.\\n\\nFirst, Americans deserve an audit of how much the government is spending on communications with the public, and an assessment of where the dollars are going. Data from USASpending.gov indicate executive agencies will spend nearly $1.4 billion on advertising contracts with private firms. But this grossly understates actual expenditures, as it excludes the government’s in-house costs, such as the compensation earned by the legions of communications staff across the executive branch, or the costs for operating the government’s innumerable blogs and YouTube channels. The GAO has audited some individual agencies in the past, but Congress could direct it to assess all 170 federal agencies. In the course of doing that, the GAO could usefully propose a definition of “public communication” that all agencies would have to use in accounting for their spending. None presently exists.\\n\\nIt would be wise to establish uniform and publicly available standards that make clear what is expected of government agencies in their communications with the public.\\n\\nSecond, Congress should appoint a bipartisan, blue ribbon commission to consider ways to update the antiquated laws on government communications with the public. For instance, federal spending laws forbid agencies from using funds for unauthorized “publicity” or “propaganda” but fail to define these terms or even hint at differences between them and acceptable government communications. One standard, for instance, might require that communications should be balanced and written in a tone that does not extol the agency or its activities.\\n\\nThe law against employing publicity experts, which was enacted in response to Roosevelt’s self-promotion, is effectively useless now. And the statute forbidding agency communications with the public is anachronistic; for one thing, it forbids the use of telegrams, but not the internet. Nor do any of these laws provide for any sort of real punishment for violations. Not least, the panel should consider policies to stop agencies from spending funds to turn their spokespeople into media darlings.\\n\\nThis panel also could develop governmentwide guidelines for agency public communications practices, which Congress could enact into law. Right now, agencies—with some direction from the Office of Management and Budget—are free to develop their own communications policies. This hodgepodge of policies makes little sense, seeing as communications boondoggles and scandals are perennial. It would be wise to establish uniform and publicly available standards that make clear what is expected of government agencies in their communications with the public.\\n\\nCongress took a run at writing guidelines in 2001, when it passed the Information Quality Act. Rather than revise the few existing policies, it instead directed agencies to adopt policies “ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility and integrity of information (including statistical information) disseminated.” Regrettably, Congress simply trusted agencies to obey those vague guidelines and followed up very little to ensure compliance. This time around Congress would be wise to mandate information quality standards and require public reporting of agencies efforts to enact them.\\n\\nThird, the White House news conference needs an overhaul. Done right, the process of getting ready for a daily briefing contributes to government accountability. The press secretary reaches out to executive departments to assess the issues of the day and identify the corresponding administration policy. After looking at the daily press briefing book, Clinton was known to call a Cabinet secretary to say a better policy was needed.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/07/kamala-harris-generation-veep-debate-426994', 'Full Text': \"In our middle-class world, Black was an ever broadening umbrella, both by necessity in this country’s bifurcated color caste system, and by choice, as life changed under the Supreme Court’s 1967 landmark Loving v.

You could have a Filipino dad and a Black mom so light-skinned she made you do a double-take, and you’d still be Black.

Others, like me, grew up in the ’burbs and boroughs next door to white kids, attending prep schools or Catholic academies or the local public schools, part of a hugely optimistic, messy national experiment. (Never mind that folks had been crossing the color line for years, often by force, creating a rainbow of phenotypes among African Americans.)\\n\\nThis didn’t always make for some rosy kumbaya moment. We grew up with the specter of nuclear war hanging over our heads, when it really felt like it could all end with the push of a button, as Prince warned us in 1999.

Barack Obama, another integration baby, was mocked for his fluid code-switching. But for us, that’s not performance.

It’s an adeptness that has held Harris in good stead on the campaign trail, whether she’s jamming to a drumline, making dosas with Mindy Kaling or dragging Joe Biden for his record on school desegregation. And it’s an adeptness that will be on display as she faces off against Mike Pence in the first and only 2020 vice presidential debate.\\n\\nCompromise and consensus are a key personality trait of Generation Jonesers, particularly among Jonesers of color, said Jonathan Pontell, a social generation expert, who coined the phrase. But that compromising nature, in this era of political extremes, can seem out of step, something for which both Harris and Obama have faced criticism.\\n\\n“It’s a great skill to have as a politician, to be able to compromise, bring people together,” said Pontell, who’s working on a book about Generation Jones. “But I don’t know how realistic idealism is right now. We as a country are very tribal — and very angry.”\\n\\nJonesers, he said, were weaned on idealism as kids in the ’70s, only to be confronted as young adults with the money-hungry cynicism of the ’80s. We were the guinea pigs living through the real changes effected by the turmoil of the ’60s, turmoil we were too young to understand. As integration babies, Black Jonesers were raised with high expectations, expected to excel, to bust ceilings.\\n\\nBut racism is real, and often, when we were accepted into Harvard or Yale or Dartmouth or got that plum job, our peers, the kids we hung out with on the playground, accused us of being unworthy beneficiaries of affirmative action. Racism, we learned, has a particular sting when it’s being wielded by the one you thought was your ride or die. It’s why some of us, like Harris, embraced HBCU life, seeking belonging. Acceptance.\\n\\nStraddling the racial divide can be a painful and lonely place.

This means that the government has to have a very strong reason justifying the measure, or it gets struck down. A ban on voting based on race, for example, would trigger—and fail—this test. (Although Ginsburg worked to secure the highest possible test for gender, the Supreme Court settled on a lower, “intermediate scrutiny” standard for discrimination based on sex.) If the court decides that the restriction is not severe, a lower level of scrutiny applies, meaning the government doesn’t need to work so hard to justify it. As important as these standards are, unfortunately the Supreme Court hasn’t defined these terms with much clarity, affording judges a high level of subjectivity when they analyze whether a voting restriction should stand.\\n\\nBarrett knows this test well, because she applied it in a 2019 opinion she authored for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit. Acevedo v. Cook County Officers Electoral Board involved a Democratic primary ballot for Cook County sheriff in Illinois. County law required the candidate to obtain signatures equal 0.5 percent of the county’s qualified voters in order to get on the ballot. That meant the plaintiff, Edward Acevedo, had to collect 8,236 valid signatures. He failed, and sued, claiming the law violated his First and 14th Amendment rights to freedom of association and equal protection. Acevedo pointed to the lower statewide requirement of only 5,000 signatures, arguing that the county’s higher threshold was unconstitutional.\\n\\nIn Acevedo, Barrett decided that the need “for orderly and fair elections” outweighed the relatively nonsevere First and 14th Amendment interests of the candidate. The signature requirement, she ruled, was “not severe.” Prior cases made it “hard for Acevedo to show that the 0.5 percent requirement is anything but slight, which is perhaps why he doesn’t even try.” She concluded, “[i]t goes almost without saying that this slight burden is justified by Illinois’s relevant and legitimate state interests.” She made no mention of his First Amendment argument that ballot access burdened his free association rights.\\n\\nCertainly, a case involving a county sheriff has nowhere near the national impact of a case involving a presidential election as hotly contested as the one now underway. Nevertheless, the Anderson-Burdick test that would come into play in both should make a textualist such as Barrett squeamish.\\n\\nIt gives lifetime, unelected judges massive discretion to control state electoral processes with virtually no guiding principles from the Constitution itself. But that’s not Barrett’s fault. The test is one of many that are “read into” the Constitution by the Supreme Court—not because the justices are bad judges, but because the Constitution is hopelessly ambiguous. If a case involving the 2020 election reaches the Supreme Court over the constitutionality of state law requirements like signature-matching on mail-in ballots, notary public mandates for signing ballots, closed polling sites or limits on drop-off boxes, the Supreme Court will almost certainly apply this highly subjective test.\\n\\nFor Republican-led challenges to laws that make voting easier, the court will likely face the false argument that voter fraud is a serious problem in the United States. Studies show that voter fraud is exceedingly scarce, and there is no evidence to support Trump’s allegation that millions of undocumented immigrants in 2016 voted for his opponent. Will a conservative-leaning court apply low-level scrutiny and simply credit—without evidence—Republicans’ cynical arguments about staving off hypothetical voter fraud through identification requirements that disproportionately affect low-income Americans and people of color? Or will it nod in favor of voter access, in deference to the idea that the implied right to vote is the fulcrum of all other rights we hold dear?\\n\\nAfter Nov. 3, we can also anticipate Republican-led challenges to state laws that allow election officials to count ballots after Election Day. Indeed, many states mandate that counting begin only after the last ballot is cast. For an election with an anticipated avalanche of mail-in ballots, these laws mean that poll workers will have to match signatures (with no expertise and little training), open envelopes, unfold ballots, stack them, feed them into machines and resolve any disparities before the votes are fully tallied. In a minority of states, voters are given an opportunity to correct errors. If a case were to reach the Supreme Court challenging post-Nov. 3 ballot-counting, the court would again be faced with the squishy balancing test that allows judges to apply their own discretion in deciding if a burden is severe and unjustified. And again, elusive voter fraud will be the countervailing argument.\\n\\nFast forward to 2021, and imagine a Biden administration with a Democratic House and Senate.\\n\\nAfter Democrats won the House in 2018, the first piece of legislation passed was H.R. 1, which is widely praised by election law experts as a much-needed and reasonable set of reforms to America’s electoral system. Dubbed the For the People Act of 2019, the bill would make sweeping reforms to political gerrymandering (which the Supreme Court punted back to legislatures by rejecting a challenge in Rucho v. Common Cause last year), voting rights (which the Supreme Court hampered when it struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder in 2013), money in campaigns (which the Supreme Court ushered in en masse by lodging First Amendment rights in corporate speech in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission), and ethics rules for government officials (which is badly needed after Trump’s serial firing of inspectors general, a post-Watergate legislative reform designed to foster neutral oversight of those in power). Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked the bill in his chamber, but a new Democratic majority in the Senate would likely pass it, inviting inevitable conservative legal challenges.\\n\\nConservative jurisprudence has traditionally emphasized states’ rights and deference to lawmaking performed by lawmakers who represent the electorate—and not by judges. Challenges to state voting laws passed to facilitate access during a pandemic inescapably collide with the conservative touchstone of federalism. By the same token, challenges to acts of Congress confront the other conservative ideal, which aims to keep judges out of the business of legislating.\\n\\nFor all her professed devotion to conservative approaches to constitutional and statutory analysis, it is not entirely clear that Barrett wouldn’t readily defer to a state’s generic interest in “fair and orderly elections” or the voters’ access to the ballot if Trump’s election were hanging in the balance. Perhaps even more than abortion, voting rights is the key issue that Senators must probe deeply with Barrett in her confirmation hearing. Literally nothing is more important to the interests of their constituents.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/10/10/trump-taxes-biden-campaign-financial-crime-425160', 'Full Text': 'As all of this has been happening, there has also been a remarkable collapse in the Justice Department’s pursuit of white-collar crime. According to data maintained by Syracuse University that spans more than 30 years, the Justice Department’s number of white-collar prosecutions has repeatedly hit all-time lows during Trump’s tenure. To be sure, these problems did not all start under Trump’s watch—as law professor Jennifer Taub explains in her new book Big Dirty Money—but they have gotten markedly worse.\\n\\nThe divergent trends—increasing financial crime, decreasing enforcement—should already have been a national scandal. The sheer scale of the many other forms of corruption and ineptitude throughout this administration, however, seem to have prevented it from breaking through, particularly in light of the ongoing pandemic. Now is an opportune time for the Biden campaign to make the case to the public for a concerted crackdown on financial crime—to explain that the federal government desperately needs a prompt, wholesale and aggressive effort to improve the effectiveness of its law enforcement apparatus in this area, if there is any hope for change.\\n\\nThere are many reasons for the current state of affairs, even beyond Trump’s personal interests. One of them is that neither Attorney General William Barr nor former Attorney General Jeff Sessions seemed to have had much interest in pursuing financial crime. Barr has been more interested in expanding executive power and promoting Trump’s political and personal priorities. Sessions used the job to advance his interest in making life as difficult as possible for undocumented immigrants. There has also been a series of internal policy changes that have led to greater leniency in corporate criminal investigations—including the reversal of a policy created by former Obama Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates that required prosecutors to pursue individuals who committed criminal misconduct at corporations instead of merely entering into big-dollar settlements with the companies and moving on.\\n\\nMeanwhile, there has been a noticeable deficit of high-level prosecutorial talent in the department, owing at least in part to the fact (widely known in legal circles) that many prominent conservative lawyers did not want to work in the Trump Justice Department—due to distaste for the man and his policies, concerns over the long-term financial impact of going back to the private sector after working for the most divisive president in decades, or both. A surprising number of senior Justice Department officials overseeing wide swathes of the country’s criminal law enforcement work have never even been prosecutors. As a result, the Trump-era political appointees and career officials who manage the department’s work in this area have overseen a surprisingly long list of high-profile losses and setbacks in the last few years.\\n\\nCovid-19 appears to have made matters worse. There has been a wave of consumer financial fraud that has grown out of the pandemic that the Justice Department has done virtually nothing to address and that has resulted in more than 200,000 complaints to the Federal Trade Commission, totaling more than $150 million in losses. But because financial fraud is significantly underreported (many people are ashamed to admit that they have been victimized), the real numbers are likely at least several multiples of these figures. The department has also done little to pursue an international fraud on state unemployment agencies using stolen personal information from Americans, which has cost states at least hundreds of millions of dollars.\\n\\nThe issue has gotten virtually no attention during the general election campaign, but it was one of the many policy areas that Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren raised during the Democratic presidential primaries. Among other things, she campaigned on a law that she had proposed that would have allowed the government to criminally prosecute corporate executives who had negligently overseen companies where criminal conduct had occurred. That particular proposal had its detractors, but it represented much-needed fresh thinking in the area and started a discussion about the limits of white-collar criminal enforcement that had been dormant for too long.\\n\\nAfter Warren and others dropped out of the race, however, that issue fell by the wayside. Biden has instead pursued a campaign strategy structured around pledges to reunite the country, level the economic playing field and contain the pandemic. For better or worse politically, Biden’s campaign has let events dictate its priorities rather than try to direct the country’s focus. In so doing, Biden’s criminal justice plan has been focused on addressing the pervasive racial inequities in the system—which have rightly come under scrutiny again in recent months as a result of police violence and widespread protests—as well as other key progressive priorities, like reducing mass incarceration. But one effect of this gap in Biden’s public platform is that it has left his campaign at least partially flat-footed dealing with the stories on Trump’s taxes in the New York Times. If Biden’s campaign had had a concrete and comprehensive proposal to address white-collar crime and financial crime, this could have been a major opportunity for it to tie the news to specific policy ideas. It didn’t.\\n\\nVoters interested in this topic actually have some reason to be skeptical of the attention that this problem might receive in a Biden presidency, since the Justice Department during Barack Obama’s presidency drew a significant amount of criticism over its failure to pursue fraudsters and corporate misconduct after the last financial crisis. Which is why taking a more outspoken stand makes all the more sense for Joe Biden. There is even good reason to believe—as a strictly political matter—that doing so could draw the support of people from both the tough-on-crime right and the political left. It is an issue not nearly as ideologically polarizing as the race and policing questions that have dominated the campaign.\\n\\nWhat should Biden do? He could start by proposing to initiate a uniform federal effort to collect data on the national prevalence of financial crime, which, unlike for other crimes, does not yet exist. Ensuring the right people are in positions of power in the Justice Department would obviously be important too, but the administration under Biden could also issue a directive to local U.S. Attorneys’ offices throughout the country to make this a key priority for enforcement, much like the Trump administration did with immigration.\\n\\nThe Biden campaign could pledge that, if elected, his Justice Department would at least revisit—and strongly consider reversing—the changes to department policy under the Trump administration that have made the enforcement of financial criminal laws more lax, like giving leniency to corporations that self-report the misconduct of their employees. Biden could take a law-and-order approach, promising that his administration would seek a dramatic increase in funding for law enforcement agencies so that they can increase their capabilities, including by hiring more financial analysts, economists and prosecutors. He could promise to make a concerted effort to improve coordination between regulatory agencies and the Justice Department—particularly consumer protection agencies like the FTC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau—so that serious cases that lead to civil penalties receive appropriate attention as potential criminal matters too. For a candidate dogged by questions of how he would be able to pay for his proposed climate and health care programs, Biden could pledge to dramatically ramp up the IRS’ audit and enforcement capabilities, so that the government actually brings in more of the money it’s owed. And he could argue that the prosecution of criminal tax fraud would be a top priority.\\n\\nAs for Trump, in a properly functioning Justice Department, his tax avoidance, global financial entanglements, and unusual business and campaign transactions already would have attracted the attention of prosecutors. In fairness to the president, it is too soon to conclude that he has committed any crimes. That said, there would be more than enough reason for a very fulsome investigation if this were anyone but the president. But even setting Trump aside, one thing is clear: This country has been in the midst of an epidemic of financial crime that has been getting worse by the day. Now is the time for the Biden campaign to make this the prominent issue for voters that it can—and should—be.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/09/18/ruth-bader-ginsburg-legacy-418191', 'Full Text': 'That sense of moderation and strategy got her in hot water during her confirmation hearings, when abortion rights advocates worried that she was insufficiently supportive of the right to choose. In a lecture at NYU Law School just a few months before her nomination to the Supreme Court, she questioned the rationale and timing of Roe v. Wade, blaming the court’s overbroad decision for the continued political controversy over abortion. Given that she’s become a legal giant and progressive hero, it seems amazing that anyone once doubted Ginsburg’s pro-choice commitments.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court will now be as big an issue in the 2020 election as it was in 2016. It would be better if our law and politics didn’t turn on the physical health of judges, but, alas, that’s not the world we’re in.\\n\\n‘She never let abstract ideas distract her from reality’\\n\\nGillian Metzger is a professor and co-director of the Center for Constitutional Governance at Columbia Law School.\\n\\nJustice Ginsburg had an extraordinary mind. But unlike some great minds, she never let abstract ideas distract her from reality. Her deep and abiding commitment to justice and equality drove her analytic rigor, not the other way round. All of the great opinions she penned — Virginia Military Institute, her dissents in Ledbetter and Shelby County, even her dissent this last term in Little Sisters — were so powerful because she showed how our greatest constitutional principles and legal traditions must speak to and reflect the reality we all live. This focus on law in reality may have come from her years as a women’s rights advocate, but also was what led her to become an advocate in the first place. It is why she became so uniquely notorious, and her death is a huge loss.\\n\\nShe understood the potential in all people\\n\\nJohn Culhane is a professor of law and co-director of the Family Health Law & Policy Institute at Widener University Delaware Law School.\\n\\nThrough her long life, a life marked by surpassing courage and blinding luminescence, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg propelled this nation forward in so many ways. In the areas of voting rights, affirmative action and the march toward LGBT+ equality, her legacy will endure. But she will be most forcefully invoked for the tectonic shift she wrought for gender equality. Both women and men have benefited from the simple elegance of her insistence that people be judged by who they are and what they do — not by their assignment to frozen, long-unexamined roles. Among her numberless contributions to that project, perhaps her opinion for the Supreme Court in the Virginia Military Institute case, where the court ruled against the school’s exclusion of women, best encapsulates her philosophy. No law or policy, she wrote, can deny “to women, simply because they are women, equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in, and contribute to society, based upon what they can do.” Substitute “people” for “women” in that quotation to fully appreciate what Justice Ginsburg understood about the potential in all of us.\\n\\n‘The founding mother — or simply founder — of our nation’s sex equality jurisprudence’\\n\\nKenji Yoshino is a professor of constitutional law at NYU School of Law.\\n\\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg transformed sex equality law — as a professor, as an advocate, as a judge and then finally as a justice on the United States Supreme Court. We see that most clearly in her canonical majority opinion in the 1996 case of United States v. Virginia, which held that the Virginia Military Institute could not deny women admission. She wrote: “[G]eneralizations about ‘the way women are,’ estimates of what is appropriate for most women, no longer justify denying opportunities to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description.” Like its author, this sentence was quietly radical. Its logic means that if any woman can meet a state’s standard for an opportunity, no woman can be denied access to it. That view has resonated across the decades to gradually reduce sex stereotypes about women — and men. It helped lay the foundation for cases ranging from the court’s 2015 decision recognizing same-sex marriage to its decisions just last term barring employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\\n\\nIt would be too faint praise to observe that Justice Ginsburg’s own “talent and capacity” placed her far, far “outside the average description.” More than any other justice, she has embedded the principle that biology is not destiny into our fundamental law. As such, she can rightly be deemed the founding mother — or simply founder — of our nation’s sex equality jurisprudence. So it seems apt to bid her farewell bid her farewell with Chief Justice John Marshall’s words — penned just over two centuries ago — to the original Founding Fathers: “No tribute can be paid to [her] which exceeds [her] merit.”\\n\\n‘She was an exemplar of purpose and poise’\\n\\nJosh Blackman is a constitutional law professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston, an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute and the president of the Harlan Institute.\\n\\nOn September 17, we marked the 233rd anniversary of the signing of the Constitution. On September 18, we mourned the passing of a constitutional giant. Throughout her remarkable career, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg left an indelible mark on how our Constitution is understood, and she was an exemplar of purpose and poise. As an attorney, she litigated the landmark gender equality cases. Her strategy was simple but momentous: Make the all-male Supreme Court understand why the government should not discriminate against people because of their sex. As a Supreme Court justice, she eloquently and persuasively articulated her constitutional vision for nearly three decades. As a colleague, she modeled civility, even with her jurisprudential foes. It is well known that she became dear friends with Justice Antonin Scalia. And as a pop icon, she inspired a generation of young women to aspire for greatness. May her memory be a blessing. The only consolation for this sad moment is that Justice Ginsburg can now be reunited with her beloved husband, Martin. And I hope she can soon enjoy a performance of The Marriage of Figaro at the big opera house in the sky — with her old pal Justice Scalia humming along.\\n\\nShe reminded us that realizing America’s ideals is a work in progress\\n\\nRobert L. Tsai is a professor of law at American University and author of Practical Equality .\\n\\nThe promise of equality was her life’s work. From her pioneering litigation strategies as the head of the Women’s Rights Project at the ACLU to her quietly determined efforts to enforce the Constitution’s 14th Amendment as a justice on the Supreme Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg had the audacity to improve upon Thomas Jefferson’s famous words: “All men are created equal.” She understood that the phrase comprised a living commitment rather than a description of reality. Diminutive in size, she possessed a towering intellect and a tremendous heart — two things essential to understanding the needs of the perennially downtrodden.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2020/10/02/president-trump-and-melania-have-covid-19-what-now-490505', 'Full Text': \"POLITICO Playbook: President Trump and Melania have Covid-19.

We will be looking this morning for test results and assurance from VP MIKE PENCE and Speaker NANCY PELOSI.\\n\\n2) THE WHITE HOUSE does not have the public’s trust, and at a time like this, that’s important.\\n\\n3) THE PRESIDENT will be quarantined for some time, so the 2020 CAMPAIGN as we knew it will be effectively paused in its final stretch. How can they allow TRUMP in a room with the 77-year-old JOE BIDEN for another debate at this point? How can TRUMP hold another in-person rally? It seems extremely unlikely.\\n\\nTHE ENTIRETY of the president’s political message was that he handled the coronavirus pandemic well, the end was in sight, and people should think back to before the onset of the virus when they consider their vote.

That means that PENCE, PELOSI and Sen. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-Iowa) will likely have to take extra precautions. PELOSI is 80 and GRASSLEY is 87. They are No. 2 and No. 3 in the line of succession, after PENCE.\\n\\n5) BIDEN will certainly be tested.

Here are some details we’ve sussed out over the last few hours:\\n\\n-- PELOSI and Treasury Secretary STEVEN MNUCHIN are expected to work through this weekend. Everyone understands that one of the main issues is funding for state and local governments. The last offers traded were Dems offering $436 billion, and Republicans countering at $250 billion. ON THURSDAY, PELOSI and MNUCHIN held a private phone call with Fed Chair JAY POWELL to discuss state and local funding, and municipal lending. This call has not yet been reported, and underscored the lengths to which the two principals are going to try to get a deal.\\n\\n-- REPUBLICAN SOURCES ARE ALREADY WORRIED THAT MNUCHIN will relent on using ITIN -- a tax ID number -- instead of Social Security numbers to deliver checks to Americans. This is a hot-button issue because Republicans say it allows undocumented immigrants to get checks. This would be a non-starter in the Senate. But sources directly involved in the talks say this hasn’t been discussed at any level -- either staff or principal. BUT this is a good insight into how concerned the GOP is about a potential deal.\\n\\nBATTLE FOR THE SENATE … RALEIGH NEWS & OBSERVER: “U.S. Senate candidate Cal Cunningham admits to sexual texting with California strategist,” by Brian Murphy: “North Carolina Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Cal Cunningham, a married father of two, sent text messages of a sexual nature to a woman who is not his wife, his campaign confirmed Friday night. The text messages between Cunningham and Arlene Guzman Todd, a public relations strategist from California, were first reported Thursday night by NationalFile.com.\\n\\n“The report included pictures of the text messages, in which Cunningham and Guzman, who is also married according to the report, talked about kissing each other and more. ‘Would make my day to roll over and kiss you about now,’ said one text message from Cunningham. In one text from Guzman, she says: ‘I have flexibility this month — done with school, training, big RFPs, etc. So the only thing I want on my to do list is you.’ The Cunningham campaign confirmed the authenticity of the text messages.\\n\\n“Cunningham, who has been leading in polling in his pivotal U.S. Senate race against Republican incumbent Thom Tillis, said Friday night that he is not dropping out of the race. ‘I have hurt my family, disappointed my friends, and am deeply sorry. The first step in repairing those relationships is taking complete responsibility, which I do. I ask that my family’s privacy be respected in this personal matter,’ Cunningham said in a statement sent to The News & Observer.”\\n\\nVACCINE LATEST -- WSJ: “White House Takes Issue With FDA’s Plans for Authorizing a Covid-19 Vaccine,” by Thomas Burton: “Senior White House officials have raised objections to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s proposed standards for deciding whether a Covid-19 vaccine should be given widely and don’t appear likely to sign off on the agency’s guidelines, people familiar with the matter said.\\n\\n“In talks with the FDA in recent days, White House officials expressed a number of concerns about the draft guidelines, including a proposal that would require researchers to monitor study subjects for side effects for two months after getting a shot, the people said.\\n\\n“The disagreement could put the administration on a collision course with the FDA over whether and when to authorize use of a Covid-19 vaccine, once the late-stage trials that are testing the shots start providing data—perhaps in as little as a few weeks—on how the injections are performing.” WSJ\\n\\n-- “Warp Speed’s focus on vaccines may have shortchanged antibody treatments,” by Zachary Brennan\\n\\nUP NEXT -- “Debate commission accedes to Biden campaign’s ‘health and safety’ objections for VP debate,” by Natasha Korecki and Alex Isenstadt: “The Commission on Presidential Debates has agreed to seat Kamala Harris and Mike Pence 12 feet apart at the vice presidential debate next week, after the Biden campaign raised health and safety objections to the original spacing between the two candidates because of Covid concerns.\\n\\n“As of Friday evening, however, the commission would not accede to the Biden campaign‘s request that Harris and Pence stand during the debate.

Late last month, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh ruled that the decennial count must continue, ordering that the schedule the Census Bureau’s attempt to wrap up enumeration was inoperative due to the coronavirus pandemic, and counting should extend until the end of October.\\n\\n“Despite Koh’s ruling, the Bureau issued a brief statement on Monday saying that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross ordered the ‘target date’ to ‘conclude 2020 Census self-response and field data collection operations’ was Oct. 5. Koh rejected the Bureau’s decision to cut the count off on Oct. 5, writing that the Bureau was disobeying her original order. She said the Census Bureau was ‘chaotic, dilatory, and incomplete’ in following her original injunction, and issued a clarified injunction, directing the Bureau that it must continue its count through Oct. 31, and publicize its efforts to do so, including texting employees on Friday to inform them.\\n\\n“On Friday evening, a release from the Bureau said that it had messaged employees to say the count will go on. ‘As a result of court orders, the October 5, 2020 target date is not operative, and data collection operations will continue through October 31, 2020,’ the message read. ‘Employees should continue to work diligently and enumerate as many people as possible.

Covid offer stinks Presented by Facebook\\n\\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi said the Trump administration\\'s Covid relief offer was “one step forward, two steps back.” | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\\n\\nDRIVING THE DAY\\n\\nBREAKING … @GovChristie at 9:14 a.m.: “I am happy to let you know that this morning I was released from Morristown Medical Center. I want to thank the extraordinary doctors & nurses who cared for me for the last week. Thanks to my family & friends for their prayers. I will have more to say about all of this next week.”\\n\\nHERE IS A REMARKABLE FACT: President DONALD TRUMP and Speaker NANCY PELOSI haven’t spoken in nearly one year. Their last one-on-one conversation was Oct. 16, 2019 -- they had a brief interaction at the State of the Union, before PELOSI ripped the president’s speech up. In that time period, the nation has been turned upside down, shaken to the core by an unrelenting virus that has killed more 200,000 and hobbled a once vibrant economy.\\n\\nBUT THROUGH IT ALL, PELOSI and TRUMP have remained distant, unified only in their distaste for one another.\\n\\nALL OF THE SUDDEN, though, their incentives are aligned: they both want a massive Covid deal in an unthinkably quick timeframe. This may happen, it may not, but both sides seem to be rowing toward the same goal at the moment. Washington has never negotiated on a package of this magnitude this late into a presidential election year.\\n\\nTRUMP is unreadable and unplayable for most Washington observers because he, in fact, has no governing theory. But, in recent days, he has apparently decided that it is in his political interest to spend trillions of dollars.\\n\\nPELOSI has always wanted a big deal, but she’s hung on negotiating with Washington’s most eager man, STEVEN MNUCHIN. She wanted a deal, and MNUCHIN was her only option. (She has no patience for MARK MEADOWS, and the administration has no one else who knows what they’re doing.)\\n\\nDESPITE WHAT YOU MAY THINK, a deal isn’t all too close at this moment -- meaning as of early Saturday morning. PELOSI sent a letter to her Democratic colleagues saying that the $1.8 trillion offer from the administration was “one step forward, two steps back.” The letter explains where Pelosi finds fault in the GOP offer. State and local funding is “sadly inadequate,” she said, and the two are still $200 billion off in unemployment insurance. This could be a negotiating tactic, but even if so, these are real issues that need to be solved.\\n\\nIT’S IN PELOSI’S INTEREST to hold out for every last thing, given how eager the TRUMP administration is for a deal.\\n\\nPELOSI WANTS THIS TOO. On Thursday, during a private phone call with her leadership team, PELOSI revealed another one of her incentives to getting a deal: she thought it would be better to do it now so she didn’t have to do it early in a BIDEN administration.\\n\\nOF COURSE, STANDING IN THE WAY will be Senate Republicans, who don’t like the size of the bill, have issues with abortion policy and stimulus checks for undocumented immigrants, to name only a sliver of their gripes.\\n\\nTHE ODD bedfellows of PELOSI and the White House also includes the NYT ED BOARD, which said: “Let’s Make a Deal: The nation needs another round of federal aid. President Trump and Congress need to rise to the moment.\\n\\nFROM NYT’S EMILY COCHRANE and ALAN RAPPEPORT: “During a campaign forum Friday night, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said he was also in favor of passing another stimulus bill before the election and would be ‘willing to do almost $2 trillion.’ ‘I am excited that Pelosi and Mnuchin are talking again,’ he said. ‘Count me in for another stimulus package.’” WaPo … Sarah Ferris, Marianne Levine and Heather Caygle\\n\\nNATIONAL FRONTS … NYT (with a big story on last-ditch TRUMP machinations to try to win) … WAPO … WSJ\\n\\nWHAT AMERICA IS READING … THE NATION’S FRONTS: Charlotte Observer: “Despite his affair, some voters say they are still standing with Cunningham” … Denver Post: “Hickenlooper, Gardner find common ground” … Orlando Sentinel: “Trump coming to Sanford Monday”\\n\\n10 BYLINES! ...

For Republicans, the voting patterns underscore the huge bet they are placing on high turnout on Nov. 3, even as states like Wisconsin face safety concerns at polling sites given the spikes in coronavirus cases.\\n\\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or updates from POLITICO and you agree to our privacy policy and terms of service.

MAG’S OLIVIA NUZZI: “The Entire Presidency Is a Superspreading Event: Down in the polls, high on steroids, and clinging to good health while endangering everyone else’s”: “Donald Trump was on the phone, and he was talking about dying. It was Saturday, October 3, and while his doctor had told the outside world that the president’s symptoms were nothing to worry about, Trump, cocooned in his suite at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, was telling those close to him something very different. ‘I could be one of the diers,’ he said. …\\n\\n“Persuading him to leave the White House required an intervention from his doctors, members of the White House operations staff, the Secret Service, and his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. They had failed to stop the mass deaths of high-risk Americans, but they were going to save Trump, the most important high-risk American of them all. They told him, ‘This isn’t just your choice. This really isn’t about you. It’s about the presidency. Our job is to protect the presidency, and you occupy it.’ They asked him to think about the military and everyone else whose life would be upended if the state of the country’s leadership was in doubt.”\\n\\nCNN’S MANU RAJU: “Social distancing not common on Senate floor, despite McConnell\\'s claims”\\n\\nHOLLY OTTERBEIN: “‘Forgotten’ Pennsylvania region holds key to Trump’s fate”: “[President Donald Trump’s] ability to repeat -- or expand on -- his performance in Luzerne County is essential to his hopes of achieving an upset victory in this critical battleground state.\\n\\n“‘The Luzerne County voter was the definition of the forgotten men and women. Nobody in Washington was standing up for them. They’d lost hope,’ said former GOP Rep. Lou Barletta, a top Trump ally in Pennsylvania who represented a Luzerne-based district. ‘I don’t believe the president lost any support from 2016 here. If anything, he may have even gained more.’ Trump won working-class Luzerne by 26,000 votes in 2016 — nearly 60 percent of his margin of victory in a state that he narrowly carried. As part of his strategy to win Pennsylvania again, his campaign is betting on increased turnout in the small cities and rural reaches of the northeast.”\\n\\nBLOOMBERG’S JEN JACOBS: “Donald Trump Jr., who self-quarantined after traveling with people who later tested positive for the coronavirus, is planning to take part in 26 campaign events next week on behalf of his father, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday.”\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT’S SATURDAY -- THE PRESIDENT will speak at 2 p.m. at “a peaceful protest for law & order.”\\n\\nJOE BIDEN’S SATURDAY -- BIDEN will go to Erie, Pa., to talk about “building back the economy better for working families.”\\n\\nPLAYBOOK READS\\n\\nPHOTO DU JOUR: A medical team member is disinfected before leaving the Covid-19 ward at the Severo Ochoa hospital in Leganes, outskirts of Madrid, Spain, on Friday, Oct. 9. | Bernat Armangue/AP Photo\\n\\nALWAYS, ALWAYS READ MAUREEN DOWD: “James Murdoch, Rebellious Scion”\\n\\nDANIEL LIPPMAN: “Trump personnel office weighs asking appointees to offer their resignations”: “The White House Presidential Personnel Office is considering asking nearly every political appointee in the Trump administration to write and tender provisional letters of resignation right before the election, according to two senior administration officials.

They'll meet with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), Sen.Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria, according to the trade group.\\n\\nHOW HOTELS ARE PRESSING FOR A RESCUE: The New York Times’ Eric Lipton and Jeanna Smialek have some new details on hotels’ “aggressive campaign to convince Congress, the Treasury Department and others that the sector will go bust without a big bailout.” The hotels have been lobbying for help with loans that have been packaged into commercial mortgage-backed securities. “‘We need you to act — as often as possible — through calls, letters, and social posts to flood the offices of members of Congress,’ the American Hotel & Lodging Association wrote on Thursday in an email to its members.”\\n\\n— “At a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Wednesday, a top industry lobbyist said Congress should make a ‘technical amendment’ to an earlier relief package to explicitly allow a Treasury bailout. The committee’s chairman, Senator Michael D. Crapo, who has written two letters in recent months pushing Mr. Mnuchin and the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, to act, said during the hearing that the commercial real estate industry, including hotels, was “one of the most significant industries to lack access” to relief funds.” But the push “has put the Trump administration in a tough spot. … Industry lobbyists privately acknowledge that any effort to bail out the industry will generate criticism, given [President Donald] Trump’s dual role as both president and owner of a small luxury hotel brand.”\\n\\nTRADE GROUP DRAFTED EXECUTIVE ORDER SIMILAR TO THE ONE TRUMP SIGNED: Emails “obtained by ProPublica show that the meat industry may have had a hand in” an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in April meant to keep meatpacking plants open, ProPublica’s Michael Grabell and Bernice Yeung report. “Just a week before the order was issued, the meat industry’s trade group drafted an executive order that bears striking similarities to the one the president signed.”\\n\\n— “The draft that Julie Anna Potts, the president of the North American Meat Institute, sent to top officials at the U.S. Department of Agriculture was written using the framework of an official executive order and stressed the importance of the food supply chain and how outbreaks had reduced production — themes later addressed in the president’s order. … In a statement, Potts said that the meat institute had been working as a liaison between the government and industry on many issues related to COVID-19. ‘Trade associations of all types routinely suggest legislative language, comment on proposed rules, and other provisions that are shared with the government,’ she said.”\\n\\nTIKTOK DEAL POSES A WASHINGTON CONUNDRUM FOR ORACLE: POLITICO’s Steven Overly reports that Oracle’s partnership with TikTok could put the company “in conflict with its own push for social media regulation in Washington.” Oracle “has both directly and indirectly lobbied to pare down a key set of legal protections that shield internet companies from lawsuits over the content they host.”\\n\\n— “The protections, afforded under a section of federal law known as Section 230, are considered crucial to companies like Facebook and Google-owned YouTube that host billions of user-generated posts and videos each year. But they’ve been targeted by Oracle and at least one advocacy group funded by Oracle, whose core business until now hasn’t been as reliant on those protections as its competitors.”\\n\\n— The Wall Street Journal’s Georgia Wells, Aaron Tilley and John McKinnon, meanwhile, unearthed more of the deal’s backstory. One of TikTok’s investors, Sequoia Capital, “used its own connections to push the administration to allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S., say people familiar with the discussions. Doug Leone, the firm’s global managing partner who took a lead role lobbying on TikTok’s behalf, has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Republican candidates this election season along with his wife, including to the president’s re-election campaign. Mr. Leone also held a reception at his Silicon Valley home for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in January.”\\n\\nJOBS REPORT\\n\\n— Food Allergy Research & Education has hired Kevin Silard Sr. as senior director of corporate sponsorship.

The nonprofit, called the Empowerment Alliance, was set up last year and is funded by anonymous donors. Terry Holt, a Republican operative whose firm, HDMK, is consulting for the alliance, told PI last year that the group was up against a “flood of left-wing money that would have us virtually shut down” the natural gas industry.\\n\\n— The Empowerment Alliance has recruited more than 100,000 people to its grassroots network by running digital ads asking voters whether they “stand with President Trump’s American Energy Plan” and warning that Russia and Saudi Arabia are “Trying to Kill American Energy Independence,” according to the group. It’s also persuaded House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and dozens of other Republican lawmakers, governors and state attorneys general to sign a “Declaration of Energy Independence” championing “domestic natural gas discovered, produced, and refined in the U.S.”\\n\\n— “Though it won’t make the headlines, increasing natural gas production has resulted in lower energy costs for American families while reducing air pollution,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) wrote in an op-ed in July in which he noted he’d signed the nonprofit’s declaration. “And last year, the U.S. led the world in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, while providing affordable energy to everyone.”\\n\\nGood afternoon, and welcome to PI.

The trade group is pushing Congress to set up “grant programs or programs with some form of loan forgiveness,” such as a second round of Paycheck Protection Program loans and an expansion of the program “that waives the affiliation rule or counts employees by full time equivalents rather than headcount on payroll.”\\n\\nEMHOFF HEADLINES ‘LAWYERS FOR BIDEN’ EVENT: Sen. Kamala Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, and her brother-in-law, Tony West, headlined a ‘Lawyers for Biden’ fundraiser on Wednesday that drew more than 700 people, according to a pool report. The event had brought in $960,000 by the time it started. Emhoff is on leave from DLA Piper, where he’s a partner, and West is Uber’s chief legal officer. Jonathan Henes, a partner in Kirkland & Ellis’ New York office, introduced them.\\n\\nDEJOY TAPS REPUBLICAN LOBBYIST TO AID OUTREACH TO CONGRESS: Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told postal officials on Wednesday “that he had selected Peter Pastre, a former Republican congressional aide and insurance lobbyist, to act as a liaison for the agency with Congress and state and local governments, according to people familiar with the discussions,” The New York Times’ Ken Vogel, Hailey Fuchs and Luke Broadwater report. “The move came as the Postal Service was facing mounting political and operational crises. Mr. Trump has raised concerns about the security of voting by mail, and the independent quasi-governmental agency has struggled to overcome a delivery slowdown and a dire financial forecast — all while Democrats accuse Mr. DeJoy and the agency’s Republican-majority governing board of doing the president’s bidding.”\\n\\n— “Mr. Pastre, who worked in the 1980s as an aide to the Republican former Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming and made his reputation in Washington as a politically active government relations executive for the insurance industry, was chosen in part because he was seen by Postal Service management as someone who could reach out to Democrats, according to people familiar with the selection process. Mr. Pastre worked for 16 years at MetLife, where he directed the company’s federal political action committee, which has donated more to Republicans in recent years.”\\n\\nSELF-PROMOTION ISN’T CHEAP: “When Seema Verma, the Trump administration's top Medicaid official, went to a reporter's home in November 2018 for a ‘Girl's Night’ thrown in her honor, taxpayers footed the bill to organize the event: $2,933,” POLITICO’s Dan Diamond and Adam Cancryn report. “When Verma wrote an op-ed on Fox News' website that fall, touting President Donald Trump's changes to Obamacare, taxpayers got charged for one consultant's price to place it: $977. And when consultants spent months promoting Verma to win awards like Washingtonian magazine's ‘Most Powerful Women in Washington’ and appear on high-profile panels, taxpayers got billed for that too: more than $13,000.”\\n\\n— “The efforts were steered by Pam Stevens, a Republican communications consultant and former Trump administration official working to raise the brand of Verma, who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The prices were the amount a consulting company billed the government for her services, based on her invoices, which were obtained by congressional Democrats.”\\n\\n— “They are among the revelations included in a sweeping congressional investigation chronicling how Verma spent more than $3.5 million on a range of GOP-connected consultants, who polished her public profile, wrote her speeches and Twitter posts, brokered meetings with high-profile individuals — and even billed taxpayers for connecting Verma with fellow Republicans in Congress.”\\n\\nIF YOU MISSED IT ON WEDNESDAY: “TikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance Ltd., is discussing with the U.S. government possible arrangements that would allow the popular video-sharing app to avoid a full sale of its U.S. operations, according to people familiar with the matter,” The Wall Street Journal’s Miriam Gottfried, Georgia Wells and Kate Davidson report. “Discussions around such an option have risen in prominence since the Chinese government took steps that make a sale to a U.S. technology giant like Microsoft Corp. more difficult, the people said. They take place against a fast-approaching deadline that President Trump imposed for TikTok to agree to a sale of its U.S. operations or else be shut down, and as geopolitical wrangling over the app intensifies.”\\n\\nJobs Report\\n\\n— The Canadian quantum-computing company D-Wave Systems has hired Allison Schwartz as its global government relations and public affairs leader.

Windsor, the 2013 case that struck down a law preventing same-sex couples from receiving the same federal benefits as heterosexual couples, and she sided with the majority in the Supreme Court’s landmark 2015 ruling legalizing same-sex marriage.\\n\\nGinsburg also joined the court\\'s majority in a handful of high-stakes immigration rulings during the Trump administration, such as its surprising 5-4 decision rejecting President Donald Trump’s attempt to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program protecting undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. She also sided against Trump in a 2019 ruling that stopped the administration’s attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.\\n\\nBut Trump has since instructed the Commerce Department to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census count for the purpose of congressional reapportionment. That effort was blocked by a federal court earlier this month, but the administration appealed the case to the Supreme Court just last week.\\n\\nHere’s the rub: All of these cases were split along ideological lines, with a conservative member joining the court’s liberals — suggesting that an even greater conservative edge on the Supreme Court will change the outcome on similar issues in the future.\\n\\nWHAT NOW? Trump wants to fill Ginsburg’s vacancy ASAP, telling thousands of supporters at a campaign rally Saturday that he has a “moral duty” to replace her, and that his pick (to be revealed this week) will be a woman. The shortlist includes: Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, a devout Catholic; former Florida Supreme Court Justice Barbara Lagoa, now a federal appeals court judge who is Cuban-American; and Allison Jones Rushing, an appeals court judge in her late 30s who would be among the youngest justices ever to serve on the court, according to our Anita Kumar, Marc Caputo and Gabby Orr.\\n\\nCAN THE SENATE DO THAT? Yes, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Friday that Trump’s nominee will “receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.”\\n\\nBUT, BUT, BUT: Some vulnerable Senate Republicans want to hold off on a vote until after Election Day. Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine over the weekend said they oppose moving to fill Ginsburg’s seat immediately. And McConnell can afford to lose only three Republican votes, our Nolan D. McCaskill and Andrew Desiderio report.\\n\\nRETROSPECTIVE: “The Case That Helped Define Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s Gender Equality Fight,” from The Wall Street Journal\\n\\nGOOD MORNING.

Gavin Newsom’s administration, our Katy Murphy reports.\\n\\nThe Newsom administration released a report Saturday with additional recommendations for the state’s Employment Development Department, such as adopting a commercially available identity verification tool. The suggestions were crafted by a team tasked with reviewing the department\\'s aging IT systems.\\n\\nDepartment head Sharon Hilliard estimated that it will take until the end of January to get through the state’s current backlog. She said the agency \"is proactively looking at ways to reduce that timeline” and that if no changes were made the state “would still be working through the current backlog well into July 2021.”\\n\\nBut Hillard said Californians filing new claims will not actually see a delay in their benefit payments, and that many “will actually get their payments faster” thanks to the new identity verification process.\\n\\nOn the Hill\\n\\nWOLF GETS HEARING ON CAPITOL HILL: The Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee has penciled in a hearing Wednesday morning on Chad Wolf’s nomination to permanently lead the Department of Homeland Security.\\n\\nWolf, a former lobbyist, has served as the acting head of DHS since November of last year, and his confirmation would give the agency its first Senate-confirmed secretary since Kirstjen Nielsen resigned in April 2019.\\n\\nLegal questions about Wolf\\'s current role in the top spot at DHS will likely come up during the hearing. The Government Accountability Office found last month that he had been invalidly appointed to the role of acting secretary, the result of an improper line of succession.\\n\\nEEOC NOMINEES IN THE SENATE: McConnell filed cloture last week on a trio of nominees for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, meaning a full confirmation vote is likely this week.\\n\\nThe nominees are Keith Sonderling of DOL’s Wage and Hour Division and Andrea Lucas, to fill the roles of two Republican commissioners, and civil rights attorney Jocelyn Samuels, nominated for a Democratic seat on the commission.\\n\\nSTOPGAP VOTE THIS WEEK? House Democrats are hoping to file a stopgap spending bill by today that would keep the government open through Dec. 11, after congressional leaders missed a self-imposed deadline on Friday to strike a deal, our Caitlin Emma and John Bresnahan report.\\n\\nHouse leaders have said they want to vote this week on the continuing resolution, which would extend current government funding levels past Sept. 30 and give them more time to negotiate on a slate of fiscal 2021 spending bills.\\n\\nWHAT’S AT STAKE: “The measure would tee up a spending standoff during a lame-duck session of Congress, possibly in the middle of a presidential transition,” they write. But passing a dozen fiscal 2021 appropriations bills by Dec. 11 would still be a huge task, as the two parties “remain far apart on a broad swath of spending issues.”\\n\\nNOT TO MENTION... Congress still remains at an impasse over the next pandemic relief bill, and it’s unclear whether the House or Senate will approve a new tranche of aid before the election. Democrats want to pass at least $2.2 trillion in assistance, while the White House and Republicans are pressing for a lower price tag.\\n\\nRegulatory Corner\\n\\nDOL GIG WORKER RULE COMING SOON: The White House budget office has completed review of a DOL proposed rule that would clarify whether gig workers should be classified as employees or independent contractors. OMB wrapped up its review on Friday, meaning the text of the rulemaking should be published soon. The rule will be closely watched by app-based companies like Uber, Lyft and Doordash, as their workers are generally classified as independent contractors who aren’t protected under federal minimum wage and overtime laws.\\n\\nDON’T FORGET... The timing of the rule would make it vulnerable to repeal under the Congressional Review Act if Democrats were to win the White House and take control of the Senate. (Under that law, Congress can use a fast-track procedure to overturn a regulation issued within the prior 60 legislative days via simple majority votes.)\\n\\nUnemployment\\n\\nCOVID-19 SPIKES DON’T SHAKE LABOR MARKET: “Large states in the Northeast and West logged some of the highest unemployment rates in the nation in August, while many of their Southern and Midwestern neighbors saw lower rates of joblessness despite significant coronavirus outbreaks over the summer,” Kim Mackrael and Sarah Chaney report for The Wall Street Journal.\\n\\n“The jobless rate in more than half of states was below the national average of 8.4% in August,” they write, and “many of those states — including Arizona, South Carolina and Texas — recorded a surge in new coronavirus cases during the summer, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.”\\n\\nPopulation density also plays a role in state unemployment rates amid the pandemic, according to Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at the investment bank Jefferies LLC. “As people flee large cities, demand for services is declining further in those areas,” she told the Journal. Meanwhile, “states with large, higher-density cities, including California and Illinois, experienced elevated levels of unemployment in August,” Mackrael and Chaney report.\\n\\n2020 Watch\\n\\nCOMPUTER SCIENTISTS ENDORSE BIDEN: Two dozen award-winning computer scientists said on Friday that they were endorsing Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, citing the destructive impact of Trump’s immigration rules on the tech industry, Cade Metz reported for The New York Times.\\n\\n“The scientists, including John Hennessy, the executive chairman of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, are all winners of the Turing Award, which is often called the Nobel Prize of computing,” he writes. “Four of the scientists said the Trump administration’s restrictive immigration rules were a threat to computer research in the United States and could do long-term damage to the tech industry, which for decades has been one of the country’s economic engines.”\\n\\nComing up this week\\n\\nON TUESDAY: Congress’ Joint Economic Committee will hold a hearing at 2:30 p.m. titled, “The Economic Impact of America’s Failure to Contain the Coronavirus.”\\n\\nON WEDNESDAY: The House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration and citizenship will hold a hearing at 2 p.m. to discuss “immigrants as essential workers during COVID-19.”\\n\\nON THURSDAY: The Senate Aging Committee will hold a hearing at 9:30 p.m. on women and retirement to discuss “unique challenges and opportunities to pave a brighter future.”\\n\\nAt 10:30 a.m., the House Small Business Committee will hold a hearing on loan forgiveness, SBA Legacy Systems and inaccurate data related to the Paycheck Protection Program, in 2360 Rayburn.\\n\\nAt 2:30 p.m., the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on “Diversity in America: The Representation of People of Color in the Media.”\\n\\nON FRIDAY: The House Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on restaurants in America during the Covid-19 pandemic at 9 a.m.\\n\\nAt 9:30 a.m., a House Small Business subcommittee will hold a hybrid hearing to review PPP loan forgiveness.\\n\\nWhat We\\'re Reading\\n\\n— “CEOs Start to Place Big Bets as Pandemic Grinds On,” from The Wall Street Journal\\n\\n— “‘I’m so scared’: California nail salon workers face ruin as pandemic wears on,” from The San Francisco Chronicle\\n\\n— “United urges lawmakers back to the table on coronavirus aid,” from POLITICO\\n\\n— “No Job, Loads of Debt: Covid Upends Middle-Class Family Finances,” from The Wall Street Journal\\n\\n— “Housekeepers Face a Disaster Generations in the Making,” from The New York Times\\n\\n— “Trump at Minnesota rally: Biden will turn state into a ‘refugee camp,’’” from POLITICO\\n\\n— “I hired you because you’re Black.” from The Washington Post\\n\\n— “The new startup pitch: We’re not Uber,” from The San Francisco Chronicle\\n\\n— “Newly revealed USPS documents show an agency struggling to manage Trump, Amazon and the pandemic,” from The Washington Post\\n\\nTHAT’S ALL FOR MORNING SHIFT!\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter Rebecca Rainey @rebeccaarainey'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-playbook/2020/09/30/presidential-debate-chaos-in-cleveland-ice-to-launch-targeted-arrest-campaign-in-ca-covid-19-effects-disney-to-lay-off-28k-schwarzenegger-funds-voter-super-centers-newsoms-deadline-sign-or-veto-wine-country-fire-tragedies-anita-hills-hollywood-probe-490475', 'Full Text': 'Presidential debate: CHAOS in CLEVELAND — ICE to launch targeted arrest campaign in CA — Covid-19 effects: DISNEY to lay off 28K — SCHWARZENEGGER funds voter ‘super centers’ — NEWSOM’s deadline: Sign or veto Presented by The Great Courses Plus\\n\\nTHE BUZZ: It was chaos in Cleveland. A disaster. A dumpster fire. A train wreck.\\n\\nThat’s how the highly anticipated first presidential debate of 2020 will be remembered — a disorganized 90-plus-minute dogfight between former Vice President Joe Biden and a combative President Donald Trump, who insisted on repeated interruptions and left decorum on the wayside.\\n\\nAnd moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News also had a role in the disgrace, failing to get control for nearly the entire 90 minutes of the forum. The jaw-dropping turn of events had even veteran reporters agog. CNN’s Dana Bash gave the most accurate review of the night, live on air: “That was a s---show.”\\n\\nTHE BOTTOM LINE: “Trump mayhem takes over first debate,” by POLITICO’s David Siders: “The mayhem Donald Trump subjected Americans to on Tuesday might have helped him if Joe Biden had disintegrated. Biden didn’t. Trump — and viewers everywhere — just left the night worse off for having sat through the whole, weird thing.”\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump and Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden participate in the first presidential debate Tuesday, Sept. 29, 2020. | Olivier Douliery/Pool via AP\\n\\nBut there were some California-centric highlights:\\n\\nCRAZY CA: After saying he\\'s \"getting along very well with the governor\\'\\' in California, Trump said, \"I\\'m all for electric cars … but what they\\'ve done in California is just crazy.\\'\\' (A statement that came just days after Gavin Newsom signed an executive order mandating that sales of gas-powered cars and trucks will be phased out by 2035.)\\n\\nRAKING THOSE LEAVES: Asked about California wildfires, Trump said: \"The forest floors are loaded up with trees … and leaves and everything else.\" He added: “Every year I get the call, ‘California\\'s burning, California’s burning.’ If you had good forest management, you wouldn\\'t be getting those calls.” But as @CalMatters noted: “California only owns about 3% of the state\\'s forest. The largest landlord of forestland in California? The federal government.”\\n\\nON DEEP-BLUE CITIES: Also on Tuesday night, Trump said, \"Look at Oakland, look what happened in Oakland. … It was more violent than what I’m even seeing now,’’ and blamed Democratic-run cities. What Trump didn’t say: A federal officer was killed in May in Oakland during protests — allegedly by a member of the right-wing ‘boogaloo boys’ who used peaceful protests as a cover, the Washington Post’s Katie Shepherd reported.\\n\\nHEADLINE OF THE NIGHT: Trump refused to condemn white supremacy, instead saying, \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.\"\\n\\nKAMALA REACTS: “The president of the United States, in the year of our lord 2020, refuses to condemn white supremacists,’’ Kamala Harris told CNN’s Jake Tapper, post-debate.\\n\\nHOW THEY SAW IT:\\n\\nON THE GOP SIDE — Harmeet Dhillon, former vice chair of the California Republican Party and RNC member from CA: “One thing that was very striking to me … was how frequently Chris Wallace came to the aid of Joe Biden, how frequently he interrupted President Trump. … The president did a great job and repeating the successes of his administration and in reflecting those, and in really taking Joe Biden to task for his 47 years of not achieving.’’\\n\\nON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE — Amelia Matier, former consultant for Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and the Pete Buttigieg campaign: “There is no way anyone normal watched it all the way through. Biden looked like the adult in the room and Trump looked unhinged. Trump’s constant interruptions actually helped at a key moment when the moderator asked Biden about abolishing the filibuster and packing the court — Biden didn’t have to answer the question.”\\n\\nLOCAL ANGLE: “Oaklanders angry at Trump\\'s accusation of \\'violent\\' Oakland,’’ by SFGATE’s Amy Graff.\\n\\nFROM THE TWITTERSPHERE:\\n\\n— Stockton Mayor @MichaelDTubbs: “The fact that the President thinks hating racism is the same as hating America is deeply telling of who he is and why he is not fit to lead a multi-racial democracy.”\\n\\n— Warriors phenom @StephenCurry30: “Stand back and stand by??????????? No further questions your honor! #vote”\\n\\n— GOP consultant and former Schwarzenegger spokesperson @RobStutzman: “Why would anyone watch two more of these debates?\\n\\n— Former CA first lady @MariaShriver: “I came into tonight excited and hopeful to see this debate and I have to say I\\'m flabbergasted that was a presidential debate. I\\'m dismayed by what I saw. #PresidentialDebate”\\n\\nBUENOS DÍAS, good Wednesday morning. It’s the final day for Gov. Gavin Newsom to sign or veto bills. Among the measures we’re still waiting on: a hotly contested bill requiring hotel and hospitality businesses to prioritize rehiring workers laid off during the pandemic.\\n\\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: \"The events surrounding Cambridge Analytica are now impossible. … It is just simply no longer possible for that to happen on Facebook.\" Former British deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg — now Facebook’s vice president for global affairs and communications — when asked by POLITICO if a similar data-gathering operation could take place on the platform.\\n\\nTWEET OF THE DAY: Former California Gov. Arnold @Schwarzenegger after he logged on to a local meeting in Cameron County, Texas to announce his first grant from the University of Southern California’s Schwarzenegger Institute to open more polling places nationwide: “Thank you to Cameron County for applying for a grant! I am so pumped for the voters to have access to these voting super-centers. Like I said, I owe this country everything and this is one of my best investments.”\\n\\nBONUS TOTD: George Takei @GeorgeTakei: “Eric Trump saying he’s ‘part of the LGBT’ community is like me saying I’m part of the fantasy football community. I might think I know what a ‘tight end’ and a ‘wide receiver’ are, but I would be sorely mistaken.”\\n\\nWHERE’S GAVIN?

Democrats are planning on throwing a few wrenches into the process, as our Andrew Desiderio reports, but the delay tactics won’t prevent Barrett from being sworn in. Her confirmation hearing, which will last three to four days, will begin Oct. 12, setting the stage for a possible floor vote before Election Day.\\n\\nJudge Amy Coney Barrett listens as President Donald Trump announces Barrett as his nominee to the Supreme Court, Saturday, Sept. 26, 2020, in Washington. | AP Photo/Alex Brandon\\n\\nBarrett has already ruled on Trump’s immigration policies during her time on the appeals court. In June, she was the lone judge to dissent in a decision blocking Trump’s public charge rule, which was written to make it harder for immigrants who rely on Medicaid, food stamps and other programs to get green cards and visas. On Sept. 11, another appeals court issued a decision that cleared the Trump administration to implement the rule nationwide.\\n\\nIn 2017, Barrett voted against a request for a rehearing in the discrimination case EEOC v. AutoZone, joining four other judges in denying the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s request for the full court to reconsider the case, in which the EEOC alleged the auto parts store was segregating its employees by race.\\n\\nShe also joined in a 2019 ruling that said the 1967 Age Discrimination in Employment Act only covers current employees, not job applicants. The Supreme Court last year declined to take up the case, leaving the 7th Circuit’s ruling in place.

But “lenders that helped the government deliver the money are warning that the effort is running into new delays and complications that could leave struggling employers on the hook with unanticipated debt,” our Zachary Warmbodt reports.\\n\\nBanks have been submitting applications for loan forgiveness to the Small Business Administration since Aug. 10, “but the lenders say the agency has been silent on whether any of the applications will be accepted,” Zach writes. The SBA said Thursday it has received 96,000 forgiveness applications — representing fewer than 2 percent of the total loans — but has not approved or denied any of them.\\n\\nWHAT’S THE HOLDUP? Banks say they have gotten conflicting information from various SBA officials, according to Zach. “Another concern that has surprised borrowers as well as some lenders is a requirement that the proceeds from a separate SBA disaster aid program must be deducted from the amount of the payroll loan that can be forgiven. That means many businesses will likely be left with money to pay back to their bank.”\\n\\nImmigration\\n\\nDHS PROPOSES LIMITS ON STUDENT VISAS: The Department of Homeland Security is proposing putting two- and four-year limits on visas for international students, who are currently allowed to stay in the U.S. for as long as it takes to complete their programs, our Eleanor Mueller reports. The Trump administration argues the existing system has \"undermined\" its ability to crack down on students’ \"unlawful presence\" and has \"created incentives for fraud and abuse.”\\n\\nHow it would work: “The time limit would depend on a student\\'s country of origin,” Eleanor writes. “Most would get four years. But a two-year limit would be imposed on those hailing from countries with visa overstay rates of more than 10 percent, including several dozen nations located mostly in Africa and the Middle East. A two-year limit would also apply to students from countries the U.S. considers state sponsors of terrorism, including Iran, North Korea, Syria or Sudan.”\\n\\nWhat now: The public has 30 days to comment on the proposed changes, and immigration advocates are already criticizing the proposal.\\n\\nOn the Hill\\n\\nBANKRUPTCY BILL MARKUP THIS WEEK: The House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday afternoon will mark up a bill that seeks to strengthen protections for workers during business bankruptcies.

U.S. intelligence agencies later blamed that breach on a covert Kremlin effort to torpedo the Democratic nominee and help Trump win.\\n\\nBut security researchers, former intelligence officials and lawmakers now worry that the Russians may still have a hand they haven’t played.\\n\\n“One thing we know that happened in 2016 was Russia, particularly with misinformation and disinformation, tried to exacerbate those divisions that we see play out in real time in America,” Senate Intelligence Vice Chair Mark Warner (D-Va.) told an audience at a cybersecurity conference last week. “I’m very, very concerned in these last 50-plus days whether Russia could try to exacerbate those kinds of racial divisions again.”\\n\\nIn some ways, Russia’s job is easier than it was in 2016. American, Chinese and Iranian copycats are now pumping out falsehoods likely to seed the same divisions and doubts about the legitimacy of the election, often mimicking tactics first deployed by the Kremlin.\\n\\nAnd the biggest threat this year may be Americans themselves. Many have embraced a deluge of fringe ideas and misinformation to a degree that may dwarf those foreign efforts. Extremists in the U.S. have adopted much of Moscow’s online strategy, including creating fake online personas to pump out falsehoods. Case in point: The QAnon conspiracy theory, which alleges a plot by elite pedophiles and the “deepstate” to overthrow Trump, has gone so mainstream it’s poised to send adherents to Congress.\\n\\n“The scale, scope and, most importantly, the impact of domestic disinformation is far greater than any foreign government could do to the United States,” said Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, which tracks online influence campaigns — and was itself the victim of recent Russian cyberattacks.\\n\\n“Russia is continuing to evolve its tactics,” he added. “But the playing field has shifted since 2016.”\\n\\nWorst-case scenarios\\n\\nThe question of what exactly Russia is up to has spawned a political brawl in Washington, where congressional Democrats have accused the Trump administration of failing to disclose all it knows about the Kremlin’s activities. They also say the president is pushing a false narrative that this year’s most potent election threat comes from China, which Trump contends favors Biden. Intelligence officials have told POLITICO that no evidence backs up those claims.\\n\\nStill, Trump’s top counterintelligence official, William Evanina, has agreed that Moscow is seeking to attack the election. He told lawmakers last month that Russia aims to “denigrate” Biden “and what it sees as an anti-Russia ‘establishment.” Those efforts — plus influence campaigns by China and Iran — are \"a direct threat to the fabric of our democracy,\" he said in an earlier statement.\\n\\nLast week, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on four individuals, including Andrii Derkach, a Ukrainian lawyer with ties to Trump, accusing them of being active Russian agents. In particular, the U.S. accused Derkach of leaking doctored audiotapes aimed at discrediting Biden.\\n\\n“The United States will continue to use all the tools at its disposal to counter these Russian disinformation campaigns,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Still, social media posts about those recordings have drawn millions of views among mostly Trump supporters after the president and his allies promoted them, The Associated Press reported Saturday.\\n\\nTen U.S. and international national security officials, misinformation experts and tech executives who spoke to POLITICO said their major concerns include a hack of either campaign coming to light only days before Nov. 3. Most spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss national security matters.\\n\\nThat would mirror not only the months of anti-Clinton leaks from 2016, but also the run-up to France’s 2017 presidential election, when Russian hackers released reams of internal documents from Emmanuel Macron’s campaign.\\n\\nNo such leaks have yet been made public in this election. Senior U.S. national security and intelligence officials say they also have seen no new Russian efforts to hack the nation’s election infrastructure, such as voting machines, election device vendors and state voter databases.\\n\\nBut officials warned that Moscow is engaging in information warfare through a combination of attempted social media manipulation, old school propaganda and other dirty tricks.\\n\\nConspiracy theories like QAnon and racial divisions stoked by right-wing extremists online appear to be making it more difficult for Russia’s direct campaigns to gain massive followings, with recently exposed Kremlin efforts garnering limited traction with social media users.\\n\\nBut if Moscow still intends to try to weaken the U.S. by generating doubt around the election itself, such homegrown falsehoods would help achieve that goal, according to misinformation experts.\\n\\nMoscow forced to evolve\\n\\nAnother change from 2016: Tougher oversight by social media companies and increased awareness from U.S. security agencies about Russia’s tactics have forced the Kremlin’s operatives to step up their game.\\n\\nBefore the 2016 election, the Internet Research Agency — a St. Petersburg-based propaganda outfit with ties to the Russian government — was able to buy political ads on Facebook, some of them in rubles, and create fake social media profiles that drew widespread followings around posts on both sides of issues like America’s racial divisions and the country’s treatment of immigrants.\\n\\nBut some of those doors have closed.\\n\\nAfter receiving widespread criticism for their 2016 failings, Facebook, Twitter and Google’s YouTube have spent the past two years removing millions of misleading posts and so-called bot networks of fake accounts controlled by Russian operatives. They have also limited the ways Kremlin-owned media outlets can spread their messages online.\\n\\nOn Sept. 1, Facebook and Twitter announced their latest attempts at curbing Russia’s influence by removing a handful of accounts and social media pages linked to an Internet Research Agency campaign to target progressive voters with a fake news website that pumped out left-leaning articles.\\n\\nSeeking to evade the hunt for fake accounts, the IRA used artificial intelligence to create photos of non-existent people, then built social media personas with those images to push news articles to left-minded online groups, the two companies said. Most strikingly, the IRA also hired freelance journalists to write for a bogus online news outlet called PeaceData that promoted causes favored by Russia, such as attacks on Belarus’ opposition leader, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, and U.S. foreign policy toward Venezuela.\\n\\nThe elaborate tactics highlight how much harder it has become for Russia’s misinformation campaigns to reach Americans on social media, said Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Graphika, an analytics firm that worked with Facebook on the recent takedown.\\n\\nBut even the new methods did not guarantee success. PeaceData’s English-language social media presence, for instance, failed to gain traction in the U.S. before it was outed as a Kremlin front, garnering just 200 followers after creating its Facebook page in mid-May.\\n\\n“If you’re running a fake operation, trying to achieve success when you don’t have any real friends is tough,” said Nimmo, who has tracked the IRA’s activities for years. “The underlying reality is that it’s harder to conduct a successful campaign than you may think.”\\n\\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) allegedly promoting anti-Israeli causes from other accounts. They also posted incendiary slogans and calls-for-action on both sides of issues like Black Lives Matter and garnered almost 250,000 followers collectively before the accounts were shut down.\\n\\nIn March, Facebook and Twitter also took down a similar Russian-backed campaign that tricked unsuspecting social media users in Ghana to target African Americans in the U.S. with viral posts depicting police brutality against minorities, including an image of officers allegedly arresting a 6-year-old boy, and calling Trump a racist.\\n\\nMost of that content was not linked to the 2020 election, according to a review of the fake online content by Graphika. But tech executives and misinformation experts said the campaign had been aimed at building an online following that could then switch to more explicit political content closer to November.\\n\\n“These types of operations are getting caught earlier and before they have an impact compared to what happened in the past,” said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy. Then again, he added, “The threat actors will keep on innovating.”\\n\\n\\'Russia doesn’t need to be successful in everything\\'\\n\\nWith weeks left before November’s vote, Russia is not limiting itself to covert tactics.\\n\\nOver the past two months, the Kremlin has used its extensive state media operations like RT and Sputnik to pump out political messages to both progressive voters and Trump supporters, according to a POLITICO review of these outlets\\' social media activities.\\n\\nSince the beginning of the Democratic National Convention in mid-August, for instance, the Kremlin-backed outlets published articles and op-eds attacking Biden for policies like his support for the Iraq War, and claimed that Barack Obama expressed doubt that his former running mate could win the presidency.\\n\\nThose stories collectively reached thousands of online users, according to a review of activity on CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned tool that analyzes people’s engagement on social media. That represents a fraction of the reach of traditional news outlets’ coverage of the convention, but still allowed Russia to get its message to social media users across the U.S.\\n\\nThe Kremlin’s aim was to sow doubts in the minds of progressive voters, particularly those who had initially backed Bernie Sanders, about whether Biden was worth supporting, said Bret Schafer, a media and digital disinformation fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States\\' Alliance for Securing Democracy, a think tank in Washington.\\n\\nThe Marshall Fund was one of more than 200 organizations, businesses and people targeted by Russia’s recent hacking efforts, Microsoft said last week.\\n\\n“It’s a quintessential voter suppression campaign,” Schafer added.\\n\\nA week later, just as the Republican convention was getting underway, the same Russian media outlets began peddling articles to promote Trump’s unsubstantiated claims that mail-in voter fraud was a widespread problem. Kremlin operatives have been pushing similar pro-Trump messages about voter fraud since at least March, according to an intelligence bulletin from the Department of Homeland Security obtained by ABC News.\\n\\nThat message has continued into September, with articles from RT and Sputnik promoting mail-in fraud accusations garnering, collectively, thousands of comments and shares across social media, according to POLITICO’s analysis of CrowdTangle data.\\n\\n“What we’re seeing in the U.S. is what Russia has done elsewhere,” said a veteran European national security official, who has tracked the Kremlin’s disinformation activities across multiple elections worldwide since 2016. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the individual was not authorized to speak publicly on security matters linked to Russia.\\n\\n“The key is that Russia doesn’t need to be successful in everything that it does,” the official added. “Just the fact that it’s pushing these falsehoods can be enough to muddy the waters before an election.”\\n\\nNatasha Bertrand and Martin Matishak contributed to this report.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-york-playbook/2020/09/11/new-fines-for-mask-violators-on-public-transit-9-11-commemorations-altered-by-pandemic-business-leaders-press-de-blasio-on-quality-of-life-490304', 'Full Text': 'New fines for mask violators on public transit — 9/11 commemorations altered by pandemic — Business leaders press de Blasio on quality of life Presented by Uber\\n\\nSubway riders must mask up or face a $50 fine starting Monday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the MTA said . The bid to increase enforcement comes as more and more of the city opens up, but New Yorkers have remained markedly leery of returning to the subway, with post-Labor Day ridership still down more than 70 percent compared to last year.\\n\\nRestoring confidence in mass transit during a pandemic has proven to be a tricky proposition, as more straphangers turn to cars and the cash-strapped transit authority contemplates massive cuts that could alienate even more riders. There are overnight closures to clean and disinfect cars, but experts point out that contaminated surfaces are not the main risk for catching the coronavirus — instead, it’s lots of people packed into enclosed spaces. So there’s a bit of a paradox here: the emptier the subways are, the safer they are, the more people feel safe enough to take them, the riskier they may become. But most experts agree that compliance with mask requirements is key to keeping riders safe, while the MTA understands that perception is part of its problem.\\n\\nMasks have been required on subways and buses since April, and the MTA says 90 percent of riders are already following the rules — though the transit workers union and journalists have reported much lower compliance on certain routes. “This is targeting a small population of folks who are refusing to wear a mask,” New York City Transit President Sarah Feinberg said. “Even if it’s just one or two people in the system, they do not have the right to endanger anyone else. And frankly, they don’t have the right to scare anyone away from the system.”\\n\\nThe new penalties, which will also apply on LIRR and MetroNorth, follow an order from Cuomo to boost mask-wearing compliance. Still, it’s not yet clear just how rigorous the latest enforcement blitz will be. The MTA says it will not direct transit workers to issue fines, and will instead rely on MTA police and the NYPD, which stopped giving summonses months ago for failures to wear a mask, and has itself been the subject of frequent complaints about police officers not covering their faces.\\n\\nIT’S FRIDAY and the 19th anniversary of 9/11.

Attending the 9/11 commemoration ceremony.\\n\\nABOVE THE FOLD: “IN A YEAR when the coronavirus pandemic has reshaped countless American rituals, even the commemoration of 9/11 could not escape unchanged. The 19th anniversary of the terror attacks will be marked by dueling ceremonies at the Sept. 11 memorial plaza and a corner near the World Trade Center, reflecting a divide over the memorial’s decision to suspend a cherished tradition of relatives reading victims’ names in person. Vice President Mike Pence is expected at both those remembrances in New York, and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden at the observance on the memorial plaza....In New York, the double beams of light that evoke the fallen twin towers were nearly canceled in the name of virus safety, until an uproar restored the tribute. The Fire Department has cited the virus in urging members to stay away from any observances of the 2001 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people, among them almost 350 firefighters. Some victims’ relatives say they understand the ground zero observance had to change in a year when so much else has. Others fear the pandemic is making plain what they have feared was happening unspoken: that the commitment to ‘Never Forget’ is fading.” The Associated Press’ Jennifer Peltz\\n\\n— 9/11 responder groups are pitching in to help essential workers with protective equipment and food during the pandemic.\\n\\n— “Coronavirus attacked more stealthily, spreading almost unnoticed until suddenly, it seemed to have the entire city in its grip. It eclipsed the 9/11 death toll in early April. Now, the comparison is not even close. As of September 9, coronavirus has killed almost nine times as many people in New York City (23,741) as the World Trade Center attacks (2,753). And while the terror attacks crippled the city’s economy, the economic fallout pales in comparison to 2020.” NY1’s Bobby Cuza\\n\\n— “[T]he attack on the World Trade Center created a definitive physical scar — a hole in the ground, a space in the skyline — from which the city could rebound and rally around.

Chief executives of companies like Goldman Sachs, Vornado Realty Trust and JetBlue sent a letter to the mayor portraying a bleak assessment of life in New York City during the pandemic, and suggesting a vote of no confidence in the mayor’s ability to correct it. The letter asserted that there was ‘widespread anxiety over public safety, cleanliness and other quality of life issues that are contributing to deteriorating conditions in commercial districts and neighborhoods across the five boroughs.’ And if the mayor did not address those issues, the business leaders warned that people who have left the city would be slow to return because of legitimate concerns over ‘security and the livability of our communities.’” New York Times’ Emma G. Fitzsimmons and Dana Rubinstein\\n\\nTHE LEGAL AID Society is preparing to sue the de Blasio administration over its plan to move homeless New Yorkers with disabilities out of an accessible shelter in Midtown so it can make room for the homeless men the mayor kicked out of the Lucerne Hotel on the Upper West Side, the group said Thursday. The Harmonia shelter on 31st Street is a family facility where 80 percent of the people it serves have disabilities. In order to accommodate those moved out of the Lucerne, residents at the Harmonia will be scattered to other shelters around the city, the legal advocacy group said. POLITICO’s Janaki Chadha\\n\\n— “‘My husband and I are in wheelchairs, okay? And I’m on oxygen,’ said Glenda Harris, 56, who has lived at the Harmonia since February 2018. ‘Last minute, they tell us we have to leave,’ Harris exasperatedly told the Daily News .

About an hour later, he said Cuomo’s office informed City Hall that they planned to go ahead with an announcement without him. It’s the latest disagreement between the two rival pols on how to manage the coronavirus pandemic… Cuomo cleared indoor restaurants to reopen on Sept. 30 with 25 percent of their usual tables...

While this plan, offered during a unique opportunity to rethink city street use, did not go as far as many public officials and advocates would have liked, it was a significant move by a mayor who has paid limited attention to the city’s buses, ridden by about 388,000 people, mostly low-income people of color, each weekday before the pandemic hit.

And 435,000 of them will need to submit an additional certification to qualify for the $300. ‘We are emailing all New Yorkers who are receiving benefits to inform them of their status and, if needed, provide information about certifying for the Lost Wages Assistance program,’ labor commissioner Roberta Reardon said in a statement.” USA Today Network’s Joseph Spector\\n\\n“NEW YORK’S new online system for obtaining absentee ballots received more than 220,000 requests in its first week — about half of all absentee ballots sought during the entire 2016 presidential campaign, according to the state Board of Elections.

But those plans were scrapped a week before schools opened — not on account of the new coronavirus, but because of a reduction in state funding. The City School District of Albany voted late on Tuesday to lay off 222 employees and scrap plans to offer in-person instruction to students in grades 7 to 12. The sudden change frustrated parents and teachers in the district, who said they feared recent immigrants, refugees and other at-risk students would be adversely affected. Albany’s layoffs were some of the first direct fallout from Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s administration withholding $300 million in aid from districts across New York over the summer as the state grapples with a $14.5 billion deficit that stems in large part from the coronavirus pandemic.

The payments were authorized and made by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which oversees the program. But instead of sending the funds to the city, the agency started keeping some of the money.” New York Daily News’ Michael McCauliff\\n\\n“A FEDERAL COURT ruled Thursday that President Trump’s order to exclude undocumented immigrants from census numbers for apportioning congressional districts is unlawful. A unanimous three-judge panel for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York said in its decision that Trump\\'s executive memorandum violates the executive branch\\'s ‘constitutional responsibility to count the whole number of persons in each State and to apportion members of the House of Representatives among the States according to their respective numbers.’” The Hill’s Harper Neidig\\n\\n— “New York City is racing against the clock to count as many residents as possible for the U.S. Census, raising fears that a significant slice of the population will be left unaccounted for, costing the city crucial federal resources for the next decade.”\\n\\n... 2020 VISION ...\\n\\nMINOR PARTIES have long enjoyed a uniquely significant role in the state’s political process, thanks in part to fusion voting. But because of a new law that came about after years of feuding between Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the Working Families Party, those parties could be relegated to irrelevance after November\\'s election. They are all scrambling to ensure that doesn\\'t happen. The rules governing minor parties have been pretty straightforward since the 1930s: If they got 50,000 votes in a gubernatorial election, they enjoyed four years’ worth of perks such as looser campaign finance limits, automatic ballot status in statewide races and special elections, and state-funded primaries. Now, they’ll need to hit a total of either 130,000 votes or 2 percent of the electorate, whichever is higher. They’ll need to hit this mark in every presidential and gubernatorial contest, instead of just the gubernatorial one.

MINORITY LEADER Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) denounced the Republican’s much-ballyhooed ‘skinny’ economic relief bill on Thursday for abandoning New York’s mass transit and their ridership during a fiscal and health crisis unseen for nearly a century. Schumer angrily decried the GOP for giving a legislative middle finger to the Metropolitan Transit Authority and other mass transit systems, which have experienced catastrophic declines in ridership during the pandemic. ‘The Republican bill flatlined New York, it flatlined the MTA, it flatlined the working people who ride public transportation every day,’ Schumer told the News.

As you may have noticed, almost everything kind of sucks.\\n\\nThe U.S. budget deficit tripled this year to $3.3 trillion, by far the highest ever. The U.S. economy shrank at a 31.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter, by far the worst ever. The trade deficit is at its highest level in 12 years. Consumer confidence is at its lowest level in six years. Unemployment claims, which had never topped 700,000 in a week before March, have topped 700,000 every week since March. Farm bankruptcies are rising, even though government payments to farmers are at an all-time high. Homicides are rising in America’s cities after decades of decline, while a series of police killings of unarmed Black Americans has triggered anguished protests and civil unrest. The West Coast is on fire, and 2020 may turn out to be the hottest year in recorded history. America’s reputation abroad is the worst it’s been since the Pew Research Center began doing international surveys.\\n\\nIn related news, a virus that has already killed 200,000 Americans is still spreading in much of the country, even though it’s mostly under control in most of the rest of the world. Now the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, less than two months before an election that was already inflaming some rather scary tensions, has created a potential constitutional crisis, while President Donald Trump is refusing to commit to a peaceful transition of power if he loses the election to Joe Biden.\\n\\nVoters are already starting to vote, and the president is already proclaiming that the election is going to be riddled with fraud, which is not so awesome.\\n\\nOn the other hand … let’s see ... Hamilton is streaming on Disney Plus?\\n\\nIt was back in 2014 that I wrote an essay for the new year called “Everything Is Awesome,” after Republicans won a landslide in the midterm elections by proclaiming that everything was awful, the economy was collapsing, and an Ebola pandemic was about to kill us all. In fact, the economy was growing at an impressive rate, Ebola ended up killing a grand total of two Americans, and statistically, just about everything was getting better, which is why I stole the title of The Lego Movie’s theme song to highlight the vast gap between the rhetoric and reality. I wrote new versions of the essay every year, my dorky way of trying to add some holiday cheer to a gloomy political culture. Politics changed dramatically in the next few years, with Donald Trump describing America as a dystopian hellscape as a candidate and then as the most spectacular economy ever as president, but the statistical trajectory barely changed at all.\\n\\nThe January 2019 installment was a bit less upbeat, and included a warning that “this might be the final edition of this holiday tradition.” The economy was still pretty fabulous—highest consumer confidence in two decades, lowest unemployment in five decades—but it just felt like America was “slouching toward non-awesomeness,” like “things are going to reach some kind of breaking point.” The headline was “Yes, 2019 Is the Year You Were Worrying About.”\\n\\nSue me, I was off by a year.\\n\\nThe main point of the Awesome tradition was never about politics. It was about gratitude, about our inability to count our blessings. It was a data-driven version of the Louis C.K. riff that “everything is amazing and nobody is happy.” It felt important to document the objective improvements in our national well-being, in light of our national tendency to kvetch about spotty airplane Wi-Fi instead of appreciating the miracle of flight. Most Americans now view the state of the union through a partisan lens, as if economic growth under a president you don’t like isn’t really growth. But statistics, and well-being, ought to be apolitical.\\n\\nUnfortunately, now that things are no longer amazing—even Louis C.K. was cancelled—and the election is coming soon, it’s hard to avoid the political implications of our national nightmare. After making a thriving America sound like it was on the brink of death in 2016, Trump is now making a bleeding America sound like it’s only got a flesh wound in 2020. He’s arguing that Covid-19 is under control when it’s still killing 1,000 Americans every day, that the economy is an incredible comeback story when it has shed 11.5 million jobs this year—and, rather perversely, that whatever mayhem might be erupting on his watch only illustrates the dangers of Joe Biden’s America.\\n\\nUsually, when presidents run for reelection, the key question is whether Americans are better off than they were four years earlier. In 1984, 1996 and 2012, the answers under Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Obama were clear yeses; in 1980, America told Jimmy Carter hell no; 1992 and 2004 were closer calls, with George H.W. Bush losing but George W. Bush winning. The electoral landscape of 2020 looks a lot less straightforward, and a lot more frightening.\\n\\nPresidents inevitably take too much credit for the good stuff that happens while they’re in the White House, and their critics inevitably assign them too much blame for the bad stuff. But since this series always focused on the stuff itself, rather than the spin about the stuff—and since Trump rose to power as one of those finger-pointing critics—it seems like a moment to take stock of where we were and where we are one last time, now that the stuff has hit the fan.\\n\\nLet’s start with the good stuff, because there is some.\\n\\nThe strength of the stock market, for example, reflects genuine investor confidence in the U.S. economy, or at least in the big businesses that make up the major exchanges. It doesn’t necessarily reflect confidence in the U.S. president, even though this one brags about it all the time; the Dow nearly tripled under President Barack Obama, while it’s up less than 50 percent under Trump. But the positive trend line has continued in the Trump era, despite some wild volatility evocative of the man himself, and while it’s true the current bull market reflects the Federal Reserve’s hyperaggressive interventions to extend credit to corporate behemoths during the pandemic, that’s a good thing, too. America’s central bank has done an awesome job propping up the economy, despite frequent norm-busting complaints from Trump that it wasn’t propping it up aggressively enough, and at a time when confidence in so many elite institutions is hemorrhaging, it’s a relief that the smart money still trusts the Fed.\\n\\nOne difficulty with assessing good stuff that’s happened in the past four years is that Trump tends to exaggerate its goodness to ludicrous proportions, while concocting an alternative reality about how horrific things were before it. But good stuff is still good. For example, the “New NAFTA” trade deal that Trump negotiated with Mexico and Canada looks a lot like the old NAFTA, which Trump routinely bashed as the worst trade deal in history. But it did include some modest concessions from Mexico on labor issues and from Canada on dairy issues—as did Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Trump scuttled, but still—and it averted the disastrous trade war that Trump had vowed to launch if it didn’t pass. The new U.S.-Korea trade deal also looks a lot like Obama’s U.S.-Korea trade deal that Trump had blamed for hundreds of thousands of lost jobs, but it could help American carmakers get slightly better access to the Korean market, and the major stakeholders all seem fine with the outcome, compared with a descent into protectionism.\\n\\nSimilarly, Trump hyped the recent news that the Gulf states United Arab Emirates and Bahrain are establishing full diplomatic relations with Israel as huge steps towards peace in the Middle East, when they are quite small steps—and after Trump was captured on tape bragging to Bob Woodward that he had shielded the Gulf state Saudi Arabia from scrutiny after the murder of a Washington Post journalist, it’s understandable that some critics are skeptical about U.S. motivations. But small steps are still steps. And speaking of small steps, while Trump doesn’t talk much about criminal justice reform these days—he talks about unleashing the criminal justice system on anti-police-brutality protesters and other political opponents—the bipartisan First Step Act he signed into law was a genuine first step away from mass incarceration.\\n\\nThe dark clouds above us these days tend to overshadow the silver linings, but that doesn’t mean the Silver Linings genre of good news is fake news. For example, the climate emergency is real, constantly fueling new fires and storms and temperature records, but the clean energy revolution that can help alleviate the emergency is also real. Three-quarters of the world’s new electricity generation last year was renewable, and the U.S. has now retired 60 percent of its coal plants in a decade; despite Trump’s aggressive efforts to boost the coal industry, it’s been vanishing even faster on his watch than it did on Obama’s. And the oil industry has written off $90 billion in assets this year—partly because of the unfortunate coronavirus-related drop in short-term demand, but partly because it senses a greener long-term future ahead.\\n\\nIt’s even possible to see a few upsides in the coronavirus catastrophe, if you squint. There will probably be much less unnecessary business travel and much more part-time telecommuting now that the world has learned how to Zoom; it also might be the end of school cancellations on school days, which is good news for parents, if not for students. And as corny as it sounds, the disruptions and lockdowns of the past six months have helped clarify what is and isn’t important in life, helping a lot of us appreciate ordinary things we might have taken for granted in the past.\\n\\nIncluding the United States of America. Even in these non-awesome times, a lot of us still have a lot to be thankful for. Inflation remains low. There hasn’t been a run on the dollar even though our government has printed unprecedented quantities of dollars. Supermarkets are stocked, and you can get just about anything you want delivered tomorrow with a single click. This may not be a great moment for public health or public safety, for our climate or our democracy, but we’re not Venezuela or Belarus or Somalia or Bangladesh.\\n\\nWhich is, let’s face it, a low bar to clear for the nation that’s supposed to be the beacon to the world. Enough with the gratitude. Let’s get to the suckitude.\\n\\n“Great Jobs Numbers!” Trump tweeted after the U.S. economy added 1.4 million jobs in August. Unemployment had dropped to 8.4 percent, its first time below double digits since April. “Wow, much better than expected!” the president declared.\\n\\nYeah, well, the Portland Trail Blazers did better than expected against the Los Angeles Lakers, but they still lost four out of five games. Businesses have rehired some of the workers they laid off this spring, but overall, the U.S. economy has still lost more jobs in 2020 than were lost in the entire Great Recession. There are more Americans receiving food stamps than there were before Trump took office, even though his administration has made it harder to qualify, and food pantries have still faced unprecedented demand. Foreign travel to the U.S. may fall by more than half this year, while Americans still aren’t even allowed to travel to most foreign countries.\\n\\nThat’s not great, and the numbers would look even worse if Congress hadn’t deployed the national credit card to provide $4 trillion worth of economic relief this spring. Congress could make the numbers look better by pumping even more stimulus into the economy, and the Democratic House did pass a $3 trillion bill to bail out cash-strapped states and families in May, but the Republican Senate has yet to pass anything. Gridlock rules in Washington, which is also not great. State and local governments are hemorrhaging cash. As the president likes to say: Sad!\\n\\nTrump and his surrogates keep suggesting the pandemic-induced recession shouldn’t really count toward his economic record, because he had turned a stagnant economy into the greatest economy in American history before COVID-19 temporarily interrupted all the winning. In fact, the economy was growing at a decent rate and adding 200,000 jobs a month before he became president; it continued to grow and add jobs at a similar rate in the first three years of his presidency. The manufacturing sector that he promised to revive actually slipped into recession before the pandemic—and the number of Americans without health insurance, which had declined by 20 million during the Obama years, had risen by more than 2 million under Trump. Still, it’s true that unemployment, which had dropped to 4.7 percent by the end of Obama’s second term, kept dropping to 3.5 percent under Trump until the virus began wreaking havoc.\\n\\nIn any case, the virus absolutely counts. The countries that did what they needed to do to control it—like New Zealand and Taiwan and Germany and even Canada next door—now have their daily death count down to single digits and their economies more or less back. The United States didn’t, so we don’t. We didn’t launch a massive public health campaign with on-demand testing, vigorous contract tracing, mandatory quarantines and universal mask-wearing. It’s telling that the National Basketball Association did all those things inside its Orlando bubble, and none of its personnel have gotten the virus during the playoffs, but the rest of the country hasn’t followed its lead, so our daily deaths are in the quadruple digits. Trump thinks that’s got nothing to do with him, but the leaders of the nations that beat the virus didn’t downplay it as an ordinary flu that would miraculously go away, or hold indoor rallies for unmasked fans, or pressure state and local officials to open schools and businesses, or cheer on protesters who screamed that coronavirus mandates were tyranny. And those leaders had plans.\\n\\nThe economic numbers today are obviously better than they were in April, after the virus vaporized 20 million jobs, but when you’re only halfway out of a hole, you’re still in a hole. And when we do climb out—assuming we eventually do contain the virus—we’ll have to confront some troubling statistical hangovers. It’s appropriate to borrow and spend during a downturn, but it’s still unnerving that the national debt will be bigger than the economy next year for the first time since World War II. The Highway Trust Fund is projected for insolvency in 2022, the Medicare trust fund perhaps as early as 2023, and the Social Security retirement fund by 2031, which could inspire demands for fiscal austerity that could drag down the recovery. The Fed’s aggressive monetary stimulus has also been appropriate in tough times, but its balance sheet has ballooned above $6 trillion, up 700 percent since 2007, with no plan to unwind it.\\n\\nFor now, though, the virus is still the overarching economic problem, because the recovery will keep sputtering as long as it’s mucking up the engine. Of course, it’s also a health problem, with more than 7 million Americans already infected, and a child development problem, especially for low-income kids who rely on school lunches for nutrition and have trouble logging into online classes.\\n\\nIn other suboptimal news, 2020 is already the worst wildfire season in the history of California, burning more than 3.4 million acres of the state; the same is true for Oregon, which had the world’s worst air quality last week. Some Westerners now need to wear masks indoors, too. Meanwhile, the beleaguered National Hurricane Center tracked five Atlantic cyclones at once last week for the first time in half a century; it’s had to deal with so many named storms this year that it ran out of letters in the alphabet to name them, and has started using the Greek alphabet. This is the new abnormal on a warmer planet, where we’ll keep having to add words like “firenado” and “derecho” to our weather vocabularies. Trump insists the world is about to start getting cooler—“Just watch. I don’t think science knows, actually”—but according to every serious projection, he’s wrong. Carbon emissions will decrease this year because of the pandemic, but that just means the earth will heat up at a slightly slower pace—and all those wildfires are not only blasting forest carbon into the atmosphere now, they’re reducing the capacity of forests to store carbon in the future.\\n\\nAs if things weren’t hunky-dory enough in 2020, the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other unarmed African-Americans have sparked mass protests and counterprotests that have escalated America’s political culture wars into indelible moments of chaos, from the killing of protesters in Kenosha by a white suburban teenager to the tear-gassing of protesters in Washington so Trump could pose in front of a vandalized church to the riots and looting in Chicago. The whole mess has certainly raised some awareness about the routine injustices endured by people of color in America, and a lot of corporations have pledged to do better on the diversity front, but it’s still a mess.\\n\\nOur political culture is also a mess, and Ginsburg’s death is making it even messier. Republicans who refused to consider Obama’s nominee for the Court because eight months before an election was too late have made it clear that two months before an election is not too late to rubber-stamp Trump’s nominee, because they have the power to do it. Democrats are warning that if they take power they might pack the Court, abolish the filibuster, add new states and otherwise rewrite the rules of Washington. It’s an all-out political war where both sides consider the other an existential threat to the nation. The rhetoric sounds a lot like actual war, with Trump talking openly about using the courts to shut down the counting of votes and using force to shut down any protests that might ensue.\\n\\nNot great! #2020worstyear is a meme for a reason. For the same reason, Trump’s only consistent campaign message is that Biden would make things even worse. He sometimes argues for making America great again, again, but even after telling more than 20,000 falsehoods, he rarely tries to pretend that things are currently great. Instead, he’s retweeting deceptively edited and fake videos of Biden looking clueless and dancing to gangsta rap, while falsely claiming that Biden is a pedophile who wants to defund the police, destroy the suburbs, eliminate borders, confiscate your guns and quadruple your taxes.\\n\\nIt’s troubling that the president’s former national security adviser called him dangerously unfit, and perhaps even more troubling that the Justice Department is now investigating that adviser. Of course, John Bolton isn’t the only Trump aide turned Trump critic and Trump nasty-tweet-target; former Defense Secretary James Mattis and former fixer Michael Cohen wrote books, too, while former chief of staff John Kelly, who reportedly watched Trump call soldiers suckers, has backed Bolton’s claim that Trump pressured Ukraine to announce an investigation of Biden. Most recently, former homeland security adviser Miles Taylor accused Trump of offering preemptive pardons to border officials if they committed crimes, withholding disaster aid to blue states, and reshaping his Homeland Security Department into an arm of his reelection campaign. Trump has publicly trashed all of them, as if they were interlopers who infiltrated his administration.\\n\\nThis, to repeat the most overworked phrase of the Trump era, is not normal.\\n\\nThe normalization of banana republic-style abnormality was the main reason that last end-of-year essay was so gloomy. The economy was fine, but it seemed ominous that the president was attacking his own FBI, Justice Department and intelligence agencies for failing to trash his enemies; dismissing the investigation of Russian election meddling as a “WITCH HUNT” and cooperating witnesses as rats; calling prominent African Americans stupid and scapegoating immigrants as potential terrorists; and gaslighting the country so brazenly that The Washington Post’s fact-checkers invented the “Bottomless Pinocchio” to categorize his most egregious lies. It also seemed ominous that congressional Republicans had no problem with any of this, or with revelations that his for-profit university and charitable foundation were frauds, or with his administration’s routine defiance of congressional subpoenas. Meanwhile, Trump’s relatively normal advisers, the “adults in the room” like Mattis and Kelly, were leaving en masse.\\n\\nTrump’s willingness to violate norms was a big part of his attraction in 2016. He seemed like an antidote to “politics as usual.” He told the establishment to go to hell. His base loved it, because he picked fights with the kind of people they hated. But some of the norms he constantly violates are the ones that helped make America great in the first place—not only norms of honesty and civility and decency, but norms of service.\\n\\nPresidents have always at least pretended to try to serve all Americans, but Trump is quite openly the president of Red America, attacking Democratic cities and states as anarchic hellholes controlled by treasonous enemies of the people, withholding aid after disasters and threatening to send in troops during protests, most recently dismissing blue state coronavirus deaths as if they had happened in another country. No president has ever been so blatant about rescuing his political allies from legal trouble, or so open in his belief that his government should be tormenting his enemies. He has pardoned supporters like the right-wing propagandist Dinesh D’Souza, the right-wing insurrectionist Ammon Bundy and the racist sheriff Joe Arpaio, while intervening to keep his former national security adviser Michael Flynn and political guru Roger Stone out of jail. And even after he was impeached for trying to gin up an investigation of Biden in Ukraine, he called for another one of Biden in China, his allies launched one of the Biden family in Congress, and his Justice Department launched one of the Obama administration’s national security team. When foreign leaders behaved that way in the past, the U.S. State Department used to issue stern rebukes.\\n\\nWhich brings us back to that 2020 electoral landscape. Trump is trailing badly in the polls, but he has not been doing the basic things one might expect of a beleaguered incumbent eager for reelection. He has not forced Republicans to give him more stimulus to help revive the moribund economy, even though voters tend to punish presidents for recessions that happen on their watch. He has not been moving heaven and earth to contain the virus—by ramping up testing or tracing, or begging Americans to wear masks, or at least not contradicting his public health bureaucracy in public—even though it’s obviously in his political interest to have the pandemic subside. And he has not made much effort to reach out to voters beyond his substantial but less-than-a-majority base of white MAGA voters; he’s still trying to kill Obamacare in court, he’s still complaining publicly about John McCain, and he didn’t even attend Rep. John Lewis’ funeral.\\n\\nOne possible explanation for this behavior, suggested recently by the New Yorker’s Susan Glasser, Vox’s Ezra Klein, and the Atlantic’s Derek Thompson is that the American public has become so irredeemably divided along partisan lines that there’s not much point trying to persuade voters of anything. Impeachment and the pandemic have not changed Trump’s bad-but-not-horrible approval ratings, and as Thompson pointed out, the implosion of the economy has not even changed the public’s views of the economy. In a shirts-and-skins nation where Trump can always count on a friendly echo chamber on Fox News and conservative radio and QAnon Facebook groups, it might be more politically effective to deny unpleasant realities that his base rarely hears about than to do the work to try to improve them.\\n\\nThe notion that the country is so polarized that nothing matters anymore is not a happy one, but it’s less creepy than the possibility that Trump isn’t trying to appeal to a broader range of voters because he has an alternative strategy for remaining in the White House. Beyond his message that Biden is a feeble dementia patient who can barely speak, and his secondary message that Biden is a fearsome leftist who’s going to rip America to shreds, Trump’s main themes about the election is that it’s sure to be rigged, that it’s impossible for him to lose if it isn’t rigged, that mail-in ballots will be riddled with fraud, and that his supporters should vote twice … just to stress-test the integrity of the electoral process. At the same time, a high-ranking Homeland Security official has alleged that Trump’s aides ordered him to stop seeking intelligence about Russian meddling in the election and start producing reports to back up a narrative about Chinese meddling. The Trump donor who runs the U.S. Postal Service has chosen the leadup to this unprecedented election during a pandemic to implement “reforms” that include removing mailboxes and sorting machines that could make voting by mail easier. Some of Trump’s media allies, including the irrepressible Stone, are basically urging Trump to declare martial law, and the president has been talking an awful lot about violence and strength.\\n\\nIt’s not an awesome situation. Even before Ginsburg’s death raised the possibility that a right-wing Court could block progressive legislation for a generation and roll back the regulatory state, Democrats were framing Trump’s reelection as the death of American democracy, while Republicans were portraying Democrats as forces sinister enough to justify any norm-breaking in the service of keeping them out of power. The longtime Republican strategist Stuart Stevens, whose new book, It Was All a Lie trashes the GOP as a kind of Mafia organization, believes this is the most dangerous moment for American democracy since the Civil War; he fears that Trump will send federal agents to seize ballot boxes in Democratic cities, and he doesn’t think anyone will stop him.\\n\\nIt’s certainly true that the Republican strategy for 2020 seems to rely less than one might expect on attracting new voters and more than one might hope on suppressing Democratic votes, helping Kanye West drain away Democratic votes, and messing with the mechanics of the ballot. My beloved Heat offered their downtown Miami arena as a roomy urban voting location; my Republican mayor, who’s running for Congress as a Trump ally, said no. The University of Georgia, which is opening its football stadium for football, refused to open its stadium for voting.\\n\\nWhether or not the worst fears about the integrity of the election materialize, it seems quite likely that the post-election period will get ugly. No matter who wins, a lot of Americans won’t accept the results, and a lot of American cities might have Kenosha-type moments. This was a bitterly divided country even in 2014, when the first Awesome column ran, but it’s starting to feel more like two pissed-off countries living in two entirely different realities. It’s going to be really tough to govern. Meanwhile, China is on the rise, our allies feel abandoned and America’s total failure to control Covid has erased our global aura of competence and expertise. No matter who wins, it’s going to be equally tough to restore American leadership in the world.\\n\\nTrump rose to power by warning about nonexistent “American carnage,” but now we have real American carnage. One enduring lesson of history, not particularly comforting right now, is that things can always get worse. But one enduring lesson of American history, the lesson of the Louisiana Purchase and the Emancipation Proclamation and Bretton Woods and women’s suffrage and the polio vaccine and the civil rights movement and the iPhone, is that things can get better, too. America has the power to self-correct, to form a more awesome union.\\n\\nOf course, there’s never really been a time in this country when everything was awesome; that was always a glib way of saying that for the decade after the anguish of the Great Recession, most things were getting better for most Americans, and that better is better than worse. But that era of improvement is over now, and so is the Everything Is Awesome franchise. Someday, hopefully, America will be made awesome again, again.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-playbook/2020/09/11/trumps-silence-on-western-wildfires-did-covid-19-reach-la-first-hoover-fellow-potus-adviser-scott-atlas-under-fire-haim-sabans-500k-fundraiser-for-biden-sf-to-reopen-hair-nail-salons-gym-490300', 'Full Text': 'TRUMP’s silence on Western wildfires — Did Covid-19 reach LA first? — Hoover fellow, POTUS adviser SCOTT ATLAS under fire — SF to reopen hair, nail salons, gym Presented by The Great Courses Plus\\n\\nTHE BUZZ — CALLING 911: California and the West is on fire.

And as the Sac Bee’s Michael McGough and Tony Bizjak reported, the lightning-sparked August Complex fire now ranks as the largest fire in the state’s recorded history.\\n\\nFirefighters monitor the Bear Fire burning in Oroville, Calif., on Wednesday, Sept. 9, 2020. | AP Photo/Noah Berger\\n\\nAND THERE’S THIS: With much of Northern California under the pall of an ungodly orange glow, “rarely have so many Californians been exposed to such gloomy, unhealthy air,” the LA Times’ Susanne Rust and Tony Barboza reported.\\n\\nTrump has tweeted about everything from Kim Jong Un’s health to an endorsement Thursday for former CAGOP operative Jim Bognet, the ex-deputy campaign manager for Steve Poizner who’s now running for Congress in Pennsylvania. But the last time Trump tweeted about California’s health was August 6.\\n\\nThe deafening silence from the Oval Office hasn’t gone unnoticed.\\n\\n“The West is on fire. Trump hasn’t bothered mentioning it,’’ read the headline of a piece by Gwynned Stuart in LA Magazine. Stuart noted that, “at the moment, President Donald Trump is attempting to manage the revelation that he intentionally downplayed the Covid-19 pandemic, which has now killed upward of 191,000 Americans. That effort has apparently left little room on his mental plate for the dozens of fires currently ravaging California, Oregon, and Washington.’’\\n\\nTrump’s silence stands in stark contrast to other public figures, including his Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden tweeted yesterday that “the images coming out of California, Oregon, Washington, and other Western states are truly horrifying.”\\n\\nTrump’s 2016 Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton tweeted a nightmarish fire photo. “None of this is normal, and confronting climate change is on the ballot this year. Vote, as early as you can, for a habitable planet,” she wrote.\\n\\nFormer President Barack Obama also tweeted photos of California’s orange skies, saying “the fires along the West Coast are just the latest examples of the very real ways our changing climate is changing our communities. Protecting our planet is on the ballot. Vote like your life depends on it—because it does.”\\n\\nDespite Trump’s silence, as AP’s Aamer Madhani, Kathleen Ronayne and Will Weissert note, climate change will shape the presidential election that’s now just two months away.\\n\\n“The Biden campaign understands that a full embrace of an aggressive climate change agenda could create problems for them in the Upper Midwest,” said Dan Schnur, who served as an adviser to former California Gov. Pete Wilson and Arizona GOP Sen. John McCain. “Trump has shown no desire to talk about California beyond using it as a liberal punching bag to make his case to his conservative base.”\\n\\nStay tuned.\\n\\nBUENOS DÍAS, good Friday.

Gavin Newsom, after the president slammed California this weekend for its “extreme agenda”?\\n\\nTrump will hit California Monday, touching down in Air Force One at McClellan Park to meet with federal emergency officials and local leaders about wildfires that have ravaged the state.\\n\\nAnd while Newsom will join state fire and emergency officials in the Monday morning briefing with Trump, Newsom’s staff said Sunday night that meeting will be private, as Carla reported. The governor will then depart separately from the president for his own tour of active fire areas of the state, the governor\\'s team said Sunday.\\n\\nThe private session — and Newsom\\'s departure immediately afterward — follow weeks of silence from Trump about the devastating natural disasters in solidly blue California, as Carla detailed Friday.\\n\\nAnd it comes on the heels of Trump placing blame on California last month for its wildfires, which have since consumed more than 3 million acres in the state and caused at least 22 deaths here. Newsom replied to the president in an address at the Democratic National Convention, rebuking Trump for saying “we hadn\\'t raked enough leaves.\"\\n\\nThe stop in California, which has been choking amid some of the world\\'s worst air quality for days, was added over the weekend to Trump’s already planned campaign swing to Arizona and Nevada, where he appeared Sunday.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump arrives to speak at a rally at Xtreme Manufacturing, Sunday, Sept. 13, 2020, in Henderson, Nev. | AP Photo/Andrew Harnik\\n\\nEVEN AS HE PREPARED TO COME HERE, Trump in Nevada this weekend slammed the state, telling a Minden, Nev. rally that \"California has already implemented this extreme agenda. And they\\'re experiencing massive blackouts.\" On the Western wildfires, he said repeatedly: “Please remember the words — very simple — forest management. Please remember. It’s about forest management.’’\\n\\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, on CNN with Jake Tapper Sunday, called Trump out: “There’s a deep feeling that you get different treatment in this administration, in terms of speed and attention, based on how people have voted.\"\\n\\nNewsom on Friday expressed growing anger with those he said are continuing to downplay the effects of climate change — a description that clearly fits Trump. “California, folks, is America fast forward,’’ he said Friday. “What we’re experiencing right here is coming to communities all across the United States of America unless we get our act together on climate change.”\\n\\nSo Newsom on Monday clearly will not want to hand Trump a juicy photo op in front of Air Force One — something the president would no doubt use to his benefit in the next 50 days.\\n\\nONE THING’S FOR SURE: Look for the governor to avoid a repeat of the scenario when he praised Trump for his Covid-19 response — “promise made, promise kept” — only to find himself starring in Trump reelection campaign ads.\\n\\nWAPO’s Philip Bump: “If California wanted Trump to worry about it, it should have been a swing state.’’\\n\\nBUENOS DÍAS, good Monday morning.

But it wasn’t a game-changer, either.\\n\\nSen. Kamala Harris of California went toe-to-toe with Vice President Mike Pence in a high-stakes debate last night — taking the Trump administration to task for its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, taxes and jobs.\\n\\nBut the historic VP debate — between a black, South Asian woman and a white man — may be remembered more for the dodging and sidestepping of questions from both candidates.\\n\\nHarris scored points early for effectively going after Trump and Pence on their Covid pandemic response — and may have come away with the toughest lines and hits on that topic, calling it “the greatest failure of a presidential administration in the history of our country.’’\\n\\nPence struggled to defend the administration’s Covid response — and completely sidestepped questions on America’s high infection rate and why the White House didn’t observe mandates on masks and social distancing at a recent event in the Rose Garden. His response: “President Trump and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interests of their health.” But he rebounded with hard parries, trying to pin Harris down on court-packing while arguing that she held radical positions on the “Green New Deal,” fracking and trade issues.\\n\\nVice President Mike Pence listens as Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris speaks during the vice presidential debate Wednesday, Oct. 7, 2020. | Justin Sullivan/Pool via AP\\n\\nTHE BOTTOM LINE: “Covid and Court take center stage at a more normal vice presidential debate,’’ by POLITICO’s David Siders: “Interested viewers could hear what the two candidates were saying. Disinterested viewers could flip the channel to baseball without worrying a bomb was about to go off.” More debate highlights via POLITICO.\\n\\nCNN POST DEBATE POLL: Who won? 59 percent said Harris, 38 percent Pence.\\n\\nCALIFORNIA-CENTRIC HIGHLIGHTS:\\n\\n— Pence, asked about California wildfires and climate change, shouted-out Gov. Gavin Newsom: \"The climate is changing. The issue is, what is the cause, and what do we do about it? … With regard to wildfires, we believe forest management has to be front and center. Even Governor Newsom agrees that we need to have better forest management.”\\n\\n— Harris’ comeback on wildfires: “Joe understands that the West Coast of our country is burning, including my home state of California. And so Joe believes, again, in science. Donald Trump, when asked about the wildfires in California, … you know what Donald Trump said? ‘Science doesn’t know.’”\\n\\n— Pence criticized Harris for being too tough a prosecutor: “When you were D.A. in San Francisco, when you left office, African Americans were 19 times more likely to be prosecuted for minor drug offenses than whites and Hispanics. When you were attorney general of California, you increased the disproportionate incarceration of Blacks in California. You did nothing on criminal justice reform in California. You didn\\'t lift a finger to pass the First Step Act on Capitol Hill. The reality is, your record speaks for itself.”\\n\\n— A clearly annoyed Harris came back at him: “Having served as the attorney general of the state of California, the work I did is a model of what our nation needs to do, and will be able to do under a Joe Biden presidency. Our agenda includes what this administration has failed to do. … This is the work that we\\'ve done, and the work we will do going forward. And I will not be lectured by the vice president on our record.”\\n\\nLINE MOST LIKELY TO END UP ON A T-SHIRT, h/t NYT\\'s Jennifer Medina: “He interrupted me and I’d like to finish,’’ and “Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking’’ — both tweeted all night by women who have experienced a “man-splaining” moment, including Assemblymembers Lorena Gonzalez and Buffy Wicks. A similar exchange, via BuzzFeed’s David Mack.\\n\\nMEME OF THE NIGHT: The fly that landed on Pence’s head. The Biden campaign was ready with a visual joke, a fundraising pitch and Biden/Harris-branded fly swatters.\\n\\nVIDEO OF THE NIGHT: A supercut of Harris’ facial reactions.\\n\\nFROM THE TWITTERSPHERE:\\n\\n— State Sen. @Scott_Wiener: “‘Donald Trump has Jewish grandchildren’ = ‘I have Black friends so I can’t be racist’”\\n\\n— Trump campaign operative @RichardGrenell: “It’s clear that @KamalaHarris panicked whenever VP Pence talked about her record on Green New Deal, fracking, Criminal Justice Reform and how so many black people went to jail for minor offenses in California when she was AG.”\\n\\n— Former California first lady @MariaShriver: “Thanks to both of these candidates for tonight. Thank goodness it was civil. Hope it doesn’t become all about the fly or the eye #VPDebate #VPDebate2020”\\n\\n— San Francisco Supervisor @MattHaneySF: “Kaiser Hospital in Oakland just got a shout out in the Vice Presidential Debate!

White: The person had not “come into contact with Newsom or with staffers who regularly interact with the governor. The California Department of Public Health is aiding Newsom\\'s office in tracing the infected individual\\'s contacts.”\\n\\nHILL NO — “Anonymous ‘former staff’ of Katie Hill slam film adaptation of ex-congresswoman’s book,” by POLITICO’s Quint Forgey: “The posters went on to write in a 10-part Twitter thread that Hill’s story ‘is also one of workplace abuse and harassment.’ Hill ‘can be both a victim and perpetrator,’ they wrote, arguing that she ‘is not a hero for women.’”\\n\\nCRUSHED HOPES FOR 2020 — “Hard Lives Made Harder by COVID: Homeless Endure a ‘Slow-Moving Train Wreck,’” by California Healthline’s Anna Maria Barry-Jester and Angela Hart: “If the state’s goal was to ward off a deadly COVID-19 outbreak among the homeless, it can claim success. … But suffering comes in other forms. And interviews with dozens of homeless people, activists and local officials in 12 counties reveal a new magnitude of hardship and indignity for California’s homeless — and no easy answers ahead.”\\n\\nGO A’s — “Oakland A’s keep season alive with thrilling comeback victory,” by the Mercury News’ Shayna Rubin.\\n\\nAND ELSEWHERE IN BASEBALL — The Dodgers beat the Padres 6-5 Wednesday night, as the LA Times’ Jorge Castillo reports.\\n\\nCORONAVIRUS UPDATES\\n\\nNO OPENING AT ‘HAPPIEST PLACE’ — “California Gov. Gavin Newsom Says Disneyland & Other Parks Not Opening Soon As He Reveals Disagreement With Disney Chief Bob Iger,” by Deadline’s Tom Tapp. Newsom: “We don’t anticipate in the immediate term any of these larger parks opening until we see more stability in terms of the data. … We feel there’s no hurry to put out guidelines, and we continue to work with the industry.’’\\n\\nOFF-CAMPUS OUTBREAKS — “Serious COVID-19 outbreaks hit California colleges despite intense preparation,” by the LA Times’ Colleen Shalby: “Unchecked by campus rules and safeguards, these students became fertile ground for the virus, which has spread rapidly on and around several California campuses despite sparsely populated dormitories and classrooms.”\\n\\n— “Four Bay Area counties fall short of state’s new coronavirus equity metrics, which are needed to advance reopening,” by the SF Chronicle’s Tatiana Sanchez.\\n\\nTHE FIFTY: Governors and mayors have never mattered more to the future of the nation, and The Fifty, a new series from POLITICO, takes you inside the role they’re playing in the pandemic and more.\\n\\nTHE TRUMP ERA\\n\\n— “The White House is a coronavirus hot spot. But no one can make it do contact tracing,\" by the LA Times\\' Emily Baumgaertner: \"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends contact tracing for all coronavirus outbreaks, has teams of experts who could carry it out for the White House. The Trump administration, however, has relegated contact tracing to an internal team of doctors, who reportedly have focused on tracking down those in close proximity to the president between the Sept. 29 debate in Ohio and his positive test for the coronavirus two days later.\"\\n\\n— “Trump officials blast California \\'sanctuary\\' laws in detailing arrests,” by POLITICO’s Jeremy B. White: “Trump has regularly decried ‘sanctuary’ policies, singling out California as an example of Democratic lawlessness. His administration has unsuccessfully gone to court to try and dissolve California’s restrictions. Wednesday’s press conference helped bolster that message weeks before the presidential election, although Wolf insisted politics did not play a role.”\\n\\n— “ICE arrests 128 immigrants in California ‘sanctuary cities,’” by the OC Register’s Roxana Kopetman.\\n\\nNO FREE LUNCH — “California school districts spurn \\'back-patting\\' Trump food box letter,’’ by POLITICO’s Mackenzie Mays: “The superintendent of the nation’s second largest school district on Wednesday accused President Donald Trump of possibly violating the Hatch Act by inserting a letter in food boxes for distribution at schools and pantries just weeks before Election Day.”\\n\\nCOUNT CONTINUES — “Appeals court stops Trump administration from shutting down census before Oct. 31 deadline,” by the SF Chronicle’s Bob Egelko.\\n\\n— “Climate Change, Forest Management and Wildfires,” by state Sen. John Moorlach for Fox and Hounds: “For years, Newsom — and Gov. Jerry Brown before him — talked about managing our forests and preventing wildfires, but it’s been more lip service than actual deeds.”\\n\\nPRESIDENTIAL PURSUIT\\n\\n— “Second Trump-Biden debate will be virtual, commission announces,\" by POLITICO\\'s Quint Forgey.\\n\\n— “Carly Fiorina explains planned Biden vote, claims Trump has \\'damaged\\' GOP,” by Fox News’ Talia Kaplan.\\n\\nCAMPAIGN MODE\\n\\n49ERS’ YORK SINKS ANOTHER $300K: As we reported earlier this week, the 49ers’ owner, Jed York, has already dumped $1.1 million into an independent expenditure committee to elect a slate of city council members in Santa Clara, where his team plays at the $1.2 billion Levi’s stadium. Campaign finance documents show he added another $300,000 to the pot last night.\\n\\n— “America scrambles to take part in the Mark Zuckerberg $250 million gold rush,” by Vox’s Theodore Schleifer: “Zuckerberg’s $250 million gift to bolster local governments has set off a gold rush across the country as frenzied election officials rush to apply, secure, and deploy the money.”\\n\\nPROP 22 — “Lawmakers want to amend this prop? It’ll take a ‘super, super, super-duper majority,’” by CalMatters’ Ben Christopher: “By default, a law enacted by ballot measure can only be changed by another law enacted by ballot measure. … Compared to that default, Prop. 22’s high bar for amendments actually gives the Legislature more influence than the norm.”\\n\\nUNWANTED SUPPORT — “Darrell Issa’s uncomfortable endorsement by the American Independent Party,” by the San Diego Union-Tribune’s Michael Smolens: “Some political strategists believe the AIP endorsement can help electorally in some areas, at least on the margins, or they wouldn’t pursue it for their candidates, who are frequently Republicans. In Issa’s case, no request was made for the endorsement, according to his campaign manager, John Franklin.”\\n\\nATKINS CHALLENGE — “San Diego’s 39th state Senate district pits powerful incumbent against former write-in candidate,” by the San Diego Union-Tribune’s Jeff McDonald: “But Linda Dealy Blankenship, a Carmel Valley homemaker who worked her way into the November runoff as a write-in candidate in the March primary, is undaunted by the challenge of trying to topple popular San Diego Democrat Sen. Toni Atkins.”\\n\\nLOOKING AHEAD TO 2022: Businessman John Cox submitted a contribution report Wednesday for a 2022 gubernatorial exploratory committee, to which he’s given $50,000. It’s the latest sign he’s angling for a rematch against Newsom.\\n\\n— “GOP Senate group\\'s fundraising letter may have violated state law,” by the LA Times’ David Lazarus.\\n\\nGAVINLAND\\n\\nNEWSOM DEFENDS MASK TWEET — via POLITICO’s Carla Marinucci: “Newsom pushed back hard Wednesday against Republicans and conservative media slamming his recent tweet calling for masks in between restaurant bites, flipping it back on President Donald Trump by saying critics should ‘soberly take a look at what\\'s going on in the White House\\' and consider the severe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Americans and the economy.\\n\\n— “Some Republicans have been having a field day with Newsom’s Oct 3 suggestion on Twitter: ‘Going out to eat with members of your household this weekend? Don\\'t forget to keep your mask on in between bites.’\\n\\n— “The Daily Mail headlined [Tuesday] that Newsom is being ‘ridiculed’ for the tweet, and quoted from a number of critics who suggested the tweet was legislative overkill.\\n\\n— “‘People want to bastardize these things and manipulate these health guidelines,’ said Newsom, asked about the criticism. But the Covid pandemic ‘requires seriousness of purpose and serious leadership — and it requires people to move out of their bunker mindset.’”\\n\\n\\n\\nA message from The Great Courses Plus:\\n\\nCALIFORNIA AND THE CAPITOL CORRIDOR\\n\\n— “Can California ban fracking? Newsom\\'s bold plan to fight climate change faces skepticism,” by the LA Times’ Taryn Luna and Phil Willon: “The call to ban fracking left some questioning whether the intent of the well-timed move by a governor with a taste for big promises was to draw national headlines or to launch a political dogfight in Sacramento against oil interests and their trade union allies.”\\n\\nEDD UPDATE — “Here’s how California’s new ID.me verification system for unemployment is working,” by the SF Chronicle’s Kathleen Pender: “About 64% of the people who applied for unemployment benefits in California since the Employment Development Department deployed a new online identification tool Thursday were able to verify their identities using a mobile phone or computer, the vast majority without human assistance, according to data released Wednesday.”\\n\\nNO HOME FOR HOMEKEY — “Milpitas mayor threatens to sue California over homeless housing project,\" by the Mercury News\\' Marisa Kendall: Milpitas Mayor Rich Tran \"argues the project, which is exempt from the city’s usual permitting process, was rushed through without input from Milpitas officials or community members.\"\\n\\n— “Newsom’s pick for California high court talks about coming out: ‘My journey was different’,” by the LA Times’ Maura Dolan: “He began coming out as gay during the last four to five years, he said during an interview Tuesday, and found the experience invigorating. He fell in love with his partner, real estate broker Sydney Shand, two years ago.”\\n\\nFIRESTORM — “As Glass Fire burns, Wine Country residents grapple with future: ‘I just can’t deal with this anymore,’” by the SF Chronicle’s Mallory Moench and J.K. Dineen.\\n\\nANCIENT WISDOM — “Alarmed by Scope of Wildfires, Officials Turn to Native Americans for Help,” by the NYT’s Jill Cowan: “The work requires a deep understanding of how winds would spread flames down a particular hillside or when lighting a fire in a forest would foster the growth of certain plants, and that knowledge has been passed down through ceremony and practice. But until recently, it has been mostly dismissed as unscientific.”\\n\\nCOX’S PLAN — “California group: Fight wildfires with new ‘air armada’ paid for by scrapping bullet-train project,’’ via Washington Times.\\n\\nANOTHER NOBEL FOR UC BERKELEY — “2 scientists win Nobel chemistry prize for gene-editing tool,” by the AP’s Marilynn Marchione, Christina Larson and David Keyton.\\n\\nPOLITICO’S CALIFORNIA BALLOT TRACKER: No state does ballot initiatives quite like California, and interest groups are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to sway voters. It’s all here in POLITICO’s guide to California’s 2020 ballot initiatives.\\n\\nSILICON VALLEYLAND\\n\\n— “House Lawmakers Condemn Big Tech’s ‘Monopoly Power’ and Urge Their Breakups,” by NYT’s Cecilia Kang and David McCabe: “In a 449-page report that was presented by the House Judiciary Committee’s Democratic leadership, lawmakers said the four companies had turned from ‘scrappy’ start-ups into “the kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons.’”\\n\\n— “Facebook to ban political ads from election night until further notice,” by POLITICO’s Nancy Scola.\\n\\nHOLLYWOODLAND\\n\\n— “Anita Hill-Led Hollywood Commission Reveals Gender, Racial Bias Gap in Industry Workplaces,” by the Hollywood Reporter’s Etan Vlessing: “Women surveyed were around twice as likely as their male colleagues to say they had experienced biased or unfair behavior, according to the report. And women of color cited even higher rates of diversity and inclusion bias, or unfair behavior, than their White counterparts.”\\n\\n— “U.S. Theaters Stare Down Worst-Case Scenario for 2020,” by the Hollywood Reporter’s Pamela McClintock.\\n\\nCANNABIS COUNTRY\\n\\nWHEN LIFE GIVES YOU LEMONS — “Four candidates vying for mayor’s job in Lemon Grove,” by the San Diego Union-Tribune’s Karen Pearlman: “Looking for a way to close the financial gap, Lemon Grove will be looking to voters on Nov. 3 to pass a tax on any cannabis stores in the city.”\\n\\nMIXTAPE\\n\\n— “Five sailors granted immunity to testify in San Diego Navy SEAL sexual assault trial,” by the San Diego Union-Tribune’s Andrew Dyer.\\n\\n— “Bay Area home prices soar with suburban boom,” by the Mercury News’ Louis Hansen.\\n\\n— “Pastor of iconic Sacramento church molested stepdaughter for years, suit claims,” by the Sac Bee’s Sam Stanton.\\n\\n— “Man suspected of killing 2 daughters, self in California,” via the AP.\\n\\nIN VALLEJO — “California city OKs emergency declaration to reform police,” by the AP’s Janie Har.\\n\\nIN MEMORIAM\\n\\n— Newsom issued a statement Wednesday regarding the death of California Community Colleges board of governors member Alma Salazar, saying that “through her service on the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, Alma opened doors and changed lives.”\\n\\nA message from The Great Courses Plus: Are you an inquisitively curious individual that loves learning?

Gavin Newsom and state and federal officials in a two-hour stopover.\\n\\nTrump, taking questions from local reporters, defended himself against critics who said he waited weeks to mention California fires, insisting he “immediately” responded to calls from Newsom. (He called our question about his delay on California response “nasty” — more on that later.) And the president also repeatedly insisted that the state’s troubles are rooted not in climate change but in forest management.\\n\\nFIVE TRUMP VISIT TAKEAWAYS:\\n\\n— TRUMP’S KEY MESSAGE: “I love California. I love all of our first responders and FEMA. We’ve been working very well with Gavin. We\\'ve been working very well with the state. We approved emergency declarations. And hopefully, it\\'ll be under control fairly soon.”\\n\\n— ‘RAKE THE LEAVES’ REDUX? “When trees fall down, after a short period of time — about 18 months — they become very dry. They become, really, like a matchstick. And ... there’s no more water pouring through, and they become very, very — well, they just explode. They can explode.\\n\\n“Also, leaves — when you have years of leaves, dried leaves, on the ground, it just sets it up. It’s really a fuel for a fire. So they have to do something about it. So we talk about forest management. And I’ve been talking about it for a long time — that they have to do that.”\\n\\n— NEWSOM MEETING THE MOMENT: If some progressives wanted a Gavin vs. Donald smackdown, they didn’t get it. Newsom made his case — respectfully. “We can agree to disagree on the politics,” Newsom told Trump, “but one thing is fundamental: 57 percent of the land in this state is federal and 3 percent is state forests.” Read the full transcript of the meeting.\\n\\nHe later told reporters, according to pool report audio via the Chico Enterprise-Record: “I wanted the president to know that we have established an engagement we would like to build on — to state in a way that wasn’t trying to take a cheap shot, wasn’t trying to score political points, but to make the argument, we believe in climate change out here. We don’t believe it just because science says it; we observe it, we experience it, and that was an opportunity to remind him of a point he’s very familiar with, but to do so in an honest and forthright way.”\\n\\n— CROWFOOT TOE-TO-TOE WITH TRUMP: The real drama came when California Secretary of Natural Resources Wade Crowfoot challenged Trump. His blunt argument to the president turned into the must-see moment of the day.\\n\\nCrowfoot: “If we ignore that science and sort of put our head in the sand and think it\\'s all about vegetation management, we’re not going to succeed together protecting Californians.”\\n\\nTrump: “It’ll start getting cooler. You just watch.”\\n\\nCrowfoot: “I wish science agreed with you.”\\n\\nTrump: “Well, I don’t think science knows, actually.”\\n\\n— WAS THERE A PHOTO OP? Nope, no “shake hands and act like friends” moments between the governor and president that could end up in a campaign ad. POTUS seemed resigned to the optics of the day: \"As far as I\\'m concerned, I\\'d be OK with it. But maybe the state would rather not have that, and that\\'s OK with me, too.\"\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump listens as California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks during a briefing at Sacramento McClellan Airport, in McClellan Park, Calif., Monday, Sept. 14, 2020. | AP Photo/Andrew Harnik\\n\\nTHE COMING STORM — “Climate clash hits 2020 race as California burns,’’ by POLITICO’s Kelsey Tamborrino, Caitlyn Oprysko and Carla: Trump and Biden “offered a striking split screen on the role of climate change in raging wildfires on the West Coast, with each staking out dramatically different positions on what has caused the blazes that have consumed vast amounts of acreage in California in recent weeks.\\n\\n“In dueling events, Biden linked the blazes — as well as deadly heat waves and a recent string of hurricanes and disastrous flooding elsewhere — to climate change, while Trump dismissed the established science that shows global temperatures will continue to climb because of rising greenhouse gases from the use of fossil fuels.\\n\\nAND THERE’S THIS, via POLITICO’s Colby Bermel: “Trump visit punctuates growing divide over main cause of historic wildfires in Western states” — “California seems helpless to break a cycle of catastrophic wildfires as it suffers another year of massive destruction, and the fault lines over climate change and forest management are growing as the fall campaign season gets underway.”\\n\\nFACT-CHECK: “Trump downplays climate change, says California must thin forests. What he got wrong,” by the Sac Bee’s Dale Kasler.\\n\\nBUENOS DÍAS, good Tuesday morning. Kamala Harris hits Fresno Tuesday for her first California event in months. A major focus: climate change and the wildfire devastation, via YourCentralValley.com\\n\\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: “I got a call from the governor immediately [when the fires began], I called him ... and on that call I declared it an emergency. … So don’t tell me about not doing it, because that was immediate. That included FEMA coming here … and everything else, so that’s a nasty question.” A visibly irritated Trump pushes back on our “nasty” question about the three weeks it took him to comment, or tweet, about California’s wildfires.

It\\'s also the story of a junior employee wielding extraordinary moderation powers that affected millions of people without any real institutional support, and the personal torment that followed.”\\n\\nWILL FEINSTEIN FALTER? — “Progressives fret Feinstein won’t be tough enough in handling Biden judicial nominees,” by the LA Times’ Jennifer Haberkorn: “Fueling progressives’ concern is [Sen. Dianne] Feinstein’s refusal to say whether she would give Republicans power to block appellate appointees through a Senate practice known as withholding blue slips.”\\n\\nSTUNNING ALLEGATIONS — “‘Like an Experimental Concentration Camp’: Whistleblower Complaint Alleges Mass Hysterectomies at ICE Detention Center,” by Law&Crime’s Jerry Lambe.\\n\\nPOLICE PLAY POLITICS — “How politics and police unions stopped bills to hold bad cops accountable,” by the LA Times’ George Skelton: “A major police reform bill was quietly killed by the Assembly speaker without a house vote on the last night of the legislative session.

Both offer a chance to alter previous landmark voter-passed initiatives: Prop 16 would unravel Prop 209, the 1996 ban on race-based admissions and hiring for public institutions, while Prop 15 would relax the tax-limiting framework of Prop 13, the 1978 tax revolt measure that’s since become sacrosanct to big business and homeowners. But Prop 16 is in rough shape, and Prop 15 is in for a fight.\\n\\nAFFIRMATIVE ACTION: A resurgent racial justice movement propelled affirmative action out of the Legislature and onto the ballot — but voters are going to be harder to convince than legislators. A new Public Policy Institute of California poll finds that Prop 16 is deeply underwater, with just 31 percent of likely voters saying they’d back it and 47 percent opposing it. There’s still a potential margin of victory in the 22 percent who said they had no opinion.\\n\\nThe cash advantage clearly rests with proponents: The ‘Yes on 16’ side has collected nearly $11 million, including from heavy hitters like Kaiser, the California Teachers Association and both legislative leaders, while the ‘No on 16’ side has generated about $180,000 – barely enough to buy some mailers, much less statewide TV time. But despite that monetary advantage, the numbers point to an uphill climb for proponents.\\n\\n\"I Voted\" stickers distributed on Super Tuesday in El Segundo, Calif., March 3, 2020. | AP Photo/Ringo H.W. Chiu\\n\\nSPLIT ROLL: Progressives have long yearned to amend Prop 13 to generate more revenue, and a labor-backed coalition hoped high liberal turnout would make 2020 the year. PPIC found a slim one-point majority is now in favor of Prop 15, with 51 percent of likely voters saying they’d back it and 40 percent against it; that’s a decline from the 53 percent of voters who backed it in PPIC’s April tally, although the 11-point margin represents an increase of 5 points. And voters are invested in the outcome of this fight, with a vast majority calling the outcome important and nearly half dubbing it “very important.”\\n\\nCampaigns still have six weeks to shape public opinion, and you can count on a dueling barrage of Prop 15 ads from well-funded supporters (who will say schools and cities need the money more than ever during a recession) and opponents (who will say an economic recovery is the worst time to burden businesses). Both are prepared to spend what it takes, although we may not see many first-term House Democrats backing the measure: Across eight competitive House districts, voters oppose Prop 15 by a two-to-one-margin, although PPIC includes the still-conservative CA-4 (12-point GOP edge) and CA-50 (10-point GOP edge) but not the recently flipped CA-49.\\n\\nDATA POINTS: Gov. Gavin Newsom is sitting pretty with 60 percent approval from likely voters and 62 percent approval for his coronavirus handling. Those numbers put him in a commanding position as he navigates the politically treacherous balance between controlling the virus and reviving the state’s ailing economy, and Californian voters trust him far more than President Donald Trump, whose Covid-19 course they disapprove of by 35 points. But Californians are wary of what comes next: Voters are evenly split on whether we’re headed in the right or wrong direction.\\n\\nAnd while Joe Biden is trouncing Trump statewide by 30 points, the president has a three-point edge (50 to 47) in those competitive CDs, where Republicans also drew a net lead of 12 points over Democrats (see caveats about districts above). And as Trump baselessly accuses California of voter fraud, Republican voters are wary of the vote’s integrity, with a third saying they have “very little” confidence.\\n\\nBUENOS DÍAS, good Thursday morning.

White: “College football is big business and has become a major flashpoint in a national struggle over coronavirus restrictions. While Newsom did not actively call for games to commence, he also did not come out against athletes returning to the field. … Football players at the University of Southern California, a perennial juggernaut, had written Newsom lamenting excessive ‘restrictions imposed by state and local health officials in California that prevent us from resuming practices and competitions.’”\\n\\n— “Sheriff’s combative response to shocking deputy attack sparks new alarms, criticism,” by the LA Times’ Alene Tchekmedyian: “Within 24 hours, a longtime Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman posted tweets about the attack that employed racist stereotypes in reference to a reward for information leading to the arrest of the shooter.”\\n\\nBOAT FIRE — “A ‘pop,’ a ‘crackle,’ then ‘fire!’: NTSB records show dramatic moments as flames swept Conception dive boat,” by the LA Times’ Kim Christensen and Richard Winton.\\n\\nCALIFORNIA ON FIRE\\n\\n— “Streak of 30 straight Spare the Air days in Bay Area will end Thursday,” by the Mercury News’ Rick Hurd.\\n\\n— “‘No end in sight’: California firefighters battle exhaustion, heat and pandemic in historic wildfire season,” by the SF Chronicle’s Mallory Moench: “As of Tuesday, Silvera had worked 37 days straight in the CZU Lightning Complex fires in Santa Cruz County.

Law enforcement leaders never fully embraced her, and some progressives also viewed her warily.”\\n\\nHARRIS\\' HERITAGE — “Trump spent years trying to win over Indian Americans. Then Biden picked Harris.” by POLITICO’s Anita Kumar: “Within days, Harris was speaking to Indian Americans on India’s Independence Day about her grandfather, who helped push for India’s liberation. Then she was boosting the campaign’s launch of a new Indian coalition. And last week, Biden supporters released a video with a song remix from the popular Bollywood movie ‘Lagaan’ about an Indian village fighting British rule.”\\n\\n— “\\'Won\\'t Stand for It\\': Women of Color Prepare for Biased Attacks on Kamala Harris,” by KQED’s Scott Shafer.\\n\\nA message from The Great Courses Plus:\\n\\nCAMPAIGN MODE\\n\\nCCPOA CONTROVERSY — “CCPOA removes video with crosshairs over Assemblymember\\'s face,” by POLITICO’s Jeremy B.

Phi Murphy needed to finally get the millionaires tax done was a pandemic.\\n\\nDavid Wildstein reports that Murphy, Senate President Steve Sweeney and Speaker Craig Coughlin are closing in on a deal coupling the millionaires tax with a one-time $500 tax break for some less-wealthy New Jerseyans, while putting the financial transaction tax off the table (at least as part of the budget talks).\\n\\nThis isn’t a surprise considering legislative leaders have been telegraphing their willingness since Murphy’s budget address, but it’s still shocking considering how dug in Sweeney had been against the tax since Murphy’s inauguration — the tax he passed numerous times under former Gov. Chris Christie, knowing it would get vetoed.\\n\\nThat was before Murphy’s popularity soared as the pandemic slammed New Jersey and hasn\\'t so far abated too much despite the tragedies at the nursing homes and the unemployment waits and the MVC lines. But I think the bigger factor here is not Murphy’s popularity, or the suffering of New Jersey’s less wealthy residents during the pandemic. The idea of continually resisting efforts to make the state’s wealthiest pay more when so many are hurting is politically untenable. And so the tax cut coupled with it makes political sense.\\n\\nAnd don’t expect that baby bonds proposal to be in the budget.\\n\\nWHERE’S MURPHY? — Somwhere in the 2nd District at 1 p.m. to join Amy Kennedy to announce her campaign plank for South Jersey infrastructure, then Cape May for a 2 p.m. ribbon cutting ceremony at the Harriet Tubman Museum.\\n\\nCORONAVIRUS TRACKER — 447 newly diagnosed cases for a total of 197,792.

Phil Murphy said Wednesday his chief counsel Matt Platkin will leave the administration in mid-October. Platkin will join the law firm Lowenstein Sandler in its white collar criminal defense and business litigation groups. Platkin has been in his role as chief counsel since Murphy took office in January 2018. Prior to that, he served as Murphy’s policy director during the gubernatorial campaign. \"For the past five years, Matt has been by my side counseling me on every single consequential decision I\\'ve made,\" Murphy said in a statement. \"From raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour to enacting the nation\\'s strongest equal pay legislation, Matt has served our Administration with integrity, talent, and a deep sense of purpose. I look forward to continuing to rely on his counsel as he begins the next chapter of his professional life.\"\\n\\nLTCS — Murphy signs bills to raise long-term care wages and force reinvestment in resident care, by POLITICO’s Sam Sutton: Five months after New Jersey‘s nursing homes and long-term care facilities were the epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic, Gov. Phil Murphy on Wednesday signed four bills designed to help stem future outbreaks, stabilize the industry’s workforce and centralize the state’s unwieldy bureaucracy for oversight. “These are big steps forward to make sure we live [and] we learn — that we can address what was an uneven performance of that industry,” Murphy said during a Covid-19 press briefing earlier Wednesday afternoon, adding that there’s hope the legislation puts “some pieces in place that will have some permanent significance to allow us to weather future storms.” More than 7,000 residents and staff of New Jersey‘s long-term care facilities have died after testing positive for Covid-19, representing a little less than half the total deaths believed to have been caused by the virus since the state recorded its first case in early March.\\n\\n— “Hundreds rally outside NJ veterans home to demand investigation of coronavirus deaths”\\n\\nMAND MEN — Murphy won’t support eliminating mandatory minimum sentences for official misconduct, by POLITICO’s Matt Friedman: Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday that he does not support eliminating mandatory minimum sentences for official misconduct. POLITICO reported Wednesday morning that a bill to eliminate or reduce mandatory minimum sentences for mostly nonviolent drug and property crimes was quietly amended to also eliminate mandatory minimum sentences for official misconduct. An accompanying bill was also amended to make those changes retroactive for current inmates. As initially written, the bills, NJ A4369 (20R) and NJ A4370 (20R), were based on the recommendations of a November 2019 report by the New Jersey Criminal Sentencing and Disposition Commission. However, the report by the state-appointed commission did not recommend doing away with mandatory minimum sentences for official misconduct. “Let me say unequivocally, official misconduct was not on the list,” Murphy said in response to a question during his regular press briefing in Trenton. “So I just want to say as clearly as I can: I do not support official misconduct being roped into this legislation.”\\n\\nTHE INVINCIBLES — Positive Covid-19 tests rising among young people in New Jersey, by POLITICO’s Sam Sutton: Young people are fueling the Covid-19 pandemic in New Jersey. The spot positivity rate for residents between the ages of 14 and 24 is more than triple that of the state at-large, Gov. Phil Murphy and Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli told reporters Wednesday. Residents in that demographic were testing positive roughly 3 percent of the time in mid-August, Persichilil said. That number is now eclipsing 7 percent, she said, citing the most recent data collected by the health department. Overall, the state’s spot positivity rate on tests taken Sept. 12 was just 2.06 percent. “With schools and colleges reopening, this is just a reminder to take this virus seriously,” Persichilli said during Murphy’s regular press briefing in Trenton.\\n\\n— Opinion: “Illicit raid of Clean Communities Fund will gut litter clean-up programs”\\n\\n— “Activists fight budget cuts to inmate transitional programs”\\n\\n— “N.J. sales tax revenue rebounds for 1st time since pandemic hit.

Cory Booker (D-N.J.) introduced legislation Wednesday that would appropriate $100 billion to advance the cleanup of legacy pollution and ensure safe drinking water across the country. The Environmental Justice Legacy Pollution Act — exclusively obtained by POLITICO — would also bar the approval of permits for major sources of air pollution, such as refineries or power plants, in communities already affected by it. “In order for communities of color, low-income communities, and indigenous communities to thrive, this legacy of pollution must be eliminated,” Booker, the former mayor of Newark, said in a statement.\\n\\nTRUMP LAWSUIT— Trump campaign seeks to halt early vote counting while lawsuit against New Jersey is decided, by POLITICO’s Matt Friedman: President Donald Trump’s campaign wants a federal judge to act soon to prevent New Jersey from counting mail-in ballots starting 10 days before the Nov. 3 election. In a court filing Wednesday, the campaign also asked U.S. District Court Judge Michael Shipp to bar elections officials from accepting mail-in ballots that do not have a postmark for two days after Election Day. The campaign and its co-plaintiffs, the Republican National Committee and the New Jersey Republican State Committee, filed an “an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue” — its first move to hasten the lawsuit they filed Aug. 18. But the motion, signed by state Sen.

The ruling could mean deportations of about 70,000 New Yorkers and New Jerseyans, including Nancie Adolphe, who arrived from Haiti more than two decades ago, at age 11. Adolphe has TPS, as do her parents. But her three siblings are U.S. citizens and would be left in Brooklyn if she and her parents lose TPS and get deported.”\\n\\n— “Seven weeks before election day and U.S. Senate recount remains in court”\\n\\n— “Presidential Politics has Huge Implications in CD2’s Van Drew v.

Council will vote Thursday on moving the capital city’s nonpartisan election from May to November. If passed, the measure, sponsored by controversial legislator Robin Vaughn, shifts the runoff for mayor and council races to December from June.

Cherry Hill Towne Center cited the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting government restrictions in mothballing its project ‘at least for the foreseeable future,’ U.S. District Judge Renee Marie Bumb said in a ruling Thursday. The judge approved the developer\\'s request to drop its lawsuit against GS Park Racing, the track\\'s former operator.

After months of keeping it shut down to stem the spread of the coronavirus — the only jurisdiction in the state, and one of a few in the country, to enforce such a ban — Gov. Andrew Cuomo gave city eateries the go-ahead to open their dining rooms on Sept. 30.\\n\\nThere will be rules, and lots of them. Restaurants are limited to 25 percent of their usual capacity, with tables placed at least six feet apart. Diners must have their temperatures checked at the door. Bar service is a no-go. Someone in every party must share contact information with the business in case there’s an outbreak and contact tracers need to track them down. And closing time is midnight.\\n\\nStill, the announcement is a major step towards some semblance of normalcy for the one-time epicenter of the pandemic, and a boon for the devastated restaurant industry, which has been growing increasingly desperate as colder weather approaches. Indoor dining has been off the table since March, when bars and restaurants were forced to close as the pandemic bore down. Outdoor dining began in June , but plans to allow indoor service as part of the city’s phased reopening were called off as infections surged around the country, though restaurants in other parts of the state were allowed to operate indoors at half capacity. In recent weeks, frustrated restaurant owners hit the city and state with lawsuits and a growing number of politicians came out in favor of allowing it.\\n\\nAt the same time, public health officials and nervous New Yorkers will be watching carefully to see what happens to the city’s Covid-19 numbers when restaurants reopen — just over a week after schools welcome students back — looking to see whether the one-two punch headed into fall leads to new outbreaks. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who was unsurprisingly not a part of Cuomo’s announcement, is mostly on board, saying earlier in the day that the city and state were working on a deal to allow restaurants to open. But he says that if the positive test rate hits 2 percent, the city will quickly reassess the decision.\\n\\nIT’S THURSDAY. Got tips, suggestions or thoughts? Let us know ...

One teacher was at P.S. 001 Bergen School in Sunset Park and the other teacher at M.S. 88 in Park Slope, City Councilmember Brad Lander said in a phone interview Wednesday. In a statement, a DOE spokesperson confirmed the two cases and said they notified staff at both schools immediately after the results were reported. ‘School staff have access to free, expedited testing and we’ve encouraged all staff to get tested before they return to buildings while we continue to navigate the realities of a pandemic,’ said Miranda Barbot of the DOE in an emailed statement... The city's Test and Trace Corps is also investigating the contacts the two teachers may have had. Under the DOE's protocol, one case does not close down a school, though staff had the option to work from home while contact tracing is complete.” Gothamist’s Sophia Chang\\n\\n— “School buses will be rolling when New York City’s district schools reopen to students on Sept. 21, Mayor Bill de Blasio promised on Wednesday. His pledge came just days after education department officials told parents it was unclear whether transportation will be in place on time. About 100,000 school bus seats are expected to be available, covering students with disabilities who are legally entitled to bus service as well as thousands of other students who live farther away from their schools.” Chalkbeat’s Alex Zimmerman\\n\\n— “A long-awaited return to school for some teachers was anything but a welcome sight. Educators at a building for children with severe disabilities walked into dirty conditions, missing protective gear, and incomplete ventilation checks, teachers and union officials said Tuesday.”\\n\\n— Catholic schools across the five boroughs opened on Wednesday for in-person classes.\\n\\nMAYOR BILL DE BLASIO drew widespread condemnation Wednesday for his decision to transfer hundreds of homeless men out of an Upper West Side hotel — a move opposed by his own social services commissioner, according to multiple sources. De Blasio said Wednesday he personally made the call to move nearly 300 men out of the Lucerne on 79th street, a luxury hotel in the affluent Manhattan neighborhood, following well-funded opposition ... De Blasio denied Wednesday he was caving to political pressure, insisting it was “the beginning of a larger effort to come back from those hotels” — a shift from just a month ago, when he suggested people experiencing homelessness could remain in hotels until there’s a Covid-19 vaccine. City Hall sources told POLITICO that Department of Social Services Commissioner Steven Banks was not supportive of the decision — and shelter providers, homeless advocates and politicians said it only emboldens homeless shelter opponents around the five boroughs. POLITICO’s Janaki Chadha\\n\\n— De Blasio said conditions around the Lucerne were “not acceptable” as authorities Wednesday morning discovered a resident had died inside.\\n\\n— The number of people living in homeless shelters has fallen to its lowest level in six years, likely driven by a moratorium on evictions.\\n\\n“CHRISTOPHER MCCORMACK is one of the New York Police Department’s highest-ranking officers. As an assistant chief, he helps oversee drug enforcement and organized crime investigations throughout the city. He was hand-picked for the promotion two years ago by his old friend James O’Neill, who was police commissioner. But his ascension started three decades earlier, when he was a rookie cop patrolling drug-infested Washington Heights. … He would earn the nickname 'Red Rage' for his ginger hair, fiery temperament and aggressive approach to policing. Street cop. Sergeant. Lieutenant. By 2006, McCormack was running his own narcotics squad. Captain. Deputy Inspector. By 2011, he had his own precinct, more than 200 officers in his command. ...\\n\\n“Along the way, police leaders were privy to an ever-growing list of complaints against McCormack, signs that his harsh tactics and heated temperament were pushing the limits. Some of the grievances were made in lawsuits that the city eventually settled. Others were submitted to the Civilian Complaint Review Board, created to investigate misconduct. Many of the allegations were hidden from public view. Using court records, newly released data and a trove of confidential documents, ProPublica has pieced together just how much top officials had to look past to promote him. The allegations against McCormack read in some ways like those against many other cops in the NYPD: that he was destructive in searching a home or overly physical with someone on the street. What stands out, though, is how often Black and Latino men accused him of invasive, humiliating searches. They say he pulled down their pants in public, exposing their genitals; some said he used his fingers to search for drugs around and inside their anal cavities or directed his officers to do so.” ProPublica’s Joaquin Sapien, Topher Sanders and Nate Schweber\\n\\n“TIFFANY Cabán, a former public defender who ran as an insurgent candidate and came within 60 votes of clinching the nomination for Queens District Attorney last year, is launching her campaign for the City Council on Thursday.

The seat is currently held by Council member Costa Constantinides, who will be term-limited out of office at the end of next year. The former public defender is expected to make the announcement in her home neighborhood of Astoria -- at the same location where she conceded the race against Melinda Katz last summer.” NY1’s Gloria Pazmino\\n\\n“LAST WEEK, NYPD Deputy Chief Thomas Burns retired from the department after a 36-year career. According to a video tweeted by NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea, Chief Burns received a significant sendoff , including a large indoor gathering inside police headquarters that seemingly violated state health guidance prohibiting events with more than 50 people. Many in the crowd can be seen without masks on. Chief Burns's job was the commanding officer of the NYPD's Family Assistance Division, which helps the loved ones of officers who are ill or have died in the line of duty. More than 40 members of the NYPD have died from the coronavirus since the pandemic began, thousands more have called out sick with the illness... Seth Prins, an epidemiologist and professor at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health, said the countless photos and videos of NYPD officers without masks on were ‘disturbing.’ ‘It's this kind of behavior that could lead to a second wave, or a second surge, of the virus,’ Prins told Gothamist.” Gothamist’s Christopher Robbins\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHAT ALBANY'S READING\\n\\n“ROBERT FREEMAN, former director of the state Committee on Open Government, will pay a $15,000 fine to settle claims he broke state law by systematically sexually harassing women while on the job, including several reporters who sought his advice on public transparency disputes.

They said the order violated the Due Process Clause and the Takings Clause of the U.S. Constitution. But U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel disagreed — and upheld an earlier court ruling. Further, the judge noted the landlords missed an August deadline for objecting to Cuomo’s request to dismiss the case. ‘The plaintiffs have not come forward despite an opportunity to do so with any argument or reason why the court ought not to grant the motions,’ Castel wrote.

Senior officials at U.S. Customs and Border Protection just didn't know any better, said Audrey Strauss, the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Customs officials wrongly said in earlier court papers that New York, thanks to its Green Light Law allowing undocumented immigrants to get driver's licenses, was the only state that barred the agency from accessing driver's license records. In reality, several other states do the same thing — but ‘CBP was simply not aware of that,’ Strauss wrote in a letter filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan over the weekend.

Fighting to afford to stay, fighting for our kids, fighting a system that wasn\\'t built for us, doesn\\'t speak our languages, doesn\\'t hear our voices,\" Wu says in the video .\\n\\n\"I\\'m running for mayor to make Boston a city for everyone,\" Wu continues. She recorded the video in English, Spanish , and Mandarin . Wu lists priorities including affordable housing, public education, increased access to transportation, public health funding and a \"city Green New Deal.\"\\n\\nWu\\'s entrance into the 2021 mayoral race tees up the next big Democratic contest in Boston. She was the top vote-getter in the city’s last municipal election in 2019. It\\'s likely that Wu will face incumbent Mayor Marty Walsh, though he has not announced whether he\\'ll run for a third term. Pressed for an answer on his future plans last week, Walsh told GBH\\'s \"Boston Public Radio\" he has more to do in Boston.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t have a plan to give up on a city where I have a lot more to do,\" Walsh said, but cautioned that he won\\'t reveal his plans for some time. It\\'s also unclear whether more candidates may jump into the race, and some political watchers speculate Walsh could score an administration role if Democratic nominee Joe Biden is elected in November.\\n\\n\"The mayor\\'s race is a year away,\" Walsh said on Friday. \"I\\'m not gonna start playing politics in September of 2020 when I have much more important things to focus on.\"\\n\\nSome accused Walsh of playing politics earlier this month when he confirmed to the Boston Globe that Wu had called him and shared her plans to run for mayor. Walsh pushes back on that assessment, saying the Globe had other sources and that it would have been unfair of him to withhold information from the press.\\n\\nWu will hold a series of campaign launch events throughout the week. She\\'ll begin by greeting MBTA riders at Nubian Station this evening and then visit supporters in Allston-Brighton. Wu begins the race with $346,000 in the bank, according to her latest campaign finance report. If he decides to run, Walsh has $5.5 million in his war chest.\\n\\nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK: BALLOT QUESTIONS READY FOR PRIME TIME — There are two questions facing Massachusetts voters in November: Whether the state should update a 2013 auto repair law, and whether it should implement ranked-choice voting in future elections. Groups linked to both questions are hitting the airwaves this week.\\n\\nThe Yes on 2 Campaign, which supports ranked-choice voting, is spending half a million dollars on its first ad blitz. The ranked-choice voting proposal would allow voters to rank all candidates on the ballot, rather than choose just one.\\n\\nThe group will spend $495,700 in the Boston media market over the next seven days, along with $54,500 on streaming services. The campaign will also spend $95,000 on digital ads. A recently-formed group that opposes ranked-choice voting has not bought space on the airwaves.\\n\\nAnd the group opposing Question 1, the auto repair question, is out with a new ad this morning. The ballot question puts repair shops and automakers at odds, and has already drawn $35 million in contributions on either side of the issue. The question asks voters whether the state should update an existing law that would make it easier for independent auto repair shops to access vehicle data, though opponents of the question argue it would put consumer data at risk.\\n\\nThe new 30-second spot from the Coalition for Safe and Secure Data features Ron Santos, owner of Santos Auto Body in Millis. He pushes back on the pro-Question 1 argument that updating the law would benefit independent repair shops.\\n\\n\"Question 1 is really about big repair chains getting access to your data, that can be sold to advertisers,\" he says in the ad. Top funders opposing Question 1 include General Motors, Ford and Toyota. Top-spending supporters of the ballot initiative include O\\'Reilly Auto Parts, Advance Auto Parts and AutoZone.\\n\\nHave a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

POLITICO\\'s Gabby Orr breaks down the key moments from Tuesday night\\'s showdown between Trump and Biden — and what it all means for the final stretch of the campaign.\\n\\nIn the fall of 2016, he shrewdly used the policy issues of immigration, trade and Obamacare, and the personal issues of alleged corruption, against Hillary Clinton. That formula yielded an Electoral College victory by taking three Midwestern states — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan — that had long voted for Democrats in presidential elections.\\n\\nThose debate performances were always studded with Trumpian misinformation, gratuitous personal attacks and the strategic deployment of disrupting the proceedings. But Trump always had a core message and a well-honed argument about his opponents.\\n\\nTuesday was different for three reasons.\\n\\nFirst, Trump, the king of powerfully simplistic political branding, no longer seems to have a message. In 2016 he had his four pillars of immigration, trade, Obamacare and corruption. He had slogans that were effective: “Make America Great Again,” “Build the Wall.” Quick, what’s Trump’s message in 2020? Nothing really leaps out. There is no Trump legislative agenda on Capitol Hill. He was asked recently by The New York Times what he wanted to do in a second term and the paper noted he talked about cutting regulations and taxes, appointing conservatives judges and border control. But the paper also somewhat mischievously recorded this meandering non-response from the president that became a popular meme:\\n\\n“But so I think, I think it would be, I think it would be very, very, I think we’d have a very, very solid, we would continue what we’re doing, we’d solidify what we’ve done, and we have other things on our plate that we want to get done.”\\n\\nThe Trump campaign put out a second-term agenda, a hodgepodge of big ambitions (“Create 10 Million New Jobs in 10 Months,” \"Eradicate Covid-19\") and conservative buzzwords (“Teach American Exceptionalism”), but the president has been erratic in discussing the agenda or its key plank.\\n\\nIn 2016, Trump had a clear and concise line of attack against Hillary Clinton: She was a corrupt member of the Washington establishment and he was going to send her to jail if he became president. He discussed the alleged perfidy of her deleting personal emails with impressive discipline. But Biden has proven to be a more elusive target. Sometimes he is \"Sleepy Joe.\" Other times he\\'s a dangerous radical. At this point in the campaign in 2016, Clinton had become a despised figure among Trump’s hardcore supporters. Those supporters in 2020 can’t seem to muster the same amount of antipathy for the former vice president.\\n\\nFinally, and most important, Trump in 2020 is burdened with a record, one that has sunk him into chronic unpopularity for several years now, even during the height of his economic boom. Trump was not the first American politician to successfully win an election by casting himself as a populist outsider taking on the corrupt establishment. That playbook is as old as the republic.\\n\\nBut those outsiders who suddenly arrive in Washington or a state capital with no experience and ill-equipped for the job suddenly realize the limits of the campaign schtick. (This happened to former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, the former professional wrestler who declined to run for a second term in 2002.)\\n\\nWhen they could be heard through the fog of Trump’s insults and interruptions, the portions of the debate that were most devastating to Trump were Biden’s prosecution of the case against the president’s handling of the pandemic, the economy and health care, particularly the effects of gutting Obamacare.\\n\\nBiden was by no means commanding on Tuesday. In the hands of a more nimble and energetic Democrat, these portions of the debate might have been more devastating for Trump. (Naturally people on the left thought so: “Bernie would have annihilated Trump,” wrote the New York progressive activist Jonathan Tasini.)\\n\\nWhat it all adds up to — no message, no killer line of attack against Biden, no defense of his record — is that Trump resorted to strapping on an explosive vest. Perhaps the idea was to sully both Biden and the moderator, Chris Wallace, who was incapable of controlling the president’s interruptions. “Mr. President, please stop,” Wallace said at one point, seeming to speak for many viewers.\\n\\nIf Wallace and Biden were discredited, then nobody had standing to fact check Trump or probe his record. Meanwhile, the stream of interruptions, personal insults and attacks on Biden’s family made it nearly impossible for Biden, who is already a mild-mannered debater, to make a clear case for himself or against Trump.\\n\\nWhatever the thinking behind what the strategy would accomplish, it was born of desperation from a candidate who is mired in a health crisis he can’t control, down in the polls and struggling to articulate a case for why he deserves a second term.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/28/florida-senior-voters-presidential-election-422767', 'Full Text': 'Ryan Tyson, a Florida Republican pollster and founder of the Tyson Group, said Biden is running up against a ceiling of 38 percent with white voters that other Democrats almost always hit in Florida.\\n\\n“Biden might be doing a point or two better than Hillary Clinton did in 2016,” Tyson said of the race for Florida’s senior vote. “But he is hitting the same ceiling with white voters that Hillary Clinton and [2016 Democratic gubernatorial candidate] Andrew Gillum did. If Democrats figure that out, they win the state. But they have not.”\\n\\nTo break out, Biden has put more than $700,000 into a Florida ad highlighting Trump’s “planned cuts to Social Security.” The ad references an August executive order from Trump that would temporarily suspend the collection of payroll taxes, which fund Social Security. It’s Biden’s seventh senior-focused ad.\\n\\nIn a Tampa Bay Times op-ed, Biden wrote about “Donna and Roger” from The Villages, a retirement community north of Orlando, and how Trump’s mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic left them unable to see their grandchildren.\\n\\n“Jill and I feel the same way about not seeing our grandchildren as much as we want to,” Biden wrote. “Video calls are great, but they’re just not the same, especially after six months of being away from the ones you love the most at the time in your life you need them the most.”\\n\\nTrump last week rolled out a package of health care-focused promises, including mailing $200 drug discount cards to retirees before Election Day to defray the cost of prescription drug co-pays, a push to end the practice of surprise medical billing, and a pledge to protect insurance coverage for people with preexisting conditions.\\n\\nAnd, like Biden, Trump also is tapping into fear. One campaign ad contemplates a lawless future if Biden becomes president. The 30-second spot concludes with “You won’t be safe in Biden’s America”. Trump’s campaign has so far put $1.1 million behind the ad in Florida, of which more than $400,000 was spent in the Orlando media market, home to The Villages.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/13/trump-biden-mormons-church-412234', 'Full Text': '“I don\\'t understand how a member of the LDS Church could support somebody that is amoral and has shown his amorality from the time he came into our view,” former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada and member of the church, said in an interview.\\n\\nTrump’s campaign is hoping that more Mormons have gone the way of Lee and right-wing radio host Glenn Beck — erstwhile critics who’ve come to support Trump.\\n\\nIn 2016, Democrats did not appear to convert many of the Mormons who voted against Trump. Some stayed home, while many others cast a protest vote for the conservative LDS third-party candidate, Evan McMullin, who earned 21 percent of Utah’s vote. McMullin also received about 7 percent in neighboring Idaho, but his support in Arizona was negligible because he was not listed on the ballot and was only a write-in candidate.\\n\\nWithout McMullin in the race, and with turnout expected to exceed that of 2016, both parties see a rare group of potentially persuadable voters at a very unpersuadable time.\\n\\n“Not having the third party ticket with Evan McMullin will help give us an opportunity to pull some of those voters into the Trump camp,” McDaniel, who is Romney’s niece, said.\\n\\nMcMullin, who still opposes Trump, said he thinks some of his supporters will vote for the president but that “most people who voted third party in 2016 will be supporting Biden in this election.” He argued that some Republicans voted for Trump “out of habit” but have since soured on him.\\n\\nA Biden official conceded that Trump will likely improve on his 2016 performance among Mormons, but that the Democrat\\'s goal is to significantly limit those gains. Some longtime LDS Democratic organizers said Biden has already improved on Hillary Clinton’s efforts, which they said were too focused on Utah.\\n\\n“The Biden campaign seems much more aware of the Latter-day Saint diaspora in the Mountain West and the Atlantic South,” said Rob Taber, a national co-chair of LDS Dems.\\n\\n\"It’s not going to be shocking that Trump wins the Mormon vote, but if it’s 10 to 15 points off of the norm in Nevada and Arizona, that’s a big deal,\" said Quin Monson, a partner at the Utah-based polling firm Y2 Analytics and a political science professor at the Church-funded Brigham Young University. \"It’s the equivalent of Republicans suddenly getting a quarter of the African American vote, and I do think it’s within the realm of possibility. They\\'ve not come around completely on Donald Trump.\"\\n\\nSo far, the Trump campaign appears to be dedicating more of their candidates’ time to courting Mormon voters. While Pence visited Arizona, there are no plans for Biden or his running mate Kamala Harris to participate in a Mormon-oriented event. Biden’s advisers believe his Roman Catholicism could also appeal to LDS voters, but the campaign isn’t airing ads in Arizona focusing on his religion.\\n\\nTrump is trailing Biden by about 5 points in Arizona, according to polling averages, and LDS voters could be decisive if the race tightens. In 2018, Kyrsten Sinema won massive Maricopa County — which includes the historically Mormon suburb of Mesa — becoming the first Democrat to win an Arizona Senate seat since the 1980s.\\n\\nTrump\\'s campaign advisers have said they don\\'t see Maricopa County as a must-win; instead, they’re looking to run up the president’s margins in rural Arizona. The LDS enclaves in the White Mountains will be key to that effort.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/trump-policy-moves-final-weeks-415630', 'Full Text': 'The president is also still vaguely promising ill-defined developments on core voting issues like health care, taxes and immigration, after signing a flurry of executive orders in recent weeks on issues like drug pricing and temporary work visas.\\n\\nThe tactic is now familiar for Trump: Throw out a bunch of policy offerings — real or not — in the run-up to an election in the hopes something will stick. In 2018, he promised a tax cut proposal that never materialized and turned a “caravan” of migrants into a scare tactic that he dropped shortly after the election. Now, it\\'s a series of executive orders, signing ceremonies and Twitter proclamations that are often oversold or appear micro-targeted to specific voting blocs.\\n\\n“There’s a concerted effort to make good on promises from the 2016 campaign trail, as well as promises that have been made during President Trump’s first term in office,” said Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller. “Many of these things we have coming up have taken years to put together or move along, so this just happens to be when things are brought to completion.”\\n\\nCritics say the rapidity of announcements and the campaign’s eagerness to spin them into ads demonstrates the underlying political motivation.\\n\\nAfter Tuesday’s signing ceremony at the White House, Halie Soifer, the executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America said “any opening between Israel and its neighbors is a positive thing,” but added, “there’s no denying this ceremony was driven by domestic politics for Donald Trump.”\\n\\nBut Ralph Reed, a top surrogate for the Trump campaign and the executive director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a major social conservative group, hailed the event as historic.\\n\\n“The fact that it plays well with some constituencies in no way diminishes the historic nature of the achievement or its potential to advance peace in the region,” said Reed.\\n\\nThere’s nothing new about incumbent presidents fast-tracking policies or announcing diplomatic breakthroughs in the lead-up to an election. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed bipartisan welfare reform into law, taking the policy issue off the table for Republicans. And in 1964, President Lyndon Johnson, hoping to push back on criticism about his foreign policy credentials, signed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which enabled Johnson’s use of military force in Vietnam, and the Wilderness Act to help bolster his standing with conservationists.\\n\\n“Within a matter of weeks in 1964, you saw Johnson addressing two weak spots, conservationists and the Roosevelt Republican world and foreign policy,” said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley. “It’s an advantage that a sitting president has that they can create a dramatic backdrop for whatever they do.”\\n\\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

The move gained kudos from Republicans in the tourism and real estate industries concerned about the potential impact offshore drilling could have on their businesses.\\n\\nYet Trump was essentially reversing his own initiatives with the move: He vowed in 2018 to allow oil and gas drilling in nearly all United States coastal waters, and just last month finalized plans to open up part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas development. Trump has also rolled back Obama-era regulations on fossil fuels and exited the Paris agreement on climate control measures, two moves that environmental advocates say will damage the climate and increase pollution.\\n\\nGina McCarthy, head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama and now CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the move was a “transparent attempt to manipulate Floridians two months before Election Day.”\\n\\nBiden campaign spokesperson Andrew Bates said, \"What families aren’t hearing from Donald Trump at these events is deafening: a coherent strategy to lift the country out of the worst public health crisis in 100 years and change the game for middle-class families.”\\n\\nOfficials say similar announcements are expected in the coming weeks, although some might remain promises that never come to fruition.\\n\\nThe president will also continue his rallies at airport hangars, where Air Force One is always on display, interspersed with official events at the White House that regularly include political attacks on Biden.\\n\\nThose events may focus on trying to show action on the Trump campaign promises that remain unfilled. Obamacare remains intact, Trump’s congressional proposal to overhaul immigration laws has not moved and numerous “Infrastructure Weeks” never produced a substantial bill. Several long-touted policy rollouts, like Trump’s Obamacare replacement proposal, have similarly blown through months of self-proclaimed deadlines.\\n\\n“Every September and October before the election you’re trying to do two things,” said Brinkley. “Develop dirt on their opponent and showcase your presidency.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/13/oracle-bytedance-tiktok-acquisition-413869', 'Full Text': 'The win for Oracle came after its top rival, Microsoft, announced on Sunday that its effort had fallen short. Microsoft\\'s bid, which included retail giant Walmart, would have purchased TikTok\\'s U.S. operations as a way of resolving the administration\\'s concerns about the popular video sharing app\\'s possible ties to the Chinese government.\\n\\n\"ByteDance let us know today they would not be selling TikTok’s US operations to Microsoft,\" the company said Sunday evening.\\n\\nAmerican interest in TikTok increased when the Trump administration signaled in early August that it was considering banning the app amid worries that U.S. data is being funneled to the Chinese government. Trump signed an executive order on Aug. 6 that would prohibit TikTok from conducting transactions in the U.S. effective Sept. 20.\\n\\nBeijing has since put in place regulations requiring the government to sign off on the sale of valuable technology, including algorithms like those that power TikTok. That means any transaction would need to win the approval of officials in China and the U.S., a challenging proposition as Chinese leaders have criticized Trump\\'s effort to force a sale of the company.\\n\\nTrump\\'s executive order declared TikTok a national security threat due to its alleged ties to the Chinese government and barred the company from transactions in the U.S. starting Sept. 20. A follow-up executive order gave TikTok\\'s Chinese parent company ByteDance 90 days to sell its U.S. business — a deal that would require Trump\\'s approval.\\n\\nIn late August, China’s Ministry of Commerce added artificial intelligence technologies to an export controls list, casting doubt about whether the government must green light the sale of TikTok to a foreign company. ByteDance said it would \"strictly comply\" with the new Chinese rules.\\n\\nThe president\\'s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, told POLITICO on Aug. 27 that the administration had no preference for a TikTok buyer, so long as data from U.S. users doesn\\'t flow to Beijing. Trump himself also appeared flexible so long as the Treasury Department is \"well compensated\" in the deal.\\n\\n\"I guess Microsoft wants it and so does Oracle, and probably so do other people, but they have to also make sure the United States is well compensated because we’re the ones making it possible,\" the president told reporters at an event in Yuma, Ariz., in mid-August.\\n\\nTrump did lend a boost to Oracle\\'s bid at the time, calling it a \"great company\" that \"would be certainly somebody that could handle it.\" Oracle\\'s Chair Larry Ellison hosted a high-dollar fundraiser for Trump in February and Oracle executives have been close advisers to his administration even when other tech giants shied away.\\n\\nMicrosoft has cultivated its own positive relationship with the Trump administration, despite high-profile disagreements over issues like immigration and the environment. CEO Satya Nadella spoke with Trump directly in the days before he issued the TikTok executive order, helping to convince the president a sale would be better than an outright ban.\\n\\nOther companies reportedly interested in the app included Google\\'s parent Alphabet, Twitter and the Japanese multinational SoftBank, although preliminary negotiations with those firms fell flat.\\n\\nTikTok has become a social media phenomenon that has only grown in popularity during coronavirus self isolation. The company recently said it counts 100 million monthly active users in the U.S. who generate a trove of lucrative personal data on the internet habits of, mostly young, consumers.\\n\\nBen White contributed to this report.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/22/donald-trump-union-support-snub-joe-biden-418329', 'Full Text': \"Though it showed a virtual tie, the NABTU survey represented a seven-point drop for Trump from March, the first change for the president in two years, said Sean McGarvey, the union president. He attributed the change to Trump’s management of Covid-19, calling it “the greatest mistake of his presidency.”\\n\\n“It’s going to be close among my members between Biden and President Trump, but there’s been dramatic change in the last six months,” McGarvey said, adding that if Trump had been more aggressive toward the coronavirus, “He’d be bulletproof. We wouldn’t even be talking about Joe Biden now.”\\n\\nHowever, even as they praise the Democratic presidential nominee as a less-flawed candidate than Clinton, other union leaders said they fear there’s nothing they can say to the Trump supporters among their ranks to sway their opinion between now and November.\\n\\nThey said parts of Biden’s record, such as his past support for the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, hurt him, and that some members still look to the pre-pandemic economy under Trump as a high point.\\n\\n“It doesn’t seem like there’s anybody changing their minds,” said Don Furko, president of the United Steelworkers Local 1557 in Clairton, Pennsylvania, who said the majority of his membership is backing Trump.\\n\\nIn northern Minnesota, local USW officials are working to educate members on steps Trump has taken to attack organized labor and encouraging them to vote for their jobs rather than on social issues like immigration, said John Arbogast, staff representative for District 11. But, he added, “you’re not going to change a Trumpster’s opinion.”\\n\\nTJ Ducklo, Biden’s national press secretary, said the former vice president “sees this election as Park Avenue vs. Scranton — a choice between someone who has always stood up for working people and believes this country was built by unions, and Donald Trump, who punishes the middle class with tax cuts that only benefit him and his rich friends.”\\n\\nSamantha Zager, deputy national press secretary for the Trump campaign, said, “Throughout his 50 years in politics, Biden has consistently put special interests ahead of American workers — including in his promise to shut the economy back down if he were elected — and that’s why President Trump is seeing strong support from union members.”\\n\\nAt a national level, most union officials have largely lined up behind Biden, appearing with him at events and acting as campaign surrogates. But they said their efforts to spread that enthusiasm have been hindered by the pandemic, which has severely limited organized labor’s in-person ground game.\\n\\nWith the exception of Unite Here, most unions have avoided door-knocking in an effort to prevent spreading the virus. Labor officials said some members don’t share their cell phone numbers, which is a challenge when their efforts to boost Biden have shifted to phone-banking, texting and other virtual work. So-called labor walks — organized labor’s term of art for canvassing — are largely no more.\\n\\nPat Eiding, president of the Philadelphia AFL-CIO, said trades leaders need to talk with their members more often about Biden to be effective. A refinery closed recently in the city and Trump supporters have misleadingly made some union workers believe he'll bring back the facilities, he said.\\n\\nThe evidence that member outreach works, he said, is the 2008 presidential election, when they spoke frequently with the rank-and-file at job sites as early as 5 a.m. and overcame prejudice in their unions against an African-American Democratic nominee.\\n\\n“We said ... the man’s Black. But here's the issues: He’ll protect you and your jobs,’” he said. “And when we were able to go directly to members, instead of just being on a bully pulpit, we were able to get them to vote for Obama.

In his blatant play to win over conservatives who may have been alienated throughout his first term in office, Trump asserted Democrats are at the forefront of an “extreme movement” that, if “granted a majority on the Supreme Court, will fundamentally transform America without a single vote of Congress.”\\n\\nThe “radical justices” appointed by a hypothetical Biden administration, Trump claimed, would “erase the Second Amendment, silence political speech and require taxpayers to fund extreme late-term abortion.” They would also, he asserted, “give unelected bureaucrats the power to destroy millions of jobs” and “remove the words ‘under God’ from the Pledge of Allegiance” — despite Biden’s never having proposed any of those things.\\n\\nThe rest of Trump’s list includes Bridget Bade, a judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron; Paul Clement, a former U.S. solicitor general; Stuart Kyle Duncan, a judge on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; Steven Engel, who heads the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice; Noel Francisco, a former solicitor general; James Ho, a judge on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; Gregory Katsas, a judge on the D.C.

Mike Lee of Utah, on Trump’s most recent list.\\n\\nBut while Cruz and Cotton quickly issued statements thanking Trump for the honor of being named to the not-so-shortlist, Hawley said that he had declined the offer from the president and White House multiple times.\\n\\n\"He first broached this with me, it\\'s been, oh, some weeks ago now,” Hawley told POLITICO. “Well, we were talking about something and the Supreme Court came up … and he said, ‘Oh Josh I\\'d like to put you on the list.’ And I said, ‘Oh no, I\\'m not interested,’ and I had that same conversation with the White House counsel separately, and then separately with the chief of staff. And the president called me again today and he said I\\'d really like to put your name on the list, and I said I\\'m very honored by your confidence but I\\'m not interested.“\\n\\nThe senator said that he had a heads-up that his name would appear on the list anyway, but that he looked forward to continuing to serve in the Senate.\\n\\nTrump announced his intention to release a refreshed list over the summer, after the Supreme Court dealt him a series of legal blows on cases pertaining to issues that have historically fired up his base of conservative evangelicals, like abortion, LGBTQ protections and immigration.\\n\\nBut its release comes as the president enters the final two-month stretch of his reelection campaign very much the underdog — though within striking distance — of former Vice President Joe Biden.\\n\\nThe potential nominees unveiled on Wednesday make up the fourth iteration of Trump’s vaunted list, first released in May 2016 when he was only the presumptive Republican nominee, in an unprecedented effort to shore up conservative support. Trump added another 10 names to the original list of 11 in September of that year, an addition that included Neil Gorsuch, who was Trump’s first appointment to the Supreme Court days after he assumed the presidency.\\n\\nIn November 2017, Trump added another five names to the list, from which the White House said he would select all future Supreme Court nominees.\\n\\nTrump’s efforts to remake the federal judiciary have been a keystone — if a relatively under-the-radar one — of his presidency, and he frequently touts the hundreds of federal judges appointed and confirmed during his tenure, even if he often inflates the total number, as he did again on Wednesday.\\n\\nBut without a vacancy on the high court as there was in 2016, the Supreme Court has been a backburner issue throughout the 2020 campaign, despite several health scares this year alone from Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is 87 and in fragile health, and has become a liberal icon on the court.\\n\\nThe issue picked up new urgency for Trump this summer, however, after a string of high-profile losses in spite of a 5-4 conservative majority on the bench. In one key decision blocking Trump\\'s decision to end the DACA program, Chief Justice John Roberts, an appointee of President George W. Bush, served as the decisive swing vote. In another potentially momentous case, Gorsuch penned the majority opinion as the court found that employment discrimination against gays, lesbians and transgender people is barred by existing law, despite several decades of political and legal consensus that it was not.\\n\\n\"I did a lot of panels at the end of the Supreme Court\\'s term and I was amazed at how angry a lot of conservatives were,\" said Curt Levey of the Committee for Justice, which advocates for conservative judicial nominees. \"I don’t think there\\'s any doubt that conservative disappointment with this last Supreme Court term has affected what conservatives are looking for in a nominee ... There\\'s a lot of movement conservatives out there who need reassuring.\"\\n\\nTrump seemed to both stoke those worries and try to capitalize on them as he vividly attacked the “politically charged” rulings, describing them as “shotgun blasts into the face” of conservatives. He vowed to issue his latest list by Sept. 1, although he wound up missing that self-imposed deadline by about a week.\\n\\nIn another tweet, he sought to clearly lay out the stakes for his voters come November. “Based on decisions being rendered now, this list is more important than ever before (Second Amendment, Right to Life, Religious Liberty, etc.),” he wrote.\\n\\nThe pledge divided Trump’s advisers , who split over the summer about whether the president should tighten the vetting process and winnow his list or expand it further.\\n\\nTrump’s decision to nearly double his existing pool of choices could upset those who favored slashing the original list by as much as half, arguing for a more stringent vetting process, as well as the removal of those with limited records from which to judge the consistency of their judicial philosophy. Those in favor of expanding the list argued that Gorsuch departed from such consistency in his ruling this summer.\\n\\n“The whole purpose of the list is to give hard-line conservatives a guarantee that we will not be betrayed again,” one Republican close to the White House told POLITICO in July.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/18/trump-biden-will-turn-minnesota-into-a-refugee-camp-417900', 'Full Text': '\"These hardened criminals are back in their country where they can do all the complaining they want,\" Trump said. \"And your families are safer for it.\"\\n\\nThe Trump administration has made stonewalling admissions for refugees a cornerstone of its immigration policy.\\n\\nSeeking to draw a contrast with Biden, Trump said the Democratic nominee would open the doors for refugees from \"jihadist regions\" like Yemen and Somalia. He also derided Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who came to the United States as a child refugee from Somalia, calling her an \"extremist.\"\\n\\nTrump last year called for Omar and a number of other high-profile progressive congresswomen to \"go back\" to \"the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\" Supporters also chanted \"send her back\" during a Trump rally last year — a line that has become a rallying cry among his base.\\n\\n\"Omar, how the hell did she win the election,\" Trump said Friday.\\n\\nTrump also directly echoed his law-and-order message in the town a couple of hours to the north of Minneapolis, which was a nexus of protests early this summer after George Floyd was killed by a white police officer. Trump has since derided the protests as violent uprisings, urging federal forces to restore order.\\n\\n\"They\\'re still trying to get rid of your police force in Minneapolis?\" Trump said to a jeering crowd. \"See they never learn.\"\\n\\nTrump has rebranded his rallies as \"peaceful protests\", mocking municipalities that have allowed protesters to gather in spite of social distancing requirements and crowd-size limits due to the coronavirus pandemic. During his Friday talk, attendees were closely packed together, many not wearing masks.\\n\\nConspicuously absent from his address was any mention of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose death was announced during his rally. Trump bragged during the speech that he didn\\'t look at the teleprompter when speaking at rallies, and no aides interrupted him on stage.\\n\\nJust before boarding Air Force One after his rally, Trump said: \"She just died? I didn\\'t know that. She led an amazing life, what else can you say?\"\\n\\nRecent polling has shown Biden pulling ahead in Minnesota, but Trump said Friday that what he\\'s read about the area made him confident he was in good standing.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no way that I\\'m nine points down,\" Trump said. \"This is not the crowd of somebody\\'s who\\'s going to finish second in this state to sleepy Joe.\"\\n\\nTrump’s appearance comes on the heels of Biden\\'s own trip to the battleground state.

By contrast, Judge Morgan Christen, an Obama appointee, suggested there was enough flexibility for the authorities in the order that the appeals court should allow the injunction to go back into effect.\\n\\nThe third jurist on the panel, Clinton-appointed Judge Johnnie Rawlinson, seemed like she could be the swing vote. Her take on the injunction was harder to assess, but she said the case involved the challenge of balancing the rights of journalists “against the right of the police to maintain order.”\\n\\n“How are we supposed to make that balance?” Rawlinson asked.\\n\\nThe injunction and earlier TRO Simon issued bars federal agents from using force against journalists or legal observers and exempts them when orders are given to the general public to disperse. Officers remain free to arrest people who claim to be press or observers, but who engage in criminal activity.\\n\\nJustice Department lawyer Sopan Joshi told the court that the injunction puts federal agents in danger and complicates their work.\\n\\n“This injunction is currently hanging over their heads and every interaction comes with an untenable choice, which is they have to risk their safety or risk contempt,” he said.\\n\\nJoshi also said officers face danger from individuals who claim to be press in order to get behind police lines.\\n\\n“The whole point of a dispersal order is to clear the area of everybody,” Joshi said. “The unrebutted facts show that there are violent opportunists that are hiding behind and pretending to be press.” The DOJ lawyer also asked what officers are to do if “everybody in the crowd pipes up and says, ‘I’m a journalist.’”\\n\\nMatthew Borden, an attorney who brought the case in cooperation with the American Civil Liberties Union, said the concerns about troublemakers masquerading as journalists are exaggerated and that the judge’s orders have proven workable. “There is a perfect track record of safety under this injunction,” he said.\\n\\nBorden said the injunction is crucial to guarantee an independent perspective on the disturbances in Portland and the efforts to quell them. “Allowing the government to control the news is the hallmark of a dictatorship ... They have a public affairs agent who is there taking video and taking photographs,” he said. “Somebody needs to be there to document whether these dispersal orders are legal and whether they’re being enforced in a proper and constitutional way.”\\n\\nJoshi argued that the injunction privileges journalists by guaranteeing them “special access” in a way the Supreme Court has never countenanced.\\n\\nO'Scannlain seemed to agree with that assessment, but Borden insisted that was not the case. He said that while federal agents might be infringing on the rights of many members of the public, including protesters and other passers-by, journalists had the right to go to court and seek protection for themselves even if the injunction Simon granted is “underinclusive.”\\n\\nBorden also said that given the series of allegations that some federal agents directly targeted journalists with less-than-lethal munitions, an order giving media representatives some added protection was appropriate. “Maybe it’s a broader protection than what they might otherwise be entitled to, but it is a reasonable exercise of equitable powers,” he said.\\n\\nChristen said there were “lots and lots of examples” in the court record of journalists claiming they were injured by federal officers. And she emphatically noted that many courts have joined the 9th Circuit in finding a constitutional right to videotape police.\\n\\n“That right has been explicitly recognized by the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 11th Circuits. We’re not alone in that regard,” the judge said.\\n\\nChristen also noted that the injunction permits incidental use of force against journalists if they happen to be intermingled with others legitimately targeted by authorities. And she also questioned whether the federal agents have authority to issue dispersal orders off of federal property.\\n\\nJoshi said that power exists at the federal courthouse and in a park nearby, but the full scope of that authority isn’t relevant to the current case.\\n\\nOne issue that came up near the outset of the 40-minute argument, which the judges and Borden joined by videoconference and Joshi joined by phone, was just where the federal agents are now.\\n\\nThe Trump administration dispatched dozens of Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to Portland in early July after declaring that local officials were being ineffectual in preventing damage to the federal courthouse and other federal buildings. The deployment was opposed by Portland’s mayor and seemed to amplify the protests.\\n\\nSeveral weeks later, the Trump administration and Gov. Kate Brown (D-Ore.) struck a deal to have state police take over protection of the courthouse. Brown and other officials said the federal agents were leaving town, but federal officials were cagey about who — if anyone — was leaving.\\n\\nJoshi maintained that caginess Thursday as O’Scannlain asked what the “status” is of the agents that were sent to Portland.\\n\\n“I don’t think it’s a matter in the record or of public record,” Joshi said.\"}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/18/trump-finds-new-rallying-cry-with-ruth-bader-ginsburg-seat-418152', 'Full Text': 'Trump is expected to make a formal nomination as soon as the middle of next week, according to two people familiar with the plans.\\n\\nJudge Amy Coney Barrett, who joined the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in late 2017 and who Trump considered for an earlier vacancy, is considered the leading contender, according to four people familiar with the matter. She has strong support inside the White House Counsel’s office, which had already vetted her paperwork when she was nominated for the appellate court, according to one of the people.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed Friday night that the nominee will be put to the Senate floor for a vote, though some of his fellow Republicans balked and Democrats quickly called for a delay until after the Nov. 3 election when control of the White House and Senate could flip.\\n\\nTrump was initially left in the dark about Ginsburg’s death while on stage for a campaign rally in Bemidji, Minn., according to White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany.\\n\\nAfter Trump walked off the stage, making a fist pump to the beat of the Village People’s “YMCA,” the president was seen talking to top aides John McEntee and Dan Scavino while he walked over to reporters.\\n\\n“She just died?” Trump asked, touching his ear to hear a reporter ask him about the news as Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer” played in the background from the rally. “Wow, I didn’t know that. You’re telling me now for the first time. She led an amazing life. What else can you say? She was an amazing woman, whether you agreed or not, she was an amazing woman who led an amazing life.

His standing has fallen in many key states, such as Ohio and Iowa, and even in traditionally red states, such as Arizona and Georgia, in both public and campaign polls.\\n\\nThat’s in part because Trump has struggled to craft a coherent case for his reelection and has spent months veering from one hot-button issue to another. But the Supreme Court fight will focus the campaign and energize supporters in a way little else could have, according to interviews with half a dozen Trump allies.\\n\\n\"All this election stuff and we signed an [executive order] on this or that — it doesn\\'t matter,” a White House official said. “This is the election.”\\n\\nTrump frequently touts the hundreds of federal judges, including Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, appointed and confirmed during his tenure, even if he often inflates the total number. It was a point he made again Friday night while on stage in Minnesota.\\n\\n“It shows our voters that’s why they elected him in the first place and that’s why he needs to be reelected,” a Republican close to the president said.\\n\\n“The left is already activated and Trump has coalesced the left faster than they’ve ever been able to do before,” said Lanza, the former campaign aide. “This brings home disaffected Republicans because now they know what’s really at stake.”\\n\\nTrump released a list of potential picks for a vacancy last week, months after the Supreme Court dealt him a series of blows on cases pertaining to hot-button issues that have fired up his base of conservative evangelicals in the past, including immigration, abortion and LGBTQ protections.\\n\\n“Any nominee should have a long record of being a constitutional conservative — applying the law and not making it up,” said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, a conservative group that is in touch with the White House.\\n\\nHe said “it’s doable” for Trump to fill the seat before the election, given that Ginsburg’s nomination took just 42 days from the day President Bill Clinton nominated her to the final Senate vote in the summer of 1993, according to the Congressional Research Service. (The average number of days from nomination to confirmation since 1975 is nearly 70 days.)\\n\\nTrump released his first list of potential picks for a vacancy during the 2016 campaign, a move that helped bring skeptical social conservatives into his camp enough to support his upset victory over Hillary Clinton.\\n\\n“We are not running solely on the Covid response and the economy,” said Dan Eberhart, a major Republican donor and CEO of a drilling services company. “This resets the race.”\\n\\nNancy Cook, Daniel Lippman and Tina Nguyen contributed to this report.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/14/biden-trump-arizona-latinos-414866', 'Full Text': 'Arizona’s growing Latino population, which is overwhelmingly of Mexican descent, is a key reason the state could swing to Democrats in the presidential race for the first time since 1996. Shifting attitudes of white college-educated voters in the suburbs of Maricopa County, and Trump himself, have also contributed to the state’s changing political landscape.\\n\\n“There\\'s room for Joe Biden to grow his support among Latinos in Arizona in this last 50 days,” said Stephanie Valencia, co-founder of Equis Research, which hired GBAO Strategies to conduct the poll. “There\\'s a lot of room for him to continue to make his case to these younger Hispanic men who may be intrigued by Trump but aren\\'t totally sold on voting for him yet.”\\n\\nTrump\\'s support increased by 8 points among Latinos in Arizona compared with the president’s 2019 average in four waves of Equis polling. After weekend events in Nevada, Trump held a Latino roundtable in Phoenix on Monday.\\n\\nValencia attributed the shift to “Trump intrigue” around the president’s business personality. Latino men under the age of 50 represented the greatest statistical bump for Trump since an Equis’ poll from May. The boost for Trump among young Latino men could be a product of a smaller subsample, Valencia said. But even if the true change were half the size, she said, “we would come to the same conclusion: young men have been increasingly moving toward Trump.”\\n\\n“While more than 40 percent say they are supporting Trump today,” Valencia added. “Only 26 percent rate themselves very likely to support him at the end of the day.”\\n\\nAs the election nears, Biden’s campaign has rushed to shore up more Latino support, particularly in the battleground of Florida where he appears to be underperforming Clinton among Latinos in the state. Biden is heading to Florida on Tuesday for a Hispanic heritage event and a veterans\\' roundtable.\\n\\nIn Arizona, Biden’s team is aiming to win at least 70 percent of the Latino vote — the same share of Latinos Sen. Kyrsten Sinema won in her 2018 race when she became the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in Arizona since the 1980s. Latinos will be one of the crucial blocs to determine who wins the pivotal Maricopa County and can help in the Democratic-leaning Pima County.\\n\\n“The path to victory here in Arizona, and in some other states, runs through the Latino community,” Jessica Mejía, Biden’s Arizona state director, told POLITICO earlier this month.\\n\\nArizona Latinos preferred Biden on every issue polled, leading Trump by 44 points on who voters thought would best handle health care issues. When asked who would do a better job of handling the coronavirus, 67 percent of voters preferred Biden, compared with 25 percent for Trump. On immigration, Biden led 67-27 percent. He also led on the economy, with 57 percent compared with Trump\\'s 35 percent.\\n\\nValencia said that when Latinos are given more details about Biden\\'s platform, his favorability rises because the former vice president is still undefined among the group. The poll also found that Democratic Senate candidate Mark Kelly, who has steadily led Republican Sen. Martha McSally in polls, is outperforming Biden with Latinos in the state.\\n\\nArizona Latinos favor Kelly over McSally 65 percent to 27 percent. The poll surveyed 600 registered Latino voters in English and Spanish across Arizona from Aug. 20-Sept. 2, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent.\\n\\nSeventy-one percent of Latinos in Arizona said they’re “very motivated” to vote.\\n\\nBiden’s statewide lead in Arizona, where he is ahead of Trump by an average of 5 points, is also boosted by his numbers with white voters. Biden is ahead of Trump by 22 points with white college-educated voters in the state, according to a monthly tracking poll by Phoenix-based OH Predictive Insights. Trump won that same group by 6 points in 2016. The shift among college-educated white voters has materialized in the suburbs of other battlegrounds as well. But Valencia cautioned Democrats against overconfidence in the Grand Canyon State.\\n\\n\"If the election were held today, Biden would probably win in a place like Arizona based on where he\\'s sitting with white support,” she said. Still, Valencia said, Biden faces a challenge if there\\'s any fluctuation in white voter support — even if it\\'s just a couple of points.\\n\\n\"If Democrats have not done the work to increase support among Latinos to close that gap then that is when there will be trouble,\" Valencia said.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/14/biden-trump-california-fires-climate-change-414753', 'Full Text': 'While Biden and Trump’s divergent attitudes toward climate change were already well established, their comments on Monday only stood to underscore their differences on an issue that has put lives at stake.\\n\\nThe showdown came as historic wildfires have displaced tens of thousands of residents up and down the West Coast, tinged the sky a red-orange hue and created some of the world’s worst air quality in parts of California. At least 35 people are dead across California, Oregon and Washington, and more than 3 million acres of land have been scorched.\\n\\nIn remarks from Wilmington, Del., the former vice president pitched himself as the only choice to combat climate change shortly ahead of Trump’s first visit to view the damage in California from the fires that have been raging for weeks.\\n\\n“If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if we have more America ablaze?” Biden said. “If you give a climate denier four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised when more of America is underwater?”\\n\\nTrump faced a more direct confrontation at his event here in California’s capital, from Gov. Gavin Newsom and Wade Crowfoot, the head of the state’s Natural Resources Agency.\\n\\n“I think we want to work with you to really recognize the changing climate and what it means for our forests and actually work together with that science,” Crowfoot told the president at the wildfire briefing, which featured local and federal officials involved in combating the fires. Crowfoot emphasized to the president that “science is going to be key.”\\n\\nWhile he applauded Trump’s focus on forest management as a method of controlling and fighting wildfires, Crowfoot warned Trump not to “ignore” the science of climate change, arguing that it would be misguided to “sort of put our heads in the sand and think it’s all about vegetation management,” a course of action he said would not ultimately protect Californians.\\n\\nTrump, however, pushed back on Crowfoot’s assessment, telling the secretary that “it’ll start getting cooler, just watch.”\\n\\n“I don’t think the science agrees with you,” Crowfoot responded, to which Trump countered: “I don’t think science knows, actually.”\\n\\nAfter the briefing, Crawfoot fired back at the president on Twitter, posting a graph of California’s average temperature from June to September, with a trendline showing that figure steadily increasing over the last four decades.\\n\\n“It actually won’t get cooler Mr. President. #ClimateChangeIsReal,” Crowfoot wrote.\\n\\nNewsom, a Democrat with whom Trump has had a hot-and-cold relationship, also challenged the president on his views, even as he acknowledged that Trump was unlikely to change them.\\n\\n“I’d be negligent, and this is not — we’ve known each other too long and as you suggest, the working relationship, I value,” he told the president. “We obviously feel very strongly that the hots are getting hotter, the dries are getting drier.”\\n\\n“Something’s happened to the plumbing of the world and we come from a perspective, humbly, where we submit the science is in and observed evidence is self-evident, that climate change is real, and that is exacerbating this,” he continued, urging Trump to “please respect the difference of opinion out here with respect to this fundamental issue of climate change.”\\n\\n“Absolutely,” the president responded.\\n\\nClimate change is playing a role in the severity of the fires, which are expected to increase in frequency in future years. The U.S. endured its fourth-hottest summer ever recorded amid an abnormally dry season, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That helped create the volatile conditions on the heels of the nation’s sixth-warmest winter, as lightning strikes ignited West Coast blazes even before official wildfire season began.\\n\\n“Donald Trump’s climate denial may not have caused these fires and record floods and record hurricanes, but if he gets a second term these hellish events will continue to become more common, more devastating and more deadly,” Biden said on Monday.\\n\\nBiden laid out the consequences of climate change along the nation’s coasts and in suburbs, pointing to the health concerns stemming from wildfires and other natural disasters that disproportionately affect communities of color, as well as the massive costs to the economy and the national security threats posed by sea-level rise.\\n\\n“With every bout of nature’s fury, caused by our own inaction on climate change, more Americans see and feel the devastation, whether they’re in big cities, small towns, on coastlines or farm lands,” Biden said. “It’s happening everywhere and it’s happening now, and it affects us all.”\\n\\nBiden also took aim at Trump’s central campaign theme on law and order, using the same phrasing he has employed when criticizing Trump’s response to the protests that swept across the country to attack him on his lack of action on climate change.\\n\\n“It’s clear that we’re not safe in Donald Trump’s America,” Biden said. “This is Donald Trump’s America. He’s in charge.”\\n\\nTrump has also warned that immigration is threatening U.S. suburbs, an assertion that Biden called “ridiculous” in his remarks.\\n\\n“You know what is actually threatening our suburbs?” he said “Wildfires are burning the suburbs of the West. Floods are wiping out suburban neighbors in the Midwest. Hurricanes are imperiling suburban life along our coast. If we have four more years of Trump’s climate denial, how many suburbs will be burned by wildfires? How many suburban neighborhoods will be flooded out? How many suburbs will have been blown away by superstorms?”\\n\\nBiden positioned Trump’s policies and actions as “backward-looking politics” that will stand to harm the environment, make communities less healthy and hold back economic progress.\\n\\n“It’s a mindset that doesn’t have any faith in the capacity of the American people to compete, to innovate and to win,” Biden said, pointing instead to his own climate plan, which calls for making buildings more energy-efficient, boosting clean-energy jobs and expanding electric transportation.\\n\\n“We have to act as a nation,” Biden said. “It shouldn’t be so bad that millions of Americans live in the shadow of an orange sky and are left asking, ‘Is Doomsday here?’”'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/15/election-season-americans-united-issues-poll-414687', 'Full Text': '“Overall I think Americans want not to be divided as politics are forcing it to be, and that’s probably the biggest message of this poll,” said John Shattuck, director of the Carr Center’s project on Reimagining Rights and Responsibilities in the United States and a former U.S. assistant secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor.\\n\\n“Division is not what most Americans are seeking,” he added.\\n\\nThe findings — including that 8 in 10 Americans agree that “without our freedoms America is nothing” — could be telling in an election that features President Donald Trump and Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, battling each other to claim the mantle of uniter in chief while the country faces coinciding crises of public health and economic and racial justice.\\n\\nSeveral of the rights and freedoms that an overwhelming bipartisan majority viewed as essential to being an American, however, go far beyond those provided directly by the Constitution, like freedom of speech and religion.\\n\\nThe right to clean air and water, for example, was considered important by 93 percent of those surveyed; protection of personal data, by 93 percent; the right to a quality education, by 92 percent; racial equality, by 92 percent; affordable health care, by 89 percent; and the right to a job, by 85 percent.\\n\\nOf 16 rights and values polled, a majority considered every single one either very or somewhat important to being American today.\\n\\nEven issues like immigration (66 percent) and protecting a woman’s right to choose and make decisions affecting her body and personal life (72 percent) — typically viewed as highly divisive — garnered bipartisan support, though with more of a partisan divide.\\n\\nThe survey found its biggest partisan gap on the issue of race and policing. Although more than 6 in 10 agreed that Black Americans and other racial minorities are targets of racism in policing, that total included 84 percent of Democrats compared with just 32 percent of Republicans.\\n\\nTo be sure, many of the issues that Americans agree on are areas that both Trump and Biden — and, more generally, Republicans and Democrats — have campaigned on, though with sometimes drastically different approaches.\\n\\n“The fact that they’re answering these questions in the context of what are the essential rights that are important to being an American today — so in other words this is just not about rights in the abstract, it’s about ‘who are we as Americans?’ — and in a sense this poll provides a pretty clear indication of what it is that people think is most important about being an American,” Shattuck said.\\n\\nIn what could be another telling sign ahead of the November election, overwhelming bipartisan majorities of Americans reported a shift in how they view the role and responsibility of government in protecting rights and the responsibility of citizens to fellow citizens following the events of the past several months — including the coronavirus pandemic, the ensuing economic fallout and mass protests for racial justice.\\n\\nThe poll found that recent events had made 85 percent of Americans think differently about the role and responsibility of the government, including 90 percent of Democrats and 84 percent of Republicans.

And in most cases in which Americans viewed their rights as being in danger, the government and politicians were considered the greatest threat to these rights, along with fellow citizens and corporations.\\n\\nWhile 87 percent agreed that “the government has a responsibility to protect the lives, livelihoods, and rights of all Americans,” more than half — 54 percent — said they believe the government is not doing a good job of protecting those rights, including two-thirds of Democrats and one-third of Republicans.\\n\\nShattuck took a bleak view of Americans’ lack of confidence in their government.\\n\\n“There’s ... a strong belief that rights are under threat and that the principal dangers are coming from government and politicians,” he said, “and I guess my concern here is democracy really is at risk when the very values that Americans believe they have in common are under attack.”\\n\\nWhen it comes to the November election, Shattuck said, “it’s clear that voters are all going to be thinking about their values … so that’s something the candidates are going to have to take into consideration.”\\n\\n“The poll shows that a majority of Americans are fed up with polarization and looking for ways to reimagine the values they have in common — the rights and responsibilities important to being an American today,” he added later.\\n\\nThe project included the nationwide poll as well as focus groups held in Detroit, Phoenix and Atlanta.

Grassroots Democrats are hyperactivated to take on Republican leaders like Graham, who once burnished a moderate reputation but has aligned closely with Trump.\\n\\nEven in a state like South Carolina — which hasn’t voted Democratic for president since 1976 and hasn’t elected a Democratic senator since Fritz Hollings won his final term in 1998 — it’s left even the best-funded Republicans in relatively safe seats drowning under a wave of Democratic cash that is cresting with the upcoming court fight.\\n\\nWhat happened\\n\\nGraham’s pleas have escalated over the past week since Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death, but trouble has been looming for the third-term senator for some time now. Harrison has outraised and outspent Graham in every fundraising period this year, and the polls have the candidates running neck and neck, despite Trump’s lead over Joe Biden in the state.\\n\\nHarrison, the former state Democratic Party chair, brought in $14 million during the second quarter of this year, nearly lapping Graham’s $8.4 million. And the Democrat shelled out $11.8 million during that period, nearly double Graham’s $6.2 million.\\n\\nGraham ended the quarter with $15 million in the bank to just $10.2 million for Harrison. But since then, Harrison’s fundraising has only picked up.\\n\\nHarrison collected a combined $14.1 million from online donors via ActBlue, the Democratic-aligned fundraising platform, in July and August — more than his total fundraising for the whole second quarter, with a month to go in the third quarter. And Harrison’s campaign said he raised $2 million in 48 hours alone earlier this month, after a Quinnipiac University poll showed the two men deadlocked in the race.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Graham — who once pledged that, just as he opposed an election-year Supreme Court nominee from then-President Barack Obama, he would oppose one from a Republican president — is set to play a key role in a new Supreme Court confirmation process, and Harrison\\'s money will likely keep flowing in.\\n\\nGinsburg’s death, and Republicans’ immediate insistence on filling the seat in the current Congress and before the end of Trump’s term, has supercharged Democratic fundraising. Harrison’s campaign declined to disclose how much he’s taken in so far — either in the week since Ginsburg’s passing or in the third quarter to-date.\\n\\nWhat it means\\n\\nGraham isn’t the only Republican being inundated by Democratic cash. The New York Times reported earlier this week that, just to the north, North Carolina Democratic Senate nominee Cal Cunningham had raised $6 million in the days after Ginsburg’s death — more than doubling what his opponent, GOP Sen. Thom Tillis, raised in the entire second quarter. And then there’s Sara Gideon, the Democratic state House speaker in Maine, who has been outraising endangered GOP Sen. Susan Collins for a year and is likely to see yet more money come in, even after Collins said she opposes Trump sending a nominee to the Senate before Election Day.\\n\\nBut Graham’s case is special. At the start of the election cycle, few handicappers gave Harrison a chance to knock off Graham, who has moved from premier Trump opponent and critic during the 2016 campaign to the president’s loyal ally and frequent golf partner.\\n\\nSince he entered the race, Harrison has sought to exploit Graham’s shifting alliances, portraying him as inauthentic and power-hungry. And Graham’s flip-flop on the court appointment — in Oct. 2018, Graham said, “If an opening comes in the last year of President Trump’s term, and the primary process has started, we’ll wait ‘till the next election” before filling the vacancy — has opened him up to new accusations of hypocrisy.\\n\\nBut attacking Graham on the court at the same time he’s presiding over hearings carries some risk, too. It could remind Republican voters who might be skeptical of Graham that he’s the point person in the Senate for moving the nomination. While South Carolina is undergoing the same kinds of demographic changes that have brought neighboring North Carolina and Georgia onto the presidential battlefield, it still leans Republican.\\n\\nGraham’s vulnerability is rooted in his weakness among more conservative voters, who recall his pre-Trump image as a moderate voice: the dealmaking friend of maverick John McCain who pushed immigration reform, voted to confirm Obama’s Supreme Court nominees and trashed Trump. With upscale white voters in and around Charleston and Columbia drifting toward Democrats, Graham now needs the skeptical conservative base to propel him to victory.\\n\\nGraham has attacked Harrison as too liberal for South Carolina, linking him to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and hitting him for his previous work as a lobbyist. And his campaign notes that Harrison hasn\\'t been shy about promoting his website and urging supporters to give him donations, either.\\n\\nIn a six-sentence statement provided for this article, Graham campaign communications director T.W. Arrighi mentioned the URL for Graham\\'s campaign website five times.\\n\\n“The mainstream media is one giant in-kind contribution to the Democratic Party,\" Arrighi said in the two sentences that didn\\'t include the address for Graham\\'s website. \"Jaime Harrison’s hollow campaign relies 100 percent on outside donations and ads because he is hiding from the issues.\"\\n\\nWhat’s next\\n\\nThe end of the third quarter next week means we’ll likely hear from both men soon about their fundraising from July through September. Reports are due to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15.\\n\\nIn the meanwhile, Harrison’s boffo fundraising is giving him a massive advantage on the airwaves. According to Advertising Analytics, he spent $4.2 million on television this week alone — blowing Graham’s $1 million out of the water.\\n\\nAll told, Harrison has already spent $22.8 million and has another $15.5 million on the books, compared with $7.8 million spent and $1.9 million in future reservations for the incumbent.\\n\\n“I am being killed financially,” Graham said on Fox News Channel in his first appearance of the day on Thursday. “This money is because they hate my guts.”\\n\\nHarrison had a cheeky response on Twitter Thursday night: “Anybody else get the sense that @LindseyGrahamSC just realized he\\'s going to lose on November 3rd?”'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/09/cunningham-scandal-rocks-battle-for-senate-428091', 'Full Text': 'POLITICO Dispatch: October 9 First it was hydroxychloroquine. Then it was a vaccine before the election. Now it’s a “miracle” antibody cocktail. POLITICO’s Sarah Owermohle breaks down the science behind President Trump’s latest coronavirus obsession.\\n\\n“This undermines a voter’s confidence in Cal, particularly if you’re in the undecided” camp, Tillis said in an interview from North Carolina, where he is isolated after contracting the coronavirus. “There’s no question that North Carolina is the bellwether state for holding the majority in the Senate.”\\n\\nIf Tillis can mount a stunning comeback, Republicans hope he can save their majority — even if Joe Biden defeats Trump. And though the first-term Republican still sees a path for Trump to win and said nothing critical of the president, he also indicated he’s running as a check on a potential President Biden.\\n\\n“The best check on a Biden presidency is for Republicans to have a majority in the Senate. And I do think \\'checks and balances\\' does resonate with North Carolina voters,” he said.\\n\\nNorth Carolina is one of a handful of top-tier states that will determine the majority. Republicans currently hold a 53-47 advantage, but Democrats are favored to win in Arizona and Colorado. Republicans have an edge in Alabama, and races in Iowa and Maine are highly competitive. Democrats have also pushed races in deeper red territory like Alaska, Montana, South Carolina and Kansas into play, broadening their path back to power.\\n\\nBut Josh Holmes, a close confidant to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said “without question the clearest pathway\" for Democrats to win the Senate was through North Carolina. \"And it looks like Cal Cunningham sexted it away.”\\n\\nSteven Law, who runs Senate Leadership Fund, the powerful super PAC closely aligned with McConnell, conceded the race had “kind of frozen into place with a gap in polling between Tillis and Cunningham.” But now he sees a shake-up.\\n\\n“It changes our potential for winning this race. I wouldn’t say it’s decisive, but it is a key ingredient. With the potential for winning North Carolina, I think it could build a bridge to holding the majority,” Law said.\\n\\nA Democrat familiar with recent polling said that while voters are aware of the affair, and the race may tighten, “people are not shifting their support.” And Democrats scoff at the possibility voters will punish Cunningham after Trump has been repeatedly accused of sexual misconduct, including the president\\'s own words in the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, which was released a month before the 2016 election.\\n\\n“It\\'s a little bit hard for me to take seriously the Republican shock and horror about whatever this guy did,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). “Pretty much whatever any Democratic candidate could do has been eclipsed by what Donald Trump does every day that Republicans cover for.”\\n\\nBut Tillis says this is different because Cunningham was making character, integrity and a military background such an integral part of his race. Last Friday, outlets reported that Cunningham sent sexually suggestive texts to Arlene Guzman Todd, a California PR executive and the wife of an Army veteran. Guzman Todd later confirmed at least one intimate encounter with Cunningham \"during a period of marital separation.\" Cunningham is an Army reservist, and the Army said this week it is investigating the allegations.\\n\\n“The whole premise of Cal Cunningham’s campaign has imploded over the past four days. So clearly it’s going to be a factor,” Tillis said. “I’m not going to call on him to get out of the race. I’m calling on him to be transparent and provide a full explanation.”\\n\\nCunningham has resumed campaign activities after Tillis’s coronavirus infection forced the two candidates to quarantine. He lashed Tillis for not clinching a deal on more coronavirus relief on Thursday in a news release that made no mention of Cunningham’s cloud of scandal.\\n\\nRachel Petri, a spokeswoman for Cunningham, said Tillis is behind in the race due to his positions on health care and “colossally botching the response to this pandemic.”\\n\\n“Now he’s trying to exploit a personal matter to make desperate attacks in hopes it saves his political career,” Petri said.\\n\\nRepublicans are now running ads against Cunningham’s indiscretion and judgment, but they’re being outspent. Cunningham’s campaign is set to swamp Tillis on the airwaves over the next week. Among outside groups, Democrats have slightly more money booked for TV ads than Republicans, according to data from Advertising Analytics.\\n\\nNorth Carolina is a major presidential swing state — but in polls prior to the past week, Tillis was running behind Trump. His evolution from a senator who stood against Trump’s national emergency on the border and negotiated on immigration with Democrats to among the most steadfast Trump defenders left him vulnerable. Last fall, he was squeezed by conservatives who saw him as a weak defender of the president, then appealed to the right to ward off a brief primary challenge.\\n\\nBut with Cunningham staggering, Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said there’s now “reason for us to be at least hopeful” about keeping the chamber.\\n\\n“When you set yourself up and raise the bar really high for yourself and crash and burn at your own hand, that’s a pretty hard thing to overcome,” he said of Cunningham. “The entire majority of the United States Senate could rest not just on this one race, but this one issue.”\\n\\nDemocrats say their core message that Tillis is too close to Trump and too hellbent on scrapping Obamacare will not change.\\n\\n“Republicans are in a really tough place nationally, and they\\'re trying to hang on. But what they can\\'t lose sight of is what matters most to the voters,” said JB Poersch, who runs the Democratic Senate Majority PAC, which is heavily invested in North Carolina.\\n\\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Thursday declined to comment on the race but pointed to a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee statement backing Cunningham. John Verdejo, a Democratic National Committee member in North Carolina, said there was disappointment over the affair, but not to the point that people are “turning their back on Cal Cunningham.”\\n\\n“I kind of look at it as an act of desperation,” he said of Republicans’ new tactics. “They have nothing else to run on.”\\n\\nTillis would probably be in even better shape politically had he not contracted coronavirus last week, one of three recent infections in the Senate GOP. He was photographed without a mask at a White House reception for Trump\\'s Supreme Court pick, Amy Coney Barrett, though he wore one while outside at her nomination announcement.\\n\\nTillis is set to return to Washington next week to push through Barrett\\'s nomination from his perch on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said in the interview that everyone in the room had been tested for Covid-19 and called his infection a “testament that you should never let your guard down.” Asked whether Cunningham might have let his guard down in a close Senate race, Tillis scoffed.\\n\\n“He let his family down. And he let his supporters down for months. And it just happened to come to light,” Tillis said. “He didn’t let his guard down. He made a decision.”\\n\\n'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/29/trump-debate-performance-2016-422838', 'Full Text': 'You can’t have a country if you don’t have a real border!\\n\\nClinton sat down, chastened. This was not going to be easy. “That’s a devastating argument,” she said. “I have not created 100,000 jobs. And maybe nobody knows who Larry Kudlow is but he’s telling you he’s the expert!”\\n\\n“She immediately, and throughout, saw the power of the hundred-thousand-job argument,” Reines said recently in an interview, “and how it helped Trump steamroll over 17 non-businesspeople in the Republican primaries.\"\\n\\nAfter watching hours of Trump’s debates from 2015 and 2016, what comes across in hindsight is that he had an under-appreciated style, strategy, and message. He was not the Donald Trump of Twitter, where he launches his crudest attacks. He was not the Donald Trump of MAGA rallies, where he feeds off the crowd and plays a role that is a mix of demagogue, right-wing pundit, and entertainer.\\n\\nThe matchup with Biden will be much different. Trump is an unpopular incumbent with a record to defend. He no longer has as clear a message as he did in 2016. Biden has the benefit of four extra years to study Trump.\\n\\nBut the conventional wisdom about Trump arriving in Cleveland Tuesday as a manic and extremely, well, Trumpy, debater could be wrong. Trump won the Republican nomination partly on the strength of his debate appearances. And while post-debate polls were generally favorable to Hillary in 2016, Trump’s three general election debates were crucial to his victory.\\n\\nMaybe everything is different this year, but the debates offer the best — and last — opportunity for Trump to turn around the race.\\n\\nAttention at all costs\\n\\nWatching the first Republican presidential primary debates of the 2016 campaign with the benefit of experiencing Trump on the national stage for five years is revelatory.\\n\\nMost of the other Republican candidates share an understanding of what conservatism means and what presidential candidates should look and sound like.\\n\\nThe media moderators share an understanding of what a candidate can and can’t get away with.\\n\\nSince we now know the ending, watching Jeb Bush talk about his optimistic vision for America or seeing Chris Wallace react indignantly when Trump bulldozes through a question with a flurry of bombast and nonsense can be painful. Watching these old clips now, it’s mind-boggling how easy it was for Trump to play the media and his opponents.\\n\\nThe tone was set at the very first debate on Aug. 6, 2015, in Cleveland. Fox’s Bret Baier asks if any of the 10 candidates on stage is not willing to pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee or promise not to mount an independent campaign in the fall, something Trump had flirted with publicly.\\n\\nTrump, standing in the center because he’s already at the top of the polls, is wearing his candidate uniform of blue suit and extra long shiny red tie. He looks around, sees that nobody else is raising his hand and puts his own in the air. The crowd loudly boos him and Trump responds with an exaggerated shrug and outstretched palms.\\n\\nNaturally, the moderators, channeling the outrage of the Republican audience, ignore the other nine candidates and press Trump on his supposed heresy.\\n\\n“To be clear, you’re standing on a Republican primary debate stage,” Baier says. The camera zooms in on Trump and his face fills the screen.\\n\\n“I fully understand,” Trump interjects. And he did. It was everyone else in politics and media who didn’t.\\n\\nAt the end of the first debate Bush wags his finger at Trump’s obnoxious tone. “We don’t have time for tone,” Trump responds.\\n\\nTrump kept himself as the center of attention at the next 11 debates. Aside from a couple of days in November 2015, he was the polling leader for the rest of the primary. Moderators would challenge him by noting what “experts say” or asking him to “share your proof with the American people” about some absurd claim and Trump would talk about why “we don’t win anymore” or how the press is “a very dishonest lot.”\\n\\nWhenever Trump would be challenged about his personal criticisms of other candidates he would escalate. “I never attacked him on his looks and believe me there’s plenty of subject matter there,” he said about Rand Paul in the second debate. The purpose was to remain the focus at all costs, and it worked. The rules said that if another candidate mentioned you then you got to respond. Trump made sure he was mentioned.\\n\\nAt the third debate, in October, an exasperated Mike Huckabee was asked if Trump had the character to be president. “As few questions as I’ve got, the last one I need is to give him some more time!” he said. Someone was finally onto the strategy, but it was too late.\\n\\nHe lies: When Jeb Bush accurately says Trump lobbied him on casino gambling in Florida, Trump admonishes, “Don’t make things up!” He cites unnamed experts endorsing his views: “Some of the greatest scholars agree with me,” he tells Carly Fiorina about birthright citizenship. He brags about his scandals: “I used the laws of the country to my benefit,” he said of his company’s multiple bankruptcies. “I’m sorry.”\\n\\nA more reserved Trump\\n\\nBy the general election, Trump had most of the Republican Party behind him and his ragtag operation had some operatives with traditional campaign experience guiding it, including Kellyanne Conway, who convinced him to tone things down.\\n\\nIf watching the Republican primary debates of 2015 and 2016 is jarring for how effective Trump was at using a shock jock schtick to dominate a political campaign, watching the 2016 general election debates is jarring for how relatively restrained Trump could be.\\n\\nSimply commanding the spotlight— crucial in a 17-candidate field — was no longer a wise strategy in a two-person race. But watching the debates knowing that Trump would defeat Clinton by winning over white working-class voters reveals Trump to be cannier in his messaging than he was given credit for at the time.\\n\\nThe issues that flummoxed Clinton during debate prep proved to be deadly. “In 2016 he had his message killers: immigration, trade, Obamacare, and corruption in Washington,” Reines said.\\n\\nIn the early moments of the first debate, which was the most-watched period of the three matchups, the two candidates outline their economic visions. Clinton was cogent and talked about a series of specific policies like raising the minimum wage, paid family leave, affordable child care and debt-free college. There was a dash of populism when she talked about “having the wealthy pay their fair share” and closing corporate loopholes.\\n\\nIt all seems so clear now, but it’s like watching a horror movie where you can’t believe another victim is going to fall prey to the same mistakes that Rubio and Jeb made when they were drowned in the lake by Trump.\\n\\nWhen it’s Trump’s turn to talk about the economy, he launches into a simplistic riff about the world taking advantage of Americans. “Our jobs are fleeing the country,” Trump begins. He blames it all on Mexico and China and the other foreign countries using America as a piggy bank to rebuild their own countries. The Obama administration’s refusal “to fight them” is the problem. On the issues that he did have details about, they were skeletal, like his promise to cut corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 15 percent, which he said would be an explosive “job creator” would “be a beautiful thing to watch.”\\n\\nClinton was cerebral and hemmed in by only proposing things she genuinely believed were possible to pass into law as president.\\n\\nTrump was visceral and unencumbered by any sense of what might work or what was possible to get through Congress.\\n\\nThere were sporadic outbursts from Trump through the three debates that had nothing to do with his four pillars. He threatened to jail Clinton. During the second debate, in the wake of the release of the Access Hollywood tape, when it seemed his candidacy might implode, he made a spectacle of the evening by inviting to the event several women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault or sexual harassment.\\n\\nBut what comes across watching these events back-to-back is the power of Trump’s populism and demagoguery and the relative restraint he showed compared to what we have seen on his Twitter feed and at his press conferences for much of this year.\\n\\nReines, who has studied Trump’s debating style as much as anyone, agreed with that assessment. “He had his four pillars, and a well honed attack on Hillary,” he said. “He spent nominal time defending himself even in the face of the most egregious incidents, like Access Hollywood.”\\n\\nThere was a Trump formula for almost every question a moderator posed that might be uncomfortable for him. In the first debate, Lester Holt asked Trump about releasing his tax returns, a topic certain to come up tonight. His response set the pattern he would use for all three events.\\n\\n“I don\\'t mind releasing — I\\'m under a routine audit,” he said. “And it\\'ll be released. And — as soon as the audit\\'s finished, it will be released.” Trump then bragged about how he made $694 million the previous year. Then he pivoted to discussing trade deficits and the “political hacks negotiating our trade deals.” He finished by proposing he release his tax returns “when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted.”\\n\\nReines described that three-step response that Trump patented in 2016 as, “word salad, weird digression, I’m great and she’s terrible.”\\n\\nThere is a good case that the political dynamics of 2020 are completely different. It’s always easier in American politics to run as an outsider against the establishment. Successful presidential candidates as different as Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama all profited from that strategy. Trump now has the burden of trying to defend an objectively poor record on the central issue of 2020: his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. His message is not as simple and clear as it was in 2020.\\n\\nThough it\\'s perhaps a tad self-serving, Reines has become convinced that Trump\\'s message was so effective in 2016 that no Democrat would have fared better than Hillary Clinton. He described some revelatory moments during debate prep when he was doing his best to inhabit the character of Trump but all that was really coming out were the words.\\n\\n\"What’s scary is that I’m dressed like him and I have the Trump mannerisms, but I’m not crazy,\" he said. \"I’m still Philippe Reines. And when you hear me saying what he says, you see the power of it. Even without any of the crazy stuff. It’s why Biden or Bernie would not have beaten him.\"\\n\\nIn his view, the fact that Trump has a real governing record and is unpopular — 45 percent job approval — changes everything. Clinton struggled to make the case that Trump would be the wrong person to lead the country through a crisis, and his act was still a novelty to many Americans willing to give him a chance. But Biden has the benefit of being able to ignore much of Trump\\'s familiar histrionics and instead focus clearly on his record.\\n\\nReines\\'s two pieces of advice for Biden were \"not to overthink it\" — Trump is not that sophisticated — and to serve as a narrator of Trump\\'s tactics for viewers at home by declaring early on that what they will hear from Trump Tuesday night can\\'t be trusted.\\n\\n\"He has to beat him to the punch,\" Reines said. \"They don’t have opening statements, but I would start with \\'I’ve served with and for eight presidents before you, and I never thought I would say this to a president but most of what you hear from him tonight will be false.’\"\\n\\nStill, last time around Trump learned to master and dominate the debates in the Republican primary, and he was extraordinarily effective against someone as skilled as Hillary Clinton in the three general election debates. He shouldn’t be underestimated.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/07/susan-collins-maine-campaign-426815', 'Full Text': 'POLITICO Dispatch: October 7 Is Susan Collins making her \"last stand?\" POLITICO\\'s Burgess Everett breaks down why Sen. Collins is on track to lose her seat representing Maine — and how the race marks the end of an era for moderates.\\n\\nThe fusillade of charges comes in response to a barrage of anti-Collins ads that portray her as in the pocket of big business, timid in the face of President Donald Trump and worst of all, losing the support of the state’s famously independent voters. The race has featured nearly $90 million in TV ads and will see another $25 million or more over the home stretch, according to an analysis of media buys, making it easily the most expensive race in Maine history.\\n\\nCollins’ 24 years in the Senate, where she carefully cultivated the image of a pragmatic centrist, is now in serious danger of being washed away under a flood of ads and rising anti-Trump fervor. And if she goes down, the Senate Republican majority may go with her.\\n\\nCollins has not led a public poll since July and is increasingly viewed by handicappers as an underdog after crushing her competition in her last three election campaigns. Poll averages show Gideon leading by 6 points, though a Bangor Daily News poll on Tuesday showed her trailing by just one point. The state uses ranked-choice voting, adding to the complexities in the race.\\n\\nCollins would not concede anything, only offering that the race is “essentially tied.”\\n\\n“It’s very frustrating because it’s backed by so much money. And it\\'s been going on for two years now: Non-stop negative ads. That eventually it pulls you down,” Collins said of the campaign against her. “What\\'s amazing is that I’m still going to win.”\\n\\nGideon’s campaign declined to respond to Collins in an interview, asserting her schedule was too packed. Typically, challengers to high-profile senators will do any media they can get to boost their message, but Gideon seems happy not to make waves.\\n\\nPolls have given Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon a small edge. | Robert F. Bukaty/AP Photo\\n\\n“Senator Collins’ votes for 181 of Trump’s far-right judicial nominees, for the corporate tax giveaway that put Mainers’ health care in jeopardy and her continued refusal to stand up to Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump show just how much she\\'s changed after 24 years in Washington,” said Maeve Coyle, a Gideon spokeswoman, in a statement. “Her desperate, misleading attacks on Sara make clear that she’s willing to do anything to stay there.”\\n\\nCollins built her brand to withstand the political winds no matter which way they blew, with a focus on deal-cutting, accessibility and delivering for her state. She will be the Senate Appropriations chairman if her party can keep the Senate. And Collins almost surely must win for there to be any hoping of preventing a Democratic takeover.\\n\\nRepublicans describe Collins as wounded but still in it. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said Democrats have “have hit Susan so hard they’re working now on scar tissue.”\\n\\n“She can survive the onslaught. But it’s a challenge,” said Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), an ally.\\n\\nCollins’ precarious position reflects how it’s become borderline impossible to carry on as a middle-of-the-road Republican in the Trump era. Her appeals to the dwindling center incite mockery on the left, particularly when she gently chides the president. On the right, conservatives are upset about her opposition to filling the vacant Supreme Court seat, though former Gov. Paul LePage (R), never a robust Collins fan, said people should still “pinch your nose and vote for her.”\\n\\nCollins had been pushing hard for another relief package to combat the coronavirus and deliver aid to millions of jobless Americans, but Trump killed negotiations with Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a tweet Tuesday — a “huge mistake,” Collins said. From immigration reform to background checks on gun sales, it was just the latest example of Trump and Collins working at cross purposes.\\n\\n“Bipartisan work has become harder. I don’t think this president has helped make things any easier,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska).\\n\\nMurkowski herself is “struggling” with whether to support Trump and said she would be “very lonely” if Collins lost. The two make up the sum of moderate Republicans currently serving in the Senate.\\n\\nA significant factor in Collins’ race is also the one she is most reluctant to address: Trump’s reelection campaign. She refuses to reveal whether she will vote for Trump — a tactic that vulnerable Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) used successfully four years ago, albeit when Trump wasn’t yet president.\\n\\nCollins did not support Trump in 2016. But she dismissed the issue in an interview, saying that “nobody” asked her about it on a recent swing through the state.\\n\\n“I wish the president would not tweet insults. There’s a lot about his style that is completely opposite of mine. But that doesn’t mean that he isn’t right on some issues,” she said, listing his aggressive trade policies toward China and his focus on tax cuts.\\n\\n“My personal presidential preference, I do not believe is an important factor in this race. I’m not saying that the left is not trying to tie me to Donald Trump … they clearly are,” Collins said. But with her votes to save the Affordable Care Act and against some of Trump’s more controversial nominees like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, “my independence is the same as it’s always been.”\\n\\nBetsy Sweet, who ran against Gideon in the Senate Democratic primary from the left, said both candidates are running “incessant” attack ads and talking “very little about what they are for.”\\n\\nGideon’s “ahead, and I think there definitely is caution there in terms of talking to people and being involved in public debates,” Sweet said of the campaign. “There’s a little bit of: ‘Let’s keep our head down.’”\\n\\nThat’s not a luxury Collins has as she fights her own party on a Supreme Court vacancy and pushes for a deal on a new coronavirus package. And every time Trump finds himself mired in controversy, she’s asked to opine.\\n\\nStuck in Washington last week when she was supposed to be touring Maine, Collins wants to make the race a side-by-side comparison between a four-term senator and a statehouse speaker. She said Gideon is “not doing her job in Maine” as speaker by adjourning the legislature and not doing more to address the pandemic, though Democrats say the blame lies with state Republicans for declining to participate in reconvening.\\n\\nWeekly Score Your guide to the year-round campaign cycle.

Senate Republicans’ campaign arm launched an ad Tuesday accusing Gideon of a “cover up.”\\n\\n“Sara’s own spokesperson conceded that Sara had known about this for a long time. And actually said that Sara told Dillon Bates that, should [the scandal] become public, he would have to go. Now, why, whether or not it became public would be the triggering event, and why she didn’t ask for an investigation, are legitimate issues,” Collins said.\\n\\nGideon had been aware of the rumors before they became public and was the first legislator to call on Bates to resign, but did not call for an investigation, according to local news outlet WCSH.\\n\\nIn their last debate, Gideon accused Collins of pushing the courts “far to the right” by supporting most of Trump’s judges. And Collins\\' vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court provided a huge jolt in the push to defeat her. Now Collins finds herself standing with Murkowski against the efforts of 51 GOP colleagues trying to fill the vacancy filled by the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\\n\\nCollins keeps a photo of her and other female senators alongside Ginsburg and former Justice Sandra Day O’Connor in her Senate hideaway. Collins quickly came out against filling Ginsburg’s Supreme Court seat before election, but her position was ignored by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is moving quickly to confirm Amy Coney Barrett.\\n\\nThe episode shows Collins’ willingness to break with her party — and the limits of a lonely moderate’s influence in an increasingly conservative GOP.\\n\\n“I was saddened by [Ginsburg’s] death to start with.

Despite boosterism by top Florida Republicans to put Lagoa on the high court, her strategy differs from Brett Kavanaugh, who had legions of supporters speaking on his behalf when he was up for nomination.\\n\\nBut one long-time acquaintance of Lagoa said that the “case was an example of a government agency not adhering to the plain meaning of the text.” Another Florida attorney who knows Lagoa said she told him the case helped form her philosophy and that her “reverence for separation of powers crystalized as the result of the events.” The two spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not want to comment publicly while Lagoa was still under consideration by the White House.\\n\\nLagoa, who has been a member of the conservative Federalist Society, touched on her philosophy briefly during her investiture to the Florida Supreme Court, where she sat for several months before landing on the federal appeals court last year. She said her parent’s refugee experience shaped her thinking on the law.\\n\\n“We understand what it means when individual liberties, respect for private property and basic human rights are abandoned by government,” Lagoa said during the ceremony, held May 2019 in Tallahassee.\\n\\nLagoa was the first Hispanic woman and first Cuban American woman to serve on the Florida Supreme Court, to which she was nominated by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. Lagoa also spent 12 years on a state appeals court after an appointment by then-Gov. Jeb Bush. She authored nearly 500 decisions and weighed in on thousands of others.\\n\\nLagoa has ruled against the government at times, notably in a case in which the state appeals court tossed a drug conviction after concluding police did a warrantless search. But, twice on the state Supreme Court, she authored opinions upholding DeSantis’ powers to suspend public officials by contending the state Supreme Court was limited in its ability to review such actions.\\n\\nLagoa was part of a federal appeals court ruling this month that upheld a contentious Florida law that requires felons to pay outstanding court debts in order to be eligible to register to vote. A group of Democratic senators — including vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris — said Lagoa had an obligation to recuse herself because she had sat on the state Supreme Court when it considered a different case tied to the law.\\n\\nThe decision to push for the removal of Gonzalez 20 years ago by federal authorities — including then Attorney General Janet Reno, the former Miami-Dade state attorney — enraged the Cuban American community. It seeped into that year’s presidential race and is viewed as one possible reason that then Vice President Al Gore lost to George W. Bush. Bush defeated Gore in Florida by just 537 votes after the U.S. Supreme Court halted an ongoing recount.\\n\\nHow much of a role it played is up for debate, but in a year when the election was essentially tied, every vote counted.\\n\\nThe Elian Gonzalez debate “happened in the spring and there were many other factors influencing the election after that,” Jeb Bush, who was Florida’s governor at the time, said in an email to POLITICO. “But how the Clinton administration took the kid out of the home in Little Havana did not help Al Gore.”\\n\\nNow the Gonzalez case seems like a prelude to the polarizing battles that swept up the country since then. After the federal raid, then-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani blasted the Border Patrol agents as “storm troopers using guns.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/25/chamber-of-commerce-senate-democrats-421990', 'Full Text': 'The remarks come with Democrats leading Republican senators in the polls in several key states — and with the pro-business, traditionally conservative Chamber facing a precarious moment.\\n\\nThe group has clashed with President Donald Trump on issues including trade and immigration and is now facing an internal revolt over its decision to endorse a slate of vulnerable freshmen House Democrats for reelection. The move represented a major shift for the Chamber, which has long endorsed and funded Republican candidates and backed few Democrats in recent years. In 2014, the Chamber’s political director declared that making McConnell the majority leader was the group’s “number one priority.”\\n\\nThe organization has aired commercials backing several Senate GOP candidates in this election.

Skip the waitlist here.\\n\\nTech of the Town\\n\\nTONIGHT’S THE NIGHT — The first presidential debate between President Donald Trump and former veep Joe Biden is set for 9 p.m. ET, and social media platforms are already bracing for potential problems. Twitter, for example, stressed Monday that it’ll be using a combination of human monitoring and automation to keep a close watch on trending content, hashtags and accounts that might violate site policies and to offer users accurate voter registration resources and authoritative information as context for inaccuracies from the candidates. (Monday’s MT looked at what tech talk could come up; read that here, ICYMI.)\\n\\nTODAY: CORNYN TEAMS UP WITH MANCHIN ON SECTION 230 REFORM BILL — Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) today is slated to introduce his long-awaited bill to revamp Section 230 with a key Republican co-sponsor in tow: Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, according to Manchin’s office.\\n\\n— Cornyn, long seen as a leading contender to succeed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as the chamber’s top Republican, gives Manchin a powerful new ally in his push to change the liability shield, which has come under fire from both parties.\\n\\n— The skinny on the proposal: Manchin’s bill, as Cristiano first reported Friday, would require companies to report to federal authorities suspicious activity by users linked to major crimes or risk losing their Section 230 protections, which shields them from lawsuits for hosting third-party content and for taking steps to combat noxious material. It’s now the third bipartisan Senate bill to revamp Section 230 introduced this Congress, joining the PACT Act, S. 4066 (116), and the EARN It Act, S. 3398 (116). All three now have the backing of a member of Senate leadership or of a committee chairman, making each a legit threat to Section 230.\\n\\n— Not a fan? The tech industry: The Internet Association — a leading tech trade association that counts Amazon, Google and Facebook as members — is already voicing concern. “The bill would put online services into the impossible position of determining what is or isn’t evidence of a crime, with crippling liability for failing to make the correct determination,” IA Deputy General Counsel Elizabeth Banker said in a statement.\\n\\nALSO TODAY: HOUSE TO VOTE ON EMERGING TECH BILLS — A number of tech and telecom bills are set to get consideration on the House floor today, with passage likely. They include: Rep. Jerry McNerney’s (D-Calif.) Consumer Safety Technology Act, H.R. 8128 (116), which would direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission to use artificial intelligence to identify consumer product-related injuries; Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers’ (R-Wash.) American COMPETE Act, H.R. 8132 (116), which aims to boost U.S. innovation in emerging technologies like AI and blockchain; and H.R. 1289 (116), which would prevent consumers’ phone numbers from getting reassigned in the wake of disasters.\\n\\nThe U.S. Capitol is seen in Washington, D.C. | Samuel Corum/Getty Images\\n\\n— And amid renewed talks, House Democrats floated a slimmed-down version of their coronavirus relief package, which still spends billions of dollars for broadband connectivity.\\n\\nTHE PERILS OF ZOOM HEARINGS — On the plus side, federal court hearings held via Zoom mean you can wear sweatpants. On the downside, so can everyone else. Monday’s Apple and Epic Games hearing drew a crowd — the Northern District of California reached its 500-person cap on Zoom more than 45 minutes beforehand, leaving many tech and court reporters (including POLITICO’s) without access. Intense public interest in the WeChat ban had a similar result: a Sept. 17 hearing in the same court with a 100-person limit filled up so quickly, the court increased the capacity to 500 for a follow-up hearing the next day (that one also maxed out).\\n\\n— Livestreams: The court forbids any recording of hearings, and a notice on the California court’s website specifically calls out taking screen-shots or any other form of audio or visual copying. But a few gamers took the risk anyway, streaming the court proceedings on Twitch and YouTube for others to watch. At various points during the hearing, more than 1,600 people were watching those offshoot livestreams.\\n\\n— Cameras in the court: The CARES Act authorized the federal courts to conduct business via teleconference and offered $6.5 million in additional funding. In April, the Judiciary asked Congress for $36.5 million more to help with additional health screening and technology enhancements during the pandemic. (Some in Congress have long pushed for the judicial branch to offer televised hearings. While few U.S. federal courts offer video, the U.S. Supreme Court and several of the appeals courts provide audio of arguments.)\\n\\nBROADBAND LAND: TRUMP ADMIN TO BOOST 5G WORKFORCE TRAINING — The Department of Labor explicitly named 5G wireless network building as a goal when recently designating the Wireless Infrastructure Association as an industry intermediary to help train wireless workers — something that the association has long clamored for amid plans to spend millions of dollars on the effort. “We need to put the 5G job skills effort on steroids, and this is a nice big pill,” Jonathan Adelstetin, the group’s president, told John on Monday.\\n\\n— Adelstein expects labor demand will remain high and as necessary as ever given the wireless industry\\'s recent interest in complex new network architecture ideas like opening the radio access networks (“open RAN”). “There’s going to be a crunch,” Adelstein maintained, pointing to the wireless carriers “firing a once,” the entry of new 5G player Dish Network, and builds related to the FCC’s recent auction of Citizens Broadband Radio Service airwaves.\\n\\n— One lobbying fight to watch: Adelstein said that if Congress moves on a broadband infrastructure package, lawmakers should include legislation aimed at training more 5G network builders.\\n\\nTHE VIEW FROM EUROPE: SCHREMS II, PRIVACY SHIELD FALLOUT — With Ireland\\'s privacy agency at the finish line of likely deciding to forbid Facebook from using so-called “standard contractual clauses” to move data from the European Union to the United States, Max Schrems and his nonprofit organization, NOYB, asked dozens of other companies how they planned to keep the transatlantic data taps on.\\n\\n— Their responses: Almost everyone (from Apple and Microsoft to Google and Facebook) said they would continue to use contractual clauses until told otherwise, adding that they were seeking guidance from EU regulators on how best to proceed. \"It seems so far too many EU companies point at the regulators and the regulators point at them to get going,\" Schrems told Morning Tech. \"At the same time, the U.S. data importers spread the message that there would be no problem.\"\\n\\n— Not a problem… until there is one: Much will depend on Dublin\\'s decision on how to handle Facebook\\'s use of its own contractual clauses. If — which seems likely — the agency says such transfers are illegal, expect the legal mechanisms of other companies based in Ireland and across Europe to come under that same scrutiny. So at some point, those companies, too, could find themselves with little (if any) option to move information from the EU to the U.S.\\n\\n— Next up on the calendar: Facebook\\'s judicial review case on Dublin\\'s likely ruling against the company\\'s standard contractual clauses is set for December 15. The court hearing will last up to four days; a judge\\'s decision is expected in early January.\\n\\nA message from Masterworks:\\n\\nTransitions\\n\\nTracey Breeden, former head of women’s safety and gender-based violence operations at Uber, is joining Match Group as its new head of safety and social advocacy. … Rinki Sethi, who has worked at Rubrik, IBM and Palo Alto Networks, has joined Twitter as its new CISO. … Michael Dugan, former chief technology officer at Hearst Magazines, was appointed chief technology officer for the digital publisher G/O Media. … Vilas Dhar was named the first president of the Patrick McGovern Foundation. … Marcin Cichy was appointed Access Partnership’s senior advisor for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\\n\\nSilicon Valley Must Reads\\n\\nInside Russia’s state-media propaganda machine: “Russia\\'s state media actively promoted Brexit supporters and undermined Hillary Clinton\\'s 2016 U.S. presidential bid as part of a yearslong campaign to sow doubt among Western democracies, according to almost two dozen current and former journalists for RT, the Kremlin-backed outlet,” POLITICO reports.\\n\\nTikTok decision: “The Trump administration ‘likely’ exceeded its legal authority with its order to ban TikTok downloads in the U.S. and impose other restrictions on the video-sharing platform, a federal judge wrote in a legal opinion disclosed Monday,” per Cristiano.\\n\\nA message from Masterworks: History shows adding blue-chip art can boost portfolio stability.

Indeed, even as Trump, too, talks in the direst tones about the consequences of a Biden victory, he doesn’t seem to have absorbed the message.\\n\\nIf the existence of the country itself is on the ballot in November, why not prepare better for the debates? Why not use Twitter exclusively for messages that advance his cause rather than detract from them? Why waste any time on petty animosities and distractions? Why not write down a health care plan and a Covid-19 plan to blunt Biden’s most potent issues?\\n\\nWhy not, in short, do at least a few things that are uncomfortable or un-natural in the cause of, you know, saving the country from imminent political destruction?\\n\\nOf course, by this point, even asking the questions seem naive, although there were times in 2016 when Trump modulated his behavior enough to make a difference.\\n\\nPrior to the first Trump-Biden debate, Ryan Lizza wrote a compelling piece for Politico looking back at the 2016 Trump-Hillary clashes and making the case that Trump was relatively disciplined and kept coming back to his central themes.\\n\\nLast week’s debate last week was different. No doubt, Trump came in with a theory of the case—he wanted to steamroll Biden and make him crack. Nonetheless, the president gave in to his anger and contempt for Biden, and blew himself up in the course of trying to demolish the former Vice President. If Biden was calculatedly evasive and canned, Trump was profligate and underprepared—the way he almost always is.\\n\\nAs my colleague, Ramesh Ponnuru points out, in 2016 Trump fastened on issues that voters cared about more than the political elite did—trade and deindustrialization, immigration, and PC.\\n\\nThis time, he’s devoting inordinate time to matters that obsess him, not the average voter.\\n\\nThe sources of the Russia investigation should, as a matter of basic accountability, be established and disclosed. But no one who is not already a Trump voter cares about dubious investigatory decisions from four years ago.\\n\\nNor is anyone as exercised as the president about unfair things that might be said about him on cable TV programs.\\n\\nTrump has waged a low-intensity campaign against masks, for no good reason. If masks and their more zealous advocates are annoying, they are also a low-cost, relatively easy intervention to diminish spread of the virus, and a popular one. By setting himself against masks, largely on aesthetic grounds, Trump further opened himself up to charges that he doesn’t take the virus seriously. Now, that case against him has even more political salience with his own illness and the White House outbreak.\\n\\nConsider, on the other side of the ledger, how the economy is the top issue in the election and how Trump, by and large, leads on it. Still, there has been no sustained case that Biden’s program, including the largest tax increase in more than half a century, will hamper investment and growth. On what should be his foremost advantage, Trump has taken the famous James Carville adage and turned it on its head, “It’s everything else, stupid.”\\n\\nIf the time eventually comes for recriminations after a defeat in November (not a certainty, even at this late date), Trump’s hard-core supporters will have plenty of places to point—to a once-in-a-century pandemic, to an overwhelmingly hostile media, and to a poorly predicated special counsel investigation that ate up time and political capital, among other things.\\n\\nBe all of that as it may, Trump won’t have been stabbed in the back; he will have committed a form of political hara-kiri because he found it easier and more enjoyable than exercising a modicum of self-discipline.\\n\\nIf Trump loses, the story isn’t going to be what was done to him, rather what he did to himself.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/09/17/trump-suburbs-wisconsin-415148', 'Full Text': 'If there is a “Suburban Lifestyle Dream”—if there is a throwback Leave it to Beaver existence still offered in modern America—it is found in Cedarburg, Wisconsin, an idyllic hamlet nestled in the wooded splendor of Ozaukee County. Cedarburg is impossibly comfortable and categorically safe, its rates of crime and unemployment impossibly low, the sort of place where people leave front doors unlocked all day long. Downtown is straight out of Norman Rockwell’s daydreams, an elm-lined stretch of Americana where locals strut through morning power-walks and sip designer coffee and duck into boutique spice and wine stores. The only trouble in sight is a dog doing its business on an immaculate flowerbed.\\n\\nThis is a very different type of Trump Country from the one most commonly mythologized—just swap out the camouflage for cardigans, the flannels for Patagonia fleeces. In 2016, the president carried the WOW counties by yawning margins. Washington was decided by 40 points, Waukesha by 27. Ozaukee was the tightest of the three: 19 points, prompting whispers of a slow political realignment due north of Milwaukee.\\n\\nWhile it’s true that Ozaukee is as Republican as any county in America—no Democratic presidential hopeful has cracked 40 percent of the vote in more than half a century—it’s also true that Trump has some unique problems here. The president won 56 percent of the vote in Ozaukee County but ran nearly 10 points behind GOP Senator Ron Johnson on the same ticket. It was a vivid display of the misgivings many Republicans had about Trump. Some split their ticket. Others voted for the Libertarian nominee. More than a few simply left the top of the ballot blank.\\n\\nThere is an opportunity here for Biden to break that 40 percent threshold, to take advantage of soft Republican support for the president. The bigger opportunity, however, belongs to Trump.\\n\\nThe 2020 election is shaping up as a clash of tribes—the ultimate binary choice on everything from politics to lifestyle to shared identity. With the electorate even more polarized now than it was in 2016, it’s difficult to imagine 7.2 percent of Ozaukee voters siding with a third-party candidate, as they did last time. If I’ve heard one thing from Americans over the past four years, in conversations from coast to coast, it’s that they feel forced to pick a team. Trump’s most essential task is to remind Republicans—especially in Wisconsin, without whose 10 electoral votes the president will struggle to win reelection—which side they’re really on.\\n\\nThis urgency for Trump echoes far beyond Ozaukee County. Although the suburbs in other swing states are more diverse—the communities around Detroit and Philadelphia bear little resemblance to those around Milwaukee—there are pockets of voters everywhere like those in Ozaukee. Identifying these people and persuading them to remain true to their Republican roots is Trump’s only chance to hold down his margins of defeat in metropolitan areas—which, in turn, may be his only chance of securing a second term.\\n\\nYou’ll know whether he’s successful by watching a place like Cedarburg. It voted in 2016 as a perfect representation of Ozaukee: 88 percent turnout (87 in the county), 55 percent for Trump (56 in the county), 37 percent for Clinton (37 in the county). Four years later, on a September afternoon in downtown, I talked with residents about the changes they see locally—the proliferation of partisan yard signs, the generational shift in attitudes toward racial justice, the one issue they prioritize above all others—and whether Cedarburg could symbolize Trump’s last stand.\\n\\n“Unfortunately, we only have two real parties in this country, so our options are pretty limited,” said QUIANA VERBETEN, a 31-year-old mother of three. “I voted for Trump last time, but I cried. Literally—I cried while voting. I did not want to vote for him. But I decided I had to. And I actually feel better about him now.”\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\n“Honestly, I’m pretty close to a one-issue voter. Abortion is the thing I care about most,” she said. “Trump is the only president to ever speak at the March for Life. That meant a lot to me.”\\n\\nPETER VERBETEN, who works in software, let out a chuckle. “It’s funny, we actually disagree. I feel much worse about him now,” he mused. “But I’ll probably vote for him again, and for the same reason. The abortion issue, the conservative judges he’ll put in place—those things are going to last much longer than his presidency. I’m voting for those things. I’m not voting for Donald Trump.”\\n\\nQuiana and Peter Verbeten shop in downtown Cedarburg. | Tim Alberta/POLITICO\\n\\nQuiana, who trained as a hair stylist but now stays home with the couple’s daughters, said she and her husband are outliers among their peer group. “I’m of the belief that America’s values have been ground down for a long time, that our public schools have pushed an agenda on our kids, and that indoctrination has worked. We’re seeing that now,” she said. “Our generation has grown up with these values that have pushed them further to the left. They’ve got a different foundation from previous generations. That’s why we’re homeschooling our kids.”\\n\\nLike nearly every person I met in Cedarburg, she spoke of a city 60 miles south: Kenosha. After the police shooting of Jacob Blake, an unarmed Black man, a mix of demonstrations—many peaceful, some violent—engulfed the city’s streets, bringing the summer of social unrest that much closer to home for the suburbanites of the WOW counties.\\n\\n“It’s difficult to make sense of what’s happening right now,” Quiana said. “I’m pro-life, and I really do think that every life matters, so I want to support these causes. But I can’t support the organization Black Lives Matter because the organization itself is hateful. I’m all for peaceful protesting. And there needs to be real police reform. I’m just in that gray area. We want to support the police, but we also want to support people who are oppressed.”\\n\\nJEFF MOSES wanted to talk it out.\\n\\n“Look, I disagree with Trump on a lot of things. I’m for immigration. I’m for a lot of these social justice causes. I break with Trump on some pretty fundamental issues. But, on the other hand, I disagree with Democrats on a fundamental issue: abortion. And it’s hard for me to get over that. How can you advocate for social justice but approve of killing unborn babies? It makes no sense to me. So, what am I supposed to do?”\\n\\nHe thought for a long moment. “I don’t know. I’m really not sure if I can vote for Trump again. But I definitely don’t think I can vote for Biden.”\\n\\nMoses, a 57-year-old investment analyst, was waiting outside the bank for his wife to complete a deposit. They live a short walk from downtown. Daisy, the family’s chocolate lab, moaned impatiently throughout our conversation. I asked Moses for his opinion on the Democratic Party. Under the watchful eye of his wife, LINDA MOSES, who had just emerged from the bank, Jeff measured his words.\\n\\nJeff and Linda Moses walk their dog, Daisy, in downtown Cedarburg. | Tim Alberta/POLITICO\\n\\n“I am very, very concerned about what we’re seeing from the far left. And look, trust me, I know there are radicals on the right, too. But the media is so biased; they spend all their time on the right-wing radicals and give the left-wing radicals a pass. And honestly, that’s part of the reason I’ll probably wind up voting for Trump again. The media hates the people who voted for him last time, and they don’t bother understanding how they could possibly vote for him again.”\\n\\nLinda frowned. “I have a slightly different view,” she said.\\n\\n“This isn’t about the far left, or the radical right. This is about Donald Trump,” she continued. “I don’t trust him at all. People like that he’s not politically correct. Well, OK. But that doesn’t mean he’s trustworthy. I think he has no personal ethics whatsoever. None.”\\n\\nLinda explained that she is a longtime Republican who, in 2016, voted for Hillary Clinton for president—and Ron Johnson for Senate. She plans to do the same thing this fall, splitting her ticket between Biden and congressional Republicans. She’s not excited about it. But she feels it’s her duty. “Biden is the lesser of two evils, just like Hillary was,” Linda said.\\n\\nDoes she still have a home in the Republican Party? “I don’t know. I’ve moved left a little bit,” she said. “But I’m not exactly a Democrat. I mean, I have strong feelings about certain things, like the environment and social justice. But, you know, we raised our kids Catholic, we instilled in them certain values. And I don’t believe Democrats represent some of those values, particularly when it comes to life. The abortion issue is a big problem for me.”\\n\\nI asked them both whether Biden could break through in Ozaukee County this November, putting the area in play or at least substantially closing the historic gap between parties.\\n\\n“There’s a big change occurring here. People want to get out of places like Chicagoland and Milwaukee and come up this way for the better schools, the safe communities, and really, with Covid, more space to work from home,” Jeff said.\\n\\nA woman’s clothing store in downtown Cedarburg is adorned with Black Lives Matter signs. | Tim Alberta/POLITICO\\n\\n“Yes, and there’s a much bigger movement against Trump now,” she said. “There’s much more diversity, at least diversity of thought, in this community and in the surrounding areas. And I know some people would disagree, but my personal feeling is that the Black Lives Matter movement helps Biden’s cause here. It really highlights how people are afraid of this white supremacist movement gaining stream—and how Trump seems to be a part of it.”\\n\\nJeff grimaced. “The white supremacist people are nuts, no doubt about it, they’re causing violence and they need to be put away,” he said. “But when you look at these riots in Kenosha—burning down blocks of small businesses, that’s not peaceful protest. I’m telling you, it’s changing peoples’ minds about how they view the racial justice movement. We don’t want chaos and destruction. That’s not peaceful protest. That’s not what Dr. King was about. And when you see it happen in Kenosha, it scares you.”\\n\\nIn the picture-book atmosphere of downtown Cedarburg, only one thing appeared out of place: DAVE BREIDENBACH.\\n\\nThe 68-year-old retired salesman stood in front of a local storefront holding a sign: “Pray to End Abortion.” His silver Ford SUV, parked a few feet away, was plastered with similar pro-life signage. Against the placid backdrop of his hometown, Breidenbach stood out—not just for his scruffy white beard and red MAGA cap, but for his willingness to stir the pot politically. I had noticed, since arriving in Cedarburg, the remarkable reluctance of locals to speak on the record. Never in the past year had I encountered so many people unwilling to put their names to statements. I chalked this up to a general tendency I’ve noticed throughout my career, that wealthy white people are the most averse when it comes to discussing their politics.\\n\\nBreidenbach, who stood courting conversation (and sometimes, he admitted, confrontation) on the corner of Washington Avenue and Turner Street, offered a more urgent explanation.\\n\\n“These people are timid.

Barrett will begin meeting with senators on Tuesday, although some Dems, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, are refusing to meet with her in protest of her election-year nomination.\\n\\nAnd White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told CBS’ “Face The Nation” that \"if all goes well\", the Senate will fill the vacancy before the November election. That would make it an unprecedented confirmation, as no SCOTUS nominee has ever been confirmed that close to a presidential election.\\n\\nHere’s the SCOTUS Judiciary hearing schedule, per Burgess:\\n\\n—Monday, 10/12: Opening statements\\n\\n—Tuesday, 10/13: First round of questions\\n\\n—Wednesday, 10/14: Second round of questions and closed session\\n\\n—Thursday, 10/15: Outside witnesses\\n\\n—Thursday, 10/22: Report the nominee out of committee\\n\\nSO, what are the chances that Barrett makes it over the finish line? Pretty high, according to congressional Republicans. She has rock solid support on the right, especially among conservatives and anti-abortion activists. And she’s battle-tested, having already been through the Senate’s confirmation process for her current judgeship.\\n\\nOf course, Dems will try to land some blows during her high-profile confirmation hearing. And the Senate GOP is working with a slim 53-seat majority. But barring some kind of bombshell or unforeseen roadblock, the feeling among Senate Republicans is that Barrett’s confirmation is all but certain. More on this from Burgess: https://politi.co/337BYLn .\\n\\nIn fact … “President Trump and Senate Majority Leader McConnell are so confident they\\'ll confirm Barrett that they\\'re already thinking about who to tap to replace her on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, based in Chicago,” reports Axios’ Alayna Treene .\\n\\nRelated reads: “Supreme Court Fight Returns Lindsey Graham to Spotlight,” by WSJ’s Siobhan Hughes: https://on.wsj.com/343kyPl ; and “Democrats say Republicans will pay price at polls for confirming Barrett before election,” via Nolan McCaskill: https://politi.co/369RnN6 .\\n\\nAmy Coney Barrett, a federal appellate judge expeted to be the next Supreme Court nominee, is pictured speaking in 2018. | Robert Franklin/South Bend Tribune via AP\\n\\nA message from McDonald\\'s: Ron started as a crew member at McDonald’s in Oakland, CA where he found an exciting path.

Learn how Ron and others succeed at McDonald’s.\\n\\nDEMS STAY DISCIPLINED -- In reacting to Trump\\'s SCOTUS pick, Dems made clear what their messaging strategy is going to be: make it all about health care. In tweets, statements and Sunday news show appearances, Democrats across the board warned Americans that their health care and the popular protections for pre-existing conditions are at stake if Barrett is confirmed, pointing to the Obamacare lawsuit that will come before the Supreme Court in mid-November.\\n\\nSchumer even sent a letter to his Democratic colleagues urging them to stay focused on health care and the potential demise of the Affordable Care Act. “All the data show that with COVID raging, the number one priority for the American people is health care — its affordability, accessibility and quality,” Schumer wrote in the Dear Colleague note. “We must focus like a laser on health care because Judge Barrett’s record is so clear on this issue.” The deets from Burgess: https://politi.co/30bTEUj .\\n\\nTrump, meanwhile, is also apparently making it about health care. “Obamacare will be replaced with a MUCH better, and FAR cheaper, alternative if it is terminated in the Supreme Court. Would be a big WIN for the USA!” Trump tweeted, which only handed fresh ammo to Democrats.\\n\\nRelated reads: “Democrats Aim for Court Fight Focused on Policy, Not Personality,” from Bloomberg’s Jennifer Epstein and Laura Davison: https://bloom.bg/2S5nQfd ; and “Democrats Don’t Want to Get Personal in Debate Over Barrett,” via NYT’s Shane Goldmacher and Katie Glueck: https://nyti.ms/3mQqnIi .\\n\\nMUCK IT UP -- As we’ve said before, Senate Democrats can’t derail Trump’s nominee if Mitch McConnell has the votes. And they can’t even slow it down much, either. Here’s what Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday: “We could slow it down perhaps a matter of hours, maybe days at the most, but we can’t stop the outcome,” he said. “What we should do is to address this now respectfully.”\\n\\nBut Democrats *can* make life a little more miserable for Republicans — especially the vulnerable GOP lawmakers who are up for reelection and are itching to hit the campaign trail.

Welcome to Huddle, the play-by-play guide to all things Capitol Hill, on this September 28, where your host knows there’s no use crying over spilled milk — but can we make an exception for an entire tank of spilled wine? !\\n\\nMONDAY’S MOST CLICKED: IB Times’ story on Sen. Lindsey Graham pleading for campaign cash on Fox News drew the most clicks.\\n\\nTHE 2020 PLOT TWIST YOU DIDN’T KNOW YOU NEEDED -- How can 2020 get any crazier, you ask? Well, a deadlocked Electoral College could force the House to step in and determine the fate of the presidency — a once-in-a-century phenomenon that has only happened a few times in history. And both Trump and Speaker Nancy Pelosi have begun to seriously consider the possibility of the election fight coming to Congress. Pelosi has privately raised the idea to her leadership team and even sent out a “Dear Colleague” letter yesterday emphasizing how important it is for Democrats to win House state delegations.\\n\\nBres, Kyle and Heather explain more: “Under that scenario, which hasn’t happened since 1876, every state’s delegation gets a single vote. Who receives that vote is determined by an internal tally of each lawmaker in the delegation. This means the presidency may not be decided by the party that controls the House itself but by the one that controls more state delegations in the chamber. And right now, Republicans control 26 delegations to Democrats’ 22, with Pennsylvania tied and Michigan a 7-6 plurality for Democrats, with a 14th seat held by independent Justin Amash.\\n\\n“A battle inside the House could be brutal, even more politically bare-knuckled than Trump and Senate Republicans pushing through a Supreme Court nominee days before the election. In some states, a single seat could decide the partisan makeup of a delegation. There could be extended legal challenges over declaring victors in House races, as national party leaders and their legal teams dive headlong into the results for individual races at the county or even precinct level.” The story: https://politi.co/3mSRQJD .\\n\\nIn other House congressional race news: “In Colorado, Fiery Political Novice Aims for a Seat in the House,” by NYT’s Carl Hulse: https://nyti.ms/3mWFQqk .\\n\\nSIGNS OF LIFE? -- Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke by phone Friday about a potential coronavirus relief deal, per Pelosi’s aide Drew Hammill. And Pelosi told CNN’s Jake Tapper that she still believes “we can come to an agreement” and “I\\'m hoping for a deal.” She also acknowledged that House Dems may offer up their own bill on the floor this week, but said she would “rather have a deal which puts money in people’s pockets than to have a rhetorical argument.”\\n\\nBut Pelosi also emphasized that Dems have already come down significantly on their offer — their latest package is expected to cost around $2.4 trillion — and made clear she’s not interested in coming down any further. “But if they do not want to go to that place, if they’re not going to meet the needs of the American people, if they’re not ready to do what is necessary to crush the virus, to honor our heroes, our health care workers, our teachers, our transportation, sanitation, first responders, police and fire, if they don’t want to recognize that these people are risking their lives to save lives, and now they will lose their jobs, to the tune of millions of people … and then go on unemployment insurance, is that smart? I don\\'t think so.”\\n\\nNotable … The House floor schedule this week includes the “Possible Consideration of Legislation Related to the Coronavirus Pandemic.”\\n\\nRelated read: “Centrist Democrats got their COVID bill, now they want a vote,” by The Hill’s Mike Lillis and Scott Wong: https://bit.ly/30eQxuS .\\n\\nRETURN OF THE TAX RETURNS -- The New York Times dropped a bombshell yesterday, unveiling two decades worth of Trump’s tax returns and promising to publish a series of stories over the next few weeks. The big takeaway from the first piece — titled “Long-Concealed Records Show Trump\\'s Chronic Losses and Years of Income Tax Avoidance” — is that Trump only paid $750 in federal income taxes in 2016, and zero dollars in 10 of the 15 years prior.\\n\\nHouse Democrats, of course, have been trying to get their hands on Trump’s tax returns for a while, but the lawsuit is tied up in court. Here’s the statement from House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal: “Now, Donald Trump is the boss of the agency he considers an adversary. It is essential that the IRS’s presidential audit program remain free of interference. Today’s report underscores the importance of the Ways and Means Committee’s ongoing lawsuit to access Mr. Trump’s tax returns and ensure the presidential audit program is functioning effectively, without improper influence.”\\n\\nFINALLY, SOME GOOD NEWS -- “Back from brink of death, Mark DeSaulnier is ready to work and run again,” via Tal Kopan of the San Francisco Chronicle: https://bit.ly/2GgxngZ .\\n\\nI MADE IT NICE -- In another sign that the Senate GOP majority is in jeopardy this November, the historically right-leaning Chamber of Commerce is now planning to make nice with Senate Dems. The dispatch from Alex Isenstadt: “Jack Howard, the Chamber’s senior vice president of congressional and public affairs, announced during a Friday morning staff video conference that the organization would be engaging in an ‘all-hands-on-deck … serious, sustained’ effort to ‘normalize our relationships’ with Senate Democrats, according to a clip of the meeting obtained by POLITICO.\\n\\n“The remarks come with Democrats leading Republican senators in the polls in several key states — and with the pro-business, traditionally conservative Chamber facing a precarious moment. The group has clashed with President Donald Trump on issues including trade and immigration and is now facing an internal revolt over its decision to endorse a slate of vulnerable freshmen House Democrats for reelection. The move represented a major shift for the Chamber, which has long endorsed and funded Republican candidates and backed few Democrats in recent years.” More: https://politi.co/3mULFVg .\\n\\nAD WARS: “\\'Save Texas\\': Dan Crenshaw stars in Avengers-style campaign ad,” from the Washington Examiner’s Madison Dibble: https://washex.am/36frYSm .\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTRANSITIONS\\n\\nCaroline Brennan is now scheduler for Rep.

Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) tested positive for the coronavirus, our Congress team reports. The announcement came as President Donald Trump, who tested positive for Covid-19 last Friday, was spending the weekend at Walter Reed Medical Center just north of Washington.\\n\\nBut Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the change of plans won’t stop the Senate from moving forward with Amy Coney Barrett\\'s Supreme Court nomination. The Senate Judiciary Committee is still set to begin confirmation hearings on Oct. 12.\\n\\nThe delay will interrupt the Senate’s other business. Last week, the Senate Homeland Security Committee advanced Chad Wolf’s nomination to lead the Department of Homeland Security permanently, meaning he now awaits a full Senate vote. And since McConnell had filed cloture on a handful of judicial nominees before the Senate pushed back its schedule, it’s even more unclear when Wolf will be up next.\\n\\nAnd the outbreak “has added another layer of chaos to already tumultuous negotiations over renewing aid for airline workers,” our Stephanie Beasley reports, throwing into doubt whether any relief could be passed soon. On Friday, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi promised that airline aid will be enacted one way or another, whether as part of a larger package or as a standalone bill.\\n\\nHouse members are on call to head back to D.C. as soon as a deal is reached, but even if an aid bill passes the House, the Senate\\'s planned recess raises questions about its fate. A spokesperson for McConnell declined to comment on whether Senate members would consider voting on airline aid prior to Oct. 19.\\n\\nComplicating matters, three more Republican senators have said they are quarantining, narrowing the GOP’s 53-member majority.

The second found that federal labor law “neither requires nor prohibits midterm bargaining” and “makes zipper clauses, which limit negotiations during the term of a union contract, mandatory subjects of bargaining,” according to Wagner.\\n\\nThe last decision, he writes, “states that when an expiring union contract is renewed indefinitely while parties negotiate on a new contract, that is effectively a new agreement that is subject to agency head review and implementation of new governmentwide rules and regulations.”\\n\\nMORE: “Judge declines to stop rule requiring Michigan state employees to OK union dues annually,” from The Detroit News\\n\\nEconomy\\n\\nICYMI — SEPTEMBER JOBS REPORT: The unemployment rate dropped last month by half a percentage point to 7.9 percent.\\n\\nSome 661,000 jobs were added last month.

This time around, approximately 1.5 million jobs had been lost since the pandemic hit, as of June,” Kellie writes.\\n\\nCUTS AHEAD: Democrats, governors and labor groups have been calling for more aid for state budgets decimated by steep revenue drop-offs because of the pandemic. “Otherwise, they warn, more cuts are coming to essential services like education, health care and public safety that local economies need now more than ever,” Kellie adds.\\n\\nRep.

At the top of the agenda, unsurprisingly, would be another coronavirus relief package. “A stimulus package prior to the November election is highly unlikely, and barring a major winter resurgence of the virus coupled with a spike in business closures and unemployment, a lame duck stimulus bill is also an uphill climb,” the firm writes in one memo. Exactly what Biden proposes “will depend on the public health and economic outlook,” the firm continues. “If unemployment rates continue to fall and infection rates do not worsen during the winter, a smaller, more targeted package is likely.”\\n\\n— The memo also lays out what Biden might do on health care, taxes, education, financial services, the minimum wage, trade, energy and the environment, among other policy areas. A second memo outlines what Biden might do on taxes if Democrats retake the Senate. And a third memo — which the firm admits is “highly speculative” — offers guidance on what many lobbyists’ clients really want to know: who Biden is likely to tap to staff his White House and fill his cabinet if he wins.\\n\\n— Here are some of the names the firm mentions: Ron Klain or Steve Ricchetti for White House chief of staff; Jake Sullivan, Tony Blinken or Robert Malley for national security adviser; Jared Bernstein, Heather Boushey or Jason Furman as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; and Lael Brainard, Sarah Bloom Raskin or Larry Summers as chairman of the National Economic Council.

Blackstone hired PricewaterhouseCoopers over the summer to lobby on the taxation of real estate investment trusts and also retains half a dozen other outside lobbying firms, according to disclosure filings.\\n\\nTWITTER RESHUFFLES WASHINGTON OFFICE: “Twitter's public policy director, Carlos Monje, has left the social media company's Washington office to join the transition team for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, a person familiar with the move said Thursday, POLITICO’s Steven Overly reports. The company has also beefed up its Washington office with several new hires and promoted Lauren Culbertson, who’s been with Twitter since 2017, “to the head of U.S. public policy. Culbertson started her own consulting business prior to joining Twitter and previously served as deputy communications director for former Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.).”\\n\\n— Joining her are Amy Murphy, a former Internet Association lobbyist, who “will focus on privacy and internet liability law”; Todd O’Boyle, who left Lime “to handle Twitter’s policies related to elections, the census, violent extremism and immigration”; and Wifredo Fernandez, who “will help manage federal and state advocacy after working as a legal fellow at the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative.”\\n\\nANNALS OF CONGRESSIONAL SIDE GIGS: Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) “has broken with the scientific mainstream during the coronavirus pandemic — decrying stay-at-home orders and warning of a ‘cult of masks.’” Now Harris, who’s also a medical doctor, “has joined the hunt for coronavirus treatments with an unpaid side gig overseeing a drug company trial,” POLITICO’s Zachary Brennan reports. “Harris is one of three members of the data and safety monitoring board for the trial run by NeuroRx, a small Delaware company whose CEO and founder has longstanding ties to the congressman.”\\n\\n— “The members of the board are responsible for monitoring safety and efficacy data from the ongoing trial, which started in May, and have the power to end the study if problems arise. The drug in question, aviptadil, was created in 1970 to treat lung inflammation, but never reached the market. NeuroRx is now investigating whether it can help Covid-19 patients with acute lung failure. Harris’s role is an unusual one: Former [Food and Drug Administration] Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told POLITICO that he’d never heard of a sitting member of Congress serving on a data monitoring committee for any drug.”\\n\\n— “The arrangement doesn’t appear to run afoul of House ethics rules because Harris is not being paid by NeuroRx and does not own a stake in the company. But several bioethicists questioned his lack of experience in evaluating data from drug trials, and said that his close ties to NeuroRx CEO Jonathan Javitt could complicate matters if problems arose with the company’s study.”\\n\\nGRAHAM RAISED MONEY FROM PODESTA GROUP BEFORE BASHING IT: Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has been running TV ads for the past month “criticizing his Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison for working for the Podesta Group,” the Washington lobbying firm that collapsed in 2017. But Graham hasn’t always been opposed to the firm, The Post and Courier’s Jamie Lovegrove reports. “During Graham’s last reelection campaign, the South Carolina Republican held a fundraiser with more than a dozen Podesta Group lobbyists at a Capitol Hill townhouse owned by the firm’s co-founder, Tony Podesta, according to an invitation obtained by The Post and Courier.”\\n\\n— “Attendance at the April 11, 2013, breakfast fundraiser cost $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for political action committees, according to the invitation.

But taxpayer advocates say the cases underscore the need for more transparency and that the amount of data released by the government is unacceptable — even as Congress considers whether to make it easier for PPP loans of less than $150,000 to be forgiven and to throw more money at the program.\\n\\nThe SBA inspector general\\'s office says it has “initiated hundreds of cases involving potential fraud\" in the two programs, Kellie reports. The alleged fraudsters stand accused of using money meant for payroll instead to “finance such extravagances as luxury cars, Vegas gambling trips and nights on the town at strip clubs.”\\n\\nRELATED: “JPMorgan Probing Employees’ Role in Misuse of Relief Funds,” from Bloomberg\\n\\nCOVID-19 IN THE FIELDS: The nation’s 2.5 million farmworkers — about half of whom the government estimates are undocumented — are critical to keeping the food system working, but have gotten little federal help to protect themselves from the coronavirus, our Helena Bottemiller Evich, Ximena Bustillo and Liz Crampton report.\\n\\nOrchard worker Francisco Hernandez reaches to pull honey crisp apples off the vine during a thinning of the trees at an orchard in Yakima, Wash. on June 16, 2020. | AP Photo/Elaine Thompson\\n\\n“For several weeks,” they write, “many of the places that grow the nation’s fruits and vegetables have seen disproportionately high rates of coronavirus cases — a national trend that, as harvest season advances in many states, threatens already vulnerable farmworkers, their communities and the places they work.”\\n\\nHealth departments are not collecting data on how many individual farmworkers have tested positive or been hospitalized or killed by the coronavirus. “The Food and Environment Reporting Network estimates that at least 57,000 food system workers, including 6,700 farmworkers, have tested positive for Covid-19 nationally, but that’s just a partial snapshot because testing is limited,” Helena, Ximena and Liz write.\\n\\nAT THE FEDERAL LEVEL… The Trump administration has repeatedly declined to impose mandatory safety requirements for any workplace. And the federal government has not designated any pandemic aid to help farmers obtain personal protective gear for their laborers, unlike other essential workers like nurses and police officers.\\n\\n“Trump’s silence on the immigration status of farmworkers, critics say, is one of political convenience as farmers, a rock-solid part of the president’s base, freely admit there’s simply no way to harvest the country’s crops without help from foreign workers, whether they live in the U.S. without legal status or come in for several months on a work visa.”\\n\\nOn the Hill\\n\\nSENATE SKINNY BILL UPDATE: Senate Republicans introduced S. 178 Tuesday in an effort to prod Democrats forward on another round of pandemic aid, following weeks of disagreement over how much Congress should bolster the pandemic-battered economy, our Marianne LeVine and John Bresnahan report.\\n\\nThe GOP hasn’t tallied whether it has enough votes to pass the bill, but is tentatively planning to vote on the measure Thursday, they write.\\n\\nWHAT’S IN IT: “The new, more narrow GOP proposal will provide $300 in increased weekly federal unemployment benefits through Dec. 27, additional money for the Paycheck Protection Program and liability protections for schools and businesses as they try to reopen,” the pair report.

And though Trump has campaigned on his ability to reignite the U.S. economy, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that nearly 60 percent of people think the economy is on the wrong track.\\n\\nMORE: “In Battleground Pennsylvania, Blue- and White-Collar Voters Move Farther Apart,” from The Wall Street Journal\\n\\nIn the Workplace\\n\\nAUDIT FINDS DC METRO CREATES HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT: A recent audit into the District of Columbia’s subway operations center found the workplace created a “toxic” environment where employees “are bullied, racially and sexually harassed, and told by managers to ignore authorities and operating procedures,” Justin George reports for The Washington Post.\\n\\nThe 50-page report points out “deep cultural, communication and organizational flaws in the agency’s Rail Operations Control Center,” raising questions about Metrorail safety for both employees and passengers.\\n\\nWHAT NOW? “Metro has 45 days to begin addressing more than 20 safety and structural findings identified by the commission, an independent panel created by Congress to oversee Metro safety after the previous oversight panel was found to be ineffective,” George writes.\\n\\nRegulatory Corner\\n\\nDOL TO WEIGH IN ON GIG WORKER DEBATE: The White House budget office is reviewing a DOL proposed rule that would clarify whether a worker should be classified as an employee or an independent contractor. OMB began review of the regulation on Aug. 28, the first step before the proposal is published publicly.\\n\\nThe question could have huge ramifications for the gig economy, as workers for apps like Uber, Lyft and Doordash are generally classified as independent contractors who aren’t protected under federal minimum wage and overtime laws. A source briefed directly on the situation confirmed to Morning Shift that DOL leadership wouldn’t have included it on the regulatory agenda if it didn’t think it could finalize the rule this year.\\n\\nBUT… Such a rule could be threatened next Congress if Democrats were to win the White House and take control of Congress in the fall. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can use a fast-track procedure to overturn a regulation issued within the prior 60 legislative days via simple majority votes.\\n\\nFEDERAL COURT VOIDS PARTS OF DOL JOINT EMPLOYER RULE: A federal court on Tuesday invalidated several parts of the Trump administration’s joint employer rule. Southern District of New York federal judge Gregory Woods found the rule was “arbitrary and capricious” and that the DOL’s interpretation of who counts as a joint employer conflicted with the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act.\\n\\nThe rule, issued in January, set up a more stringent legal test that made it harder for businesses to be on the hook as a “joint employer” when their franchisees or contractors violate federal wage and overtime laws. The rulemaking marked a reversal from the Obama administration, which said a business with indirect control over employees could be held jointly liable, a looser standard that made it easier to classify companies as joint employers.\\n\\nSpecifically, the opinion vacates the Trump administration test for what is known as “vertical” joint employer liability. Vertical joint employment is more common, and occurs when an individual is employed by a contractor or staffing agency, but relies on the work provided by another business who has contracted them.

Although she signed on to a controversial opinion upholding the Florida Legislature’s insistence that would-be voters with felony records pay fines as a prerequisite to voting, her brief record on the federal bench left her views on hot-button issues pretty opaque. In that posture, Lagoa would not have served as a severe splitter, a divider or a source of deep existential agony for millions of Americans.\\n\\nBarrett, like Justice Brett Kavanaugh before her, may well be a delightful person. And while her professed devotion to a theory of interpretation called “originalism” puts her solidly in the camp of conservative jurists, Lagoa is of that ilk, too. The difference is that Barrett’s views on contentious issues like abortion, Obamacare, gun rights, sexual assault and immigration are well-documented and lean decidedly against majorities of the voting public. Her nomination is thus a political act of splitting. It is yet one more Trumpian assault on “We the People” of a democratic republic composed of many different views, beliefs and needs. And sadly, in the wake of Justice Ginsburg’s legacy of moderation and grace, pushing Barrett through a Republican-only Senate vote just days before an election that will determine the fate of American democracy is more fuel for the fires of hatred, extreme fear and violence. It does not bode well. She is the wrong choice for America right now.\\n\\n‘Once again, the court will be a conservative bulwark against democratic forces’\\n\\nHoward Gillman is chancellor of the University of California, Irvine, and the co-author of The Religion Clauses: The Case for Separating Church and State .\\n\\nFor most of the nation’s history, the Supreme Court was a protector of the rights and interests of America’s elites against larger democratic forces. Its focus was the protection of property rights, corporate rights, slave owner rights and limits on the ability of legislatures to regulate. It struck down income taxes, child labor laws, minimum wage laws and civil rights legislation. It did very little to protect the rights and interests of those struggling for greater equality and opportunity. It prevented democratic majorities from advancing progressive agendas. It tried mightily to prevent the New Deal. In short, it was a conservative bulwark.\\n\\nThis legacy started to change in the 1950s and 1960s as a result of a bipartisan agreement among presidents and senators that courts should be more supportive of civil rights, civil liberties, the circumstances of “discrete and insular minorities,” and the ability of government to address contemporary social challenges. Many of us who grew up during this period took for granted that the Supreme Court would be a force for protecting the vulnerable rather than the powerful. But no longer.\\n\\nWith the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett — an undoubtedly qualified jurist with rock-solid conservative credentials — the court will revert to the role it performed for most of our history, with an ironclad majority of conservative justices who have dedicated their careers to taking back the courts. As a result, Congress’ authority to address national challenges, including access to health care and the promotion of civil rights, will be diminished, regulatory agencies will work less in the interests of average people, voting rights will receive less protection, state and local governments will be allowed to align themselves more with majority religious sects, the interests of powerful religious groups will be privileged over hard-won protections for the LGBTQ-plus community, and women’s reproductive rights will be at the mercy of state legislatures. Joining her in the new majority are other justices who were appointed by Republican presidents who did not win a majority of the popular vote, at a time when Democratic president candidates have won a majority or plurality of the popular vote in seven of the past eight elections. In short, once again, the court will be a conservative bulwark against democratic forces.\\n\\n‘She will likely move the Supreme Court in a principled direction’\\n\\nIlya Shapiro is director of the Robert A. Levy Center for Constitutional Rights at the Cato Institute and author of Supreme Disorder: Judicial Nominations and the Politics of America’s Highest Court .\\n\\nJudge Amy Coney Barrett has displayed a seriousness of purpose and is dedicated to finding and applying the Constitution’s original public meaning. Her thoughtful opinions and academic writings show a willingness to hold government officials’ feet to the constitutional fire, although one law review article gives me pause about potential over-deference to state authority regarding the sorts of regulations and restrictions that have come to the fore during the Covid-19 pandemic. I have no doubt she is qualified to be a justice and that she will bring esteem to the Supreme Court.\\n\\nAs Justice Barrett, she will likely move the Supreme Court in a principled direction, as there would no longer be a need to account for Chief Justice John Roberts’ strategery to achieve a majority. I look forward to the court’s finally starting to flesh out the scope of the right to keep and bear arms, to putting an end to treating people differently based on the color of their skin and to reining in the federal government’s overreach in a host of areas. While Barrett isn’t known for her administrative law opinions, I would hope also that she will join fellow Trump nominees Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh in reining in the bureaucracy, forcing Congress to make the tough decisions about conflicting policy views. That’s ultimately the only way we’ll start dissipating the toxic cloud surrounding judicial nominations.\\n\\nKavanaugh is now the swing justice when it comes to abortion\\n\\nMary Ziegler is a professor at Florida State University College of Law and author, most recently of Abortion and the Law in America: Roe v. Wade to the Present .\\n\\nAmy Coney Barrett seems likely to shape the court’s jurisprudence for decades to come — not least when it comes to abortion. The court already had a conservative majority, but Chief Justice John Roberts’ concern for the court’s appearance seemingly made him reluctant to dismantle abortion rights too quickly. Barrett’s ascent likely gives the deciding vote on abortion to Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a judge whose name still almost immediately brings to mind the #MeToo movement. Kavanaugh, like Roberts, is not likely to give conservatives instant gratification when it comes to abortion. But his professed respect for precedent has not so far stopped him from rolling back abortion rights. He seemed to think that abortion foes could distinguish identical Louisiana and Texas laws, all while claiming to respect precedent. Kavanaugh understands that the court’s undue-burden test provides a perfect vehicle for undermining abortion rights. There is no reason to expect that will change if Barrett becomes the high court’s sixth conservative member.\\n\\nBarrett may also help to form part of a more clearly — and unapologetically — conservative wing. Justice Clarence Thomas is fond of fiery dissents and concurrences, but he often finds no one to join him. Barrett firms up the court’s conservative majority — creating a sort of insurance policy for the right if the chief justice or one of his colleagues breaks away from the pack. And Barrett’s confirmation might make more of the justices comfortable joining Thomas in demanding radical changes to many areas of the law.\\n\\nA foolproof conservative majority, with Barrett at its heart, might come at a real cost to the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. If, as widely expected, Joe Biden wins the popular vote, Democrats will have carried a public majority in seven of the past eight presidential elections. In the same period, the court has become ever more conservative, and likely to contravene policies that voters prefer. Roberts has long had a fear of backlash — the kind of political crisis that can plague the court when it departs too far from public opinion. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Donald Trump might not care about what becomes of the court as an institution, but members of the court’s new conservative supermajority would be wise to recognize that the chief justice has reason to be concerned about the court’s reputation. When it comes to abortion, or to the fate of Obamacare, everyone is watching. The fate of the judicial branch’s legitimacy might just hang in the balance.\\n\\n‘We may be looking at the last new Roberts Court’\\n\\nJosh Blackman is a professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston, an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute and the co-author of An Introduction to Constitutional Law: 100 Supreme Court Cases Everyone Should Know .\\n\\nFor the past 15 years, the Supreme Court has been known as the Roberts Court. But in truth, each new justice forms a new court. Chief Justice Roberts has presided over numerous personnel changes. Justices Sandra Day O’Connor, David Souter, John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg left, and Justices Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh have arrived. By Election Day, the chief justice will likely welcome Justice Amy Coney Barrett as the ninth member of the court. And a new Roberts Court will begin.\\n\\nThe confirmation process for Justice Barrett will be excruciatingly painful. Yet, it will still be familiar — a process that we know, with a predictable outcome. The future of the court, on the other hand, is far more uncertain. In 2021, or perhaps 2025, Democrats will likely push to expand the court. Roberts may soon have to greet two or more new members, even though there were no departures. The chief may go through all the same formalities, welcoming No. 10 and 11 the same way he welcomed No. 9 — but the Supreme Court will never be the same. We may be looking at the last new Roberts Court.\\n\\n‘She has not been and will not be subject to a level of vetting appropriate to a lifetime appointment’\\n\\nJamal Greene is a professor at Columbia Law School and the author of the forthcoming book How Rights Went Wrong: Why Our Obsession with Rights Is Tearing America Apart .\\n\\nJudge Barrett seems to be a smart lawyer and a decent person. But the fact is we can’t intelligently predict what her selection will mean for the court or for the country because she has not been and will not be subject to a level of vetting appropriate to a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. What we do know is that the woman whose seat she is seeking to fill lived a life committed not just to equality — what she often called “equal citizenship stature” for all — but to values of thoughtfulness and due process. To allow just two weeks to prepare for a hearing and vote, on the eve of a presidential election, dishonors her legacy.\\n\\nA role model for women\\n\\nHelen Alvaré is a professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School and the co-author of the forthcoming book Christianity and the Laws of Conscience .\\n\\nAmy Coney Barrett will inspire several generations of female lawyers and academics for many of the same reasons Ruth Bader Ginsburg did. Her intellectual excellence and her dedication throughout decades to the unrelenting and high-stakes work of lawyering, writing, teaching and judging make her a role model for lawyers generally.\\n\\nRealistically, though, female attorneys are still prone to asking themselves again and again whether they can “do justice” to both their work and their personal responsibilities. For these women, Judge Barrett’s example, like Justice Ginsburg’s, will be a touchstone for many years.\\n\\n‘To talk about what Amy Coney Barrett would mean for this issue or that issue is to miss the true historical significance of this appointment’\\n\\nRichard Pildes is a professor at the New York University School of Law.\\n\\nThe authority and legitimacy of public institutions takes decades to build up — but can unravel far more quickly. We have been in the midst of a blood feud over the Supreme Court for some years now, which is increasingly likely to cause great damage to an institution the country needs. Like in all blood feuds, each side has its own story of how it all began, which goes back nearly 40 years: You blocked Bork. You denied Garland a hearing. We had to get rid of the filibuster for lower court judges. We had to get rid of it for the Supreme Court. Overwhelmed by the politics of the moment when in power, neither side can stop, making it inevitable that when the worm turns, the other side will up the ante all the more.\\n\\nTo talk about what Amy Coney Barrett would mean for this issue or that issue is to miss the true historical significance of this appointment and what it will mean for the court. If Democrats capture the Senate and White House this fall, the pressures to pack the court will become more formidable than at any time since Franklin D. Roosevelt’s disastrous 1937 attempt (the political backlash against that effort brought about the end of the New Deal). That effort might press to add four new justices, to create a 13-member court with seven Democratic appointees. As soon as the Republicans regain power, they will then take their turn at refashioning the court to serve their aims.\\n\\nA bespoke court, custom designed and redesigned to serve the interests of the party in power, would lose much of the institutional capital it has built up over two centuries. Perhaps Judge Barrett’s nomination will eventually lead the warring tribes to forge a treaty that reduces the stakes in these appointments (through mechanisms scholars have discussed for years). Or perhaps the stakes in Supreme Court appointments will diminish because one political party gains complete control of government for decades, thus making the court less relevant, as Republicans did after the Civil War and Democrats did during the New Deal. Of course, each side’s firm belief that it is (always) on the cusp of doing that is part of what propels the feud forward.\\n\\nBarrett deserves a fair hearing — from both sides\\n\\nAdam J. White is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.\\n\\nAs a judge and a scholar, Amy Coney Barrett has dedicated her career to thoughtful study of interpreting laws and weighing precedents. She would be an ideal Supreme Court justice in any era, but especially in this era, when proper understandings of legal interpretation and stare decisis are of such central importance to the court’s work. There is every reason to expect that Judge Barrett will be an exemplary justice, and the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearing should be a good moment to introduce her to the broader American public and to consider the proper role of the court and the rule of law in our constitutional government.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/newsletters/huddle/2020/10/02/trumps-covid-diagnosis-renews-testing-debate-on-capitol-hill-490509', 'Full Text': 'Trump’s Covid diagnosis renews testing debate on Capitol Hill Presented by\\n\\nwith a big assist from Sarah Ferris\\n\\nTHE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF GETS COVID -- President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump have tested positive for coronavirus, just 32 days before the election and two days after Trump debated Joe Biden on stage, where the president teased the Democratic presidential nominee for wearing such large masks and taking other precautions to avoid contracting the virus.\\n\\nThe early morning tweet that rocked Washington, and the world: “Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!” This comes after Trump’s top aide, Hope Hicks, started experiencing symptoms and received a positive diagnosis, as Bloomberg’s Jennifer Jacobs first reported Thursday.\\n\\nOkay, so now what? Well, it certainly seems unlikely that there will be more presidential debates or Trump rallies. The president is now effectively sidelined during the critical final stretch of the campaign. And it seems likely that other high-level White House officials — as well as Biden — will now need to get tested for Covid-19.\\n\\nALSO, this is only going to renew a fierce debate on Capitol Hill over testing. Remember, the Capitol still does not have wide-scale testing for people who enter the building, despite pleas from rank-and-file members and even some high-ranking lawmakers such as House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy.\\n\\nA string of lawmakers — who constantly travel back and forth — have already contracted the virus. And not to mention, a number of congressional Republicans have close and pretty regular contact with the president. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell both huddled with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin earlier this week to discuss a coronavirus relief deal (Mnuchin tested negative this morning, as well as Vice President Mike Pence).\\n\\nBut Pelosi and McConnell rejected an offer at the beginning of the pandemic to have rapid testing in the Capitol, saying it would be unfair and bad optics since the American people were struggling to get tests at the time.

But Congress is no closer to knowing whether any relief money will actually go out the door before Election Day.\\n\\nDay six of “Will they, won’t they?”... Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Steven Mnuchin say they’ll try at least one more day to clinch a multi-trillion dollar stimulus deal. But both telegraphed Thursday that enormous gaps remained, including state and local government funding, of course, as well as items like the child tax credit. Pelosi herself sounded pessimistic speaking to her members on Thursday, and the White House was accusing Democrats of making “illegal immigration” requests.\\n\\nMods in mutiny … Frustration is climbing among endangered members in both parties. Among House Democrats, roughly two dozen frontliners personally texted Pelosi urging her to take a deal with the GOP — many eager for something rather than nothing. And 18 of them actually voted against their party’s partisan bill on the floor Thursday, holding out for a bill that can actually become law and anxious about going home without a deal. “This is just a vote to make people feel good,” said Rep. Cindy Axne (D-Iowa). “I want to help people. That means sitting at the table and getting a damn deal.” The latest from Sarah, your Huddle host and Heather: https://politi.co/3cS14kw\\n\\nAcross the Capitol … some of the GOP’s most vulnerable senators are also starting to get antsy about heading into the election empty-handed. Many Republicans up for reelection say it would be a mistake to adjourn this month without taking any action (though they’re careful not to point any fingers at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell). “There’s no reason we shouldn’t all be here until the election if that’s what it takes to pass a follow up to the CARES Act,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said. More from Burgess and Bres: https://politi.co/3ijP0cR .\\n\\nPAYBACK’S A MITCH -- The Senate will officially be here next week, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is already teeing up votes on more judges as a kind of a payback for Democrats’ delay tactics in the SCOTUS fight. But even if Republicans can’t get Amy Coney Barrett across the finish line by Nov. 3, McConnell made clear Thursday night that he would move ahead with the vote during the lame-duck — regardless of the less-than-ideal optics. “There are no reduced constitutional prerogatives during either of our tenures,\" McConnell told Fox News.

Other Democrats have said they’re open to a sit-down, including Sens. Dick Durbin and Cory Booker. Another, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), said he was willing but was still upset that the White House reached out the same day RBG was lying in state, per CNN’s Manu Raju.\\n\\nAnd the intense public vetting has already begun. NBC News’ Heidi Przybyla reported that Coney Barrett had taken part in a 2006 two-page newspaper ad calling for Roe v. Wade to be overturned, describing the law’s legacy as “barbaric.” And LA Times’ Jennifer Haberkorn revealed that one week before RBG died, Barrett participated in a mock court on the Obamacare case going to the Court next month — in which none of the judges sided with the White House in striking the entire law.\\n\\nRelated read: “In Supreme Court Fight, McSally Sees a Chance to Reboot Her Senate Campaign,” via NYT’s Glenn Thrush and Hank Stephenson: https://nyti.ms/3nc16ss .\\n\\nHAPPY FRI-YAY!

Just weeks before the election, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had forced the health care vote through a rarely used procedural move in protest of the GOP’s quick march to confirm the next Supreme Court Justice, as Alice Miranda Ollstein explains: https://politi.co/33kLcE1 .\\n\\nEndangered Republicans were split on the vote though.

The story from Burgess and James Arkin: “In the wild race for a Georgia Senate seat, Joe’s son Matt Lieberman could play spoiler and allow two Republicans to advance to a runoff. Democrats are calling on Matt to drop out in favor of the party’s preferred candidate Rev. Raphael Warnock, but he is unbowed.\\n\\n“About 1,000 miles north, Joe Lieberman has endorsed Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) in a race that Democrats likely need to win to seize the majority.

There’s a feeling in GOP circles that Trump didn’t do himself any favors — in fact, he may have only helped his opponent — by talking over Biden and not even allowing him a chance to slip-up. “Joe Biden usually gets in trouble ... just by talking,” said McCarthy, a top Trump ally. “The more he talks, I think the stronger President Trump’s campaign is.”\\n\\nBut McCarthy’s advice may not even be needed: Even before his coronavirus diagnosis, Trump hinted Thursday that he might not participate in the next debate if there’s a rules or format change, as the commission has vowed to do. “Why would I allow the Debate Commission to change the rules for the second and third Debates when I easily won last time?” Trump tweeted.\\n\\nA FIT BY A KING -- Controversial Rep.

Dawn Addiego (D-Burlington), who switched parties from Republican to Democrat in 2019, voted against a proposal to increase the corporate business tax. Democratic lawmakers late Monday introduced a $32.7 billion, nine-month state budget proposal that increases taxes on millionaires from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent and reinstates a 2.5-percent surcharge on corporations that will be phased-out in a few years. It also boosts the state’s surplus to more than $2.5 billion and calls for $4.5 billion in borrowing to help close a revenue shortfall. The spending plan also restores a number of programs Gov. Phil Murphy did not include in the budget he presented to lawmakers.\\n\\n— Murphy administration agrees to $4.5B in borrowing, by POLITICO’s Katherine Landergan: Gov. Phil Murphy‘s administration said Tuesday it agrees with state lawmakers that New Jersey should borrow up to $4.5 billion to help plug a revenue hole caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The amount of borrowing lawmakers proposed in their $32.7 billion spending plan is more than the $4 billion Murphy originally sought.\\n\\nGET YOUR MAGNIFYING GLASS OUT BECAUSE IT’S MYSTERY SOLVING TIME — “No one taking responsibility for mandatory minimums amendment,” by NJ Advance Media’s Nikita Biryukov: “No one is taking responsibility for a quietly made amendment adding official misconduct to a list of offenses that will have their mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines excised under a bill working its way through the legislature. The bill, originally penned to remove minimum sentencing guidelines for non-violent property and drug crimes, was quietly amended last month to include official misconduct. State Sen. Sandra Cunningham (D-Jersey City), the bill’s prime Senate sponsor on Tuesday told the New Jersey Globe she did not know who added the provision, and she said she was still undecided on whether or not she would support the quietly added measure.”\\n\\nMAKING AMENDS — Assembly [amends] bill allowing for early release of prisoners, by POLITICO’s Matt Friedman: Nearly a month after it stalled, a bill that would allow for the early release many prisoners because of the coronavirus pandemic is expected to be taken up again on Thursday. The Assembly plans to amend the bill, NJ S2519 (20R), to make inmates convicted of murder or aggravated sexual assault ineligible for early release, according to its top sponsor in the lower house. A previous version of the bill, which passed the state Senate in late August but stalled in the lower house, only exempted “repetitive, compulsive” sex offenders. “It is on the board list for the Assembly on Thursday and I am optimistic that there’s sufficient support to pass it, given the fact that we still have the highest prison death rate from Covid-19 in the country,” Assemblymember Raj Mukherji (D-Hudson), the bill’s sponsor, said in a phone interview. “And all of these inmates would have been released within the next 12 months anyway.”\\n\\n4.1 MASTROS — “NJ contracted $37M for contact tracing. Was there a better way to use taxpayer dollars?” by The Record’s Ashley Balcerzak: “It’s become a dangerous cycle. Public health funding is slashed. An emergency strikes. Governments pour money into the problem and then cut funding once again after the crisis subsides. Local health officials in New Jersey fear that this will happen again. The Garden State agreed to pay close to $37 million in contracts to hire and train contact tracers for six months ... These millions are meant to provide quickly deployed backup to the 99 local and county health departments doing this work since March with limited staff and resources — departments that were forced to pull in volunteers and other public employees to help. But these are still temporary measures to respond to a short-term problem, officials say. It’s unclear what will happen when the contracts end and whether local departments will be given sustained funding to cover the basic infrastructure they require.”\\n\\nNORTH JERSEY SENIORS STAND ASKED TO STAND ON LINE, WHILE SOUTH JERSEY SENIORS ARE TOLD TO STAND IN LINE — “MVC starts special senior hours but lawmaker says they’ve bungled that, too,” by NJ 101.5’s Dan Alexander: “The Motor Vehicle Commission on Tuesday implemented special hours for senior citizens and people with medical conditions. But one of the lawmakers who sponsored the law making this possible says the MVC is not doing it right … The MVC implemented the new law on Tuesday by allowing the designated customers to take care of transactions related to new and used car purchases at the MVC vehicle centers. The MVC says customers do not need to arrive before 2 p.m. to get a ticket for service. State Sen. Anthony M. Bucco, R-Morris, says the way the MVC is implementing his law will not work. ‘Essentially, what they\\'ve done is now establish another line for those who shouldn\\'t be standing in line, between 2 and 4.’”\\n\\nRATIOED — Staffing ratio bill amended to save costs for long-term care industry, by POLITICO’s Sam Sutton: New Jersey lawmakers amended legislation requiring nursing homes and long-term care facilities to keep a minimum number of certified nursing assistants on staff, potentially clearing the way for votes in both houses of the state Legislature later this week. Last week, several Assembly Democrats blanched at language that would have compelled nursing homes to staff one CNA for every six residents during the day shift, noting that provisions for other shifts set a broader parameters for which health workers count against the ratio. Amendments to the bill, NJ S2712 (20R), which cleared both the Assembly Budget Committee and the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, decreases the day shift ratio to one CNA for every eight residents.\\n\\nDEFENSE: BY ‘TO GO’ HE WAS REFERRING TO THE INDOOR DINING BAN — “In whistleblower lawsuit, fired AC casino exec claims she dealt with misogyny, retaliation,’ by The Record’s Dustin Racioppi: “A former executive of Ocean Casino Resort in Atlantic City claims she was fired in retaliation for raising concerns the company filed a falsified document with New Jersey’s gaming division and that the state agency’s director suggested to the company she needed ‘to go,’ according to a whistleblower lawsuit filed Tuesday. Loretta Pickus, the former senior vice president and general counsel at Ocean Casino, also said in her complaint that she was discriminated against because she is a woman.”\\n\\nCOME FOR THE HIGHER TAXES, STAY FOR THE SUPERIOR PIZZA AND INDIAN FOOD — “Some New York lawmakers push to follow New Jersey in raising millionaires’ taxes,” by The Wall Street Journal’s Jimmy Vieklind: “Progressive lawmakers and groups said New Jersey’s agreement to increase taxes on millionaires should be matched in New York, and are pushing the state Legislature here to convene soon to consider a revenue package. A coalition of advocacy group … is planning a Friday protest along Park Avenue to call for taxing the income and wealth of billionaires … The novel coronavirus pandemic prompted a $14.5 billion decline in state revenues, but Gov. Andrew Cuomo has pushed off negotiations on adjusting the state budget in the hope that Congress will appropriate additional aid. The Democratic governor said last week that might mean a delay until after the November election. But some lawmakers say New Jersey’s action undercuts that argument, and they will increase pressure for action. ‘I’ve never been jealous of Jersey before,’ said Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou, a Democrat from Manhattan.”\\n\\nYAP — \"Pandemic endangers program that provides support for NJ’s most vulnerable kids,\" by WNYC\\'s Matt Katz: \"The coronavirus is decimating government budgets, leaving politicians to snip away part of the safety net intended to catch the most vulnerable—like 12-year-old Jahsaun, identified by the state of New Jersey as at risk of falling into foster care or juvenile detention. Just about every week, Jahsaun hangs out with Sam Barber from Youth Advocate Programs (YAP), a national nonprofit that contracts with the state to pair advocates with 1,500 kids in all 21 counties. Barber’s role is part mentor, part friend, part guy-who-gets-Jahsaun-out-of-the-apartment ... Governor Phil Murphy planned to cut the YAP program by 55 percent due to coronavirus-related revenue shortfalls that is already leading the state to borrow at least $4 billion to balance the budget. On Tuesday, though, officials with the state senate said lawmakers will vote to restore $3 million to the Department of Child and Families, which funds YAP, but it’s still unclear if that will pay for YAP’s $7.8 million line item in its entirety.\"\\n\\n—“NJ hunters make case for bear hunt on state land as state bear population rises”\\n\\n—“Seeing tweets on billboards?

Colabella explained during a tour on Sept. 14, was to keep this human assembly line moving 12 hours a day, seven days a week, until the last of some 450,000 ballots are mailed out to the county’s registered voters, a process expected to take weeks. To build some momentum, it was decided to prepare ballots for the county’s smallest municipalities first, giving workers a sense of accomplishment from seeing towns crossed off the to-do list, one by one … Voters in smaller Ocean County towns began receiving their ballots in the mail last week. Officials are urging voters to fill out their ballots and return them as soon as possible to avoid a last-minute crush. Predicting how many will do that is next to impossible. ‘Our greatest fear,’ Kean said, ‘is that we’re going to have 350,000 ballots sent out by mail and 350,000 decide to drop them in the mail on Nov. 1, and we get killed because we get all the ballots at the same time.’”\\n\\n—Fulop: “Health not headlines: How cities are shifting the immigration narrative”\\n\\n—“Hunterdon freeholders say JCP&L rate hike should be rejected”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEVERYTHING ELSE\\n\\n\\n\\nR.I.P. — “\\'It\\'s a difficult week\\': Tyler Clementi\\'s mom shares her journey 10 years after son\\'s death,” by The Record’s Hannan Adely: “Jane Clementi packed the belongings from her home in Ridgewood, where she and her husband had lived for 31 years and raised three boys, into dozens of boxes for her move in February.

Deputy Chief Mark Simmons cited the ‘current climate’ in the city and the nation in a June 4 email advising then-Chief La’ron Singletary to press the city’s lawyers to deny a Prude family lawyer’s public records request for the footage of the March 23 encounter that led to his death. The video, finally made public by Prude’s family on Sept. 4, shows Prude handcuffed and naked with a spit hood over his head as an officer pushes his face against the ground, while another officer presses a knee to his back. The officers held him down for about two minutes until he stopped breathing. He was taken off life support a week later. ‘We certainly do not want people to misinterpret the officers’ actions and conflate this incident with any recent killings of unarmed black men by law enforcement nationally,’ Simmons wrote. ‘That would simply be a false narrative, and could create animosity and potentially violent blow back in this community as a result.’ The Western New York city released the emails, police reports and other documents on Monday as Mayor Lovely Warren fired Singletary and suspended Corporation Counsel Tim Curtin and Communications Director Justin Roj without pay for 30 days amid continuing fallout from Prude’s death.

She had to take administrative leave from her job at a nonprofit where she builds social-media campaigns. A month after getting sick in early March, MacDonald was back in the ER, frustrated as she tried to convince her doctors she was mired in her second month of what, she’d been told, was a three-week respiratory virus.

De Blasio said the city is working on a plan to require its own hundreds of thousands of employees to return to work in person, though it will be phased in gradually to make sure the coronavirus stays under control. Under the state’s reopening plan, offices have been allowed to operate at 50 percent of their legal capacity since June. Yet the vast majority of office workers have stayed away: A survey by business groups found that only 8 percent had returned by mid-August, and just over a quarter expected to be back by the beginning of the year.

The announcement Tuesday by state Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker comes just three days after relatives of nursing home residents held a rally outside the governor’s Manhattan office protesting the restrictive policy. The new policy will resume limited visitation for facilities that have been without COVID-19 for at least 14 days — half the 28-day rule that has been in effect since early July. Nursing home advocates and family members said the 28-day infection free policy was too restrictive, with only a small percentage of the 613 nursing homes meeting the criteria to allow visitors. But Zucker said the updated guidance will allow visitation in approximately 500 of the state’s 613 nursing homes.” New York Post’s Carl Campanile and Bernadette Hogan\\n\\n“HUNDREDS of thousands of New York motorists have put off their vehicle inspection during the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving auto shops bracing for an onslaught of customers whenever Gov.

McMahon, with the conservative leaning fiscal watchdog group, the Empire Center, and Ron Deutsch, with the liberal leaning Fiscal Policy Institute, do agree on some things. One- that the amount of the state deficit is huge, Cuomo’s budget office estimates it has grown to $14.5 billion dollars. And two, that it’s time to be worried. ‘I think alarm bells should be going off all over the place right now,’ Deutsch said.” New York State Public Radio’s Karen DeWitt\\n\\n— \"Despite a fiscal crisis that led Governor Cuomo to withhold aid payments for school districts and local governments, the Cuomo administration since spring has approved more than $46 million in new pork-barrel capital grants.”\\n\\n“OFFICIALS at the state Department of Labor on Monday terminated a fugitive with a lengthy criminal history, including arrests for identification theft, who had been among hundreds of clerks hired since March to help process unemployment claims…His termination, which was confirmed by sources in the department, came a day after the Times Union published a story revealing his criminal history and that highlighted what employees in the department characterized as a loosening of the verification process to approve more than 3 million unemployment claims since the coronavirus pandemic struck New York earlier this year.” Times Union’s Brendan J.

Andrew Cuomo is blaming politicians beholden to utility interests for limiting penalties those companies can face when the lights go out. “These utility companies, I believe, would rather pay these penalties for slow response than invest the money they need to actually prevent it from happening,” Cuomo said Tuesday during a radio appearance with Long Island’s Jay Oliver. “There’s a state law that says the state is limited as to how much they can penalize a utility company after a storm or anything like that ... This is a utility protection program.” ... Senate Democrats, who won a majority for the first time in decades in 2018, took issue with Cuomo’s comments. “We agree with the governor that the previous Republican Senate majority was on the side of utility companies and not the public,” said Mike Murphy, spokesperson for the Senate Democrats. “We look forward to changing that.\" POLITICO’s Marie J.

The lawsuits mark an expected and ongoing legal battle spearheaded by religious groups who have decried the governor\\'s limits on religious services amid the pandemic. On Tuesday, Cuomo called for zoned shutdowns in four virus hotspot regions, including portions of South Brooklyn and Queens, and two suburban communities in Rockland and Orange counties that are home to significant numbers of Orthodox residents. In ‘red zones,’ areas with the highest test positivity, no more than 10 people will be allowed to attend houses of worship. The complaint by Jewish groups and individuals, which was filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, described the state\\'s rules as ‘onerous and discriminatory’ and a violation of the First Amendment.” Gothamist’s Elizabeth Kim\\n\\n“HAROLD ‘HESCHY’ TISCHLER strolled onto 13th Avenue in Borough Park at 9 p.m. Wednesday night, bare-faced and hoarse from days of screaming, and into the arms of an adoring crowd. Hundreds of ultra-Orthodox demonstrators chanted his name, waving Trump and Thin Blue Lines flags as they jockeyed for a chance to meet the brash right-wing radio host leading the campaign to stop the new COVID-19 lockdown measures. ‘We are at war!’ Tischler shouted to the crowd of protesters. ‘You are my soldiers!’ An hour later, Tischler directed an angry mob of young Hasidic men as they surrounded and attacked Jacob Kornbluh, a veteran reporter with Jewish Insider …\\n\\n“It was the second straight night of rage and violence in Borough Park overseen by Tischler , a heavyset local agitator who spent a year in prison for immigration fraud. During his demonstration on Tuesday, protesters beat up the brother of a well-known Hasidic whistleblower, swarmed a photojournalist documenting the scene, and set fire to surgical masks in the street. There were no arrests or summonses during either night of unrest, according to an NYPD spokesperson. The chaotic street scene marked the latest escalation in the fight over Governor Andrew Cuomo’s new coronavirus restrictions, which will shut down schools and non-essential businesses in Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods with spiking COVID rates beginning on Thursday. Local Hasidic lawmakers who represent the area have come out against the rules, accusing the governor of singling out Jewish people... But Tischler has gone a step further, vowing to stop the restrictions by force, while peddling conspiracy theories that Democratic officials are deliberately misleading the public about the virus for political reasons.” Gothamist’s Jake Offenhartz\\n\\n— De Blasio and Cuomo both criticized the NYPD’s approach after no arrests were made during the first two nights of protests, where multiple people were assaulted.\\n\\n“AL, AN FDNY EMT who makes ambulance runs all over southwest Brooklyn, has seen a change as of late. While responding to 911 medical calls from Bensonhurst to Borough Park in the months past the pandemic’s peak, he’d field a cardiac arrest case about once every other week, he estimates. But in the last two weeks, he’s logged nearly 10. His wife, an EMT in Brownsville and Crown Heights, responded to four cardiac arrest calls in one day recently, he said. For them, the runs stir memories of near-constant cardiac arrest calls in the spring for COVID-19 patients whose hearts couldn’t get enough oxygen. ‘I’m hoping and praying that it doesn’t get to where it was in March and in April,’ said Al, who requested that his last name not be used because he is not authorized to speak to the press. ‘I don’t foresee that happening again to that level, but I do see there being an increase.’ Citywide, ambulance calls in New York are down from the height of the COVID-19 crisis, even dipping slightly below pre-pandemic levels, officials said. But in and around the city’s coronavirus hot zones in Brooklyn and Queens, emergency workers are spotting a difference lately — and New Yorkers there say they are hearing it, too, in the drone of sirens.” The City’s Rachel Holliday Smith\\n\\n“A BAND OF downtown Manhattan residents are raising nearly $1 million to fight Mayor Bill de Blasio’s plan to relocate homeless residents from an Upper West Side emergency hotel shelter to a permanent facility in their neighborhood, The Post has learned.

But for Roni Mazumdar, who owns Indian restaurants in the city, the news was a harsh reminder that the playing field isn’t the same for every dining spot. Mr. Mazumdar is limited by the fact that he can’t set up an outdoor platform in front of two of his places. At Rahi, located in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village neighborhood, a fire hydrant stands in his way. And at Adda Indian Canteen in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, a bus stop blocks the area. Mr. Mazumdar isn’t alone in facing such problems. Many of the city’s restaurants have been able to offer outdoor service without complications, and plan to keep doing so even as the weather turns chilly. But others are challenged by the city’s rules that govern the pandemic-era outdoor dining program, known as Open Restaurants, that has now been made permanent year-round.” Wall Street Journal’s Charles Passey\\n\\nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK: Eight of the nine candidates for Manhattan District Attorney signed a joint letter to Gov. Andrew Cuomo urging him to use his clemency powers to release older people from New York prisons. The plea was organized by the Jim Owles Liberal Democratic Club, which hosted the first candidate forum in the crowded DA race and asked the contenders to pledge their support for the issue. “We urge you to exercise your executive clemency powers to free all elder prisoners, including those convicted of more serious crimes, unless there is an overwhelming and individualized reason to keep them incarcerated,” write the candidates — Tahanie Aboushi, Alvin Bragg, Diana Florence, Lucy Lang, Janos Marton, Eliza Orlins, Daniel Quart, Tali Farhadian Weinstein — arguing that older people are unlikely to commit new crimes and are at higher risk from coronavirus.

Some new trouble spots: The city is seeing upticks in Covid-19 cases in half a dozen neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens.\\n\\nIn Midwood, Flatbush, Borough Park and Williamsburg in Brooklyn, and Far Rockaway and Kew Gardens in Queens, officials have recorded an increased number of new cases and are warning about illicit large indoor gatherings that may fuel the spread.\\n\\n“We’re now seeing signals that Covid is spreading in some neighborhoods faster and wider than the rest of the city,” said Health Commissioner Dave Chokski, who outlined plans to target the affected areas with testing, mask and hand sanitizer distribution, and robo-calls and sound trucks urging adherence to social distancing rules.\\n\\nThat’s part of a hyper-local approach intended to stop isolated spikes from becoming bigger ones, and it managed to bring numbers back down after a recent uptick in Sunset Park. But the latest problems are more widespread. The spikes in southern Brooklyn have risen to the level of an official coronavirus cluster, dubbed the Ocean Parkway Cluster, the Health Department said Tuesday evening. New cases there have tripled since the beginning of August, and have also tripled in Far Rockaway and Williamsburg, while they’ve doubled in Kew Gardens. Collectively, the neighborhoods make up 20 percent of all cases citywide. Without action, officials say the increases could spread to other areas.\\n\\nCitywide, the infection rate remains just over 1 percent. The reopening of most city schools and indoor dining next week will add more risk factors to the mix.”When these second waves occur, they always start as small problems that expanded to big ones,” said Jay Varma, public health adviser to Mayor Bill de Blasio. “So our aggressive approaches are absolutely critical to prevent that from happening.”\\n\\nIT’S WEDNESDAY.

After a summer of last-minute scrambles to ready city schools for in-person learning, what could be the toughest challenge yet is the recruitment, hiring and training of thousands of new teachers in just over a week. Between 6,000 and 7,000 extra teachers will have to be in place when middle and high schools open Oct. 1 to staff a dizzying array of remote and in-person courses, United Federation of Teachers president Michael Mulgrew told the Daily News. ‘It’s gonna go right down to the wire. It’s not going to be easy,’ he said. City officials, who pushed back the start of in-person school last week to address the staffing crisis, have already committed to 4,500 new staff for elementary schools\\' reopening Sept. 29, and acknowledged they’ll need even more for middle and high schools. They haven’t shared what that number is.” New York Daily News’ Michael Elsen-Rooney\\n\\n— Online classes may be as large as 68 students.\\n\\n— Some students still lack the iPads or laptops they need for online learning.\\n\\n— The Education Department\\'s deputy chancellor of school planning and design plans to take a leave of absence to work on Joe Biden’s presidential campaign.\\n\\n— De Blasio sparked confusion by claiming that students will not have to take online classes while they’re physically in school, even though several schools have already announced plans to do so.\\n\\nBROOKLYN’S MUNICIPAL building will be renamed after late Supreme Court justice and borough native Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday. “It’s personal for all of us as New Yorkers. It’s personal for so many people who are inspired by her as a guiding light and an example,” de Blasio said at a press briefing. “We want to make sure we honor her in every conceivable way, and especially in the borough that she came from.” Ginsburg, who died on Friday at the age of 87, grew up in Midwood and attended James Madison High School. The nearly century-old Municipal Building on Joralemon Street in downtown Brooklyn will now bear her name. POLITICO’s Erin Durkin\\n\\n“THE NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL is considering several bills that would aid restaurants as they try to recover from the economic hit brought on by the new coronavirus pandemic, including one that would make sidewalk and curbside street dining permanent. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced in July that the Open Restaurants program, a key feature of the city’s effort to support restaurants financially during the pandemic, would be extended until Oct. 31. The program allows restaurants and bars to expand outdoor seating in sidewalks, city streets and parking lots to increase revenue while maintaining social-distancing guidelines intended to curb the spread of the virus. As part of the legislation introduced by City Councilman Antonio Reynoso, restaurants and bars would also be allowed to use propane heaters, which are currently banned in New York City. The Department of Transportation would also be required to set up an online application process that can be used by restaurateurs to certify their establishments for outdoor dining, according to the bill.” Wall Street Journal’s Emma Tucker\\n\\n— De Blasio says he’ll make a decision “very soon” on extending outdoor dining past Oct. 31.\\n\\n“NEW YORK CITY’S Civilian Complaint Review Board closed 804 fewer cases in the fiscal year ending June 30 compared to 2019, as average investigation times increased for the fifth consecutive year, according to the latest Mayor’s Management Report.

A USA TODAY Network New York review found the most serious violations revealed how poorly trained workers mishandled COVID-19 contaminated food trays, linens, gowns and mop buckets, potentially spreading the respiratory disease among countless frail and elderly residents. Many nursing homes also failed to isolate infected residents, including cases of healthy residents left to live with roommates who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. One facility was cited for potentially exposing 89 residents to COVID-19 due to the violations. And amid widespread personal protective equipment shortages, one nursing home was cited for keeping its stockpile locked up improperly, endangering workers who complained they lacked masks, gloves and gowns, according to federal and state records reviewed by USA TODAY Network New York.” USA Today Network’s David Robinson\\n\\n“A WEALTHY cosmetics heir and longtime fixture in New York State fundraising politics is donating mightily to a Super PAC that has targeted a half-dozen state Senate Democrats for defeat.

The money will go to fund a program organized by the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition to pay the fines, fees and restitution costs for former prisoners who are already registered to vote in Florida but barred by law from participating in the election because of those outstanding debts. Bloomberg, who has committed at least $100 million to electing Biden in the state, raised the money from individuals and foundations over the past week, his advisers said. He saw the donations as a more cost-effective way of adding votes to the Democratic column than investing money to persuade voters who already have the right to vote, a Bloomberg memo said.” Washington Post’s Michael Scherer\\n\\n“A FEDERAL JUDGE in Manhattan granted a request for relief on Monday from 16 named plaintiffs, including candidates and voters, to ensure that the United States Postal Service delivers absentee ballots on time across the country, and to United States citizens abroad, calling the right to vote “too vital a value in our democracy to be left in a state of suspense in the minds of voters weeks before a presidential election.” Citing the expected surge in absentee ballot use due to the risk posed by the ongoing global pandemic, Victor Marrero, a judge in the Southern District of New York, said the plaintiffs successfully argued that new policy changes implemented by President Donald Trump and his handpicked Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy, were causing service delivery delays that would interfere with the delivery of election mail.

But the development team found “the leadership needed to approve this development failed to emerge,” CEO Andrew Kimball said in a statement to POLITICO Tuesday night. “In late July, it became clear that a number of convergent factors were forcing us to rethink our request to have the property rezoned,” Kimball said. “Now, despite strong support from a growing number of Council Members, the City Planning Commission, a broad coalition of Sunset Park residents and small businesses, and members of the clergy, as well as civic, business and labor leaders and many others who care about New York and its future, it is clear that the current political environment and a lack of leadership precludes a path forward for our rezoning proposal.” POLITICO’s Janaki Chadha\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter Erin Durkin @erinmdurkin\\n\\n\\n\\nAnna Gronewold @annagronewold'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/newsletters/massachusetts-playbook/2020/10/09/warren-to-stump-for-biden-the-case-for-keeping-daylight-savings-tech-snafus-hamper-online-learning-490564', 'Full Text': 'WARREN to stump for BIDEN — The case for keeping DAYLIGHT SAVINGS — Tech snafus hamper ONLINE LEARNING Presented by Public Transit Public Good Coalition\\n\\nGOOD MORNING, MASSACHUSETTS.

John Cornyn (R-Texas), who said trying to follow the frenetic news cycles has been like “drinking out of a water hose.”\\n\\n“Just when you think you have it figured out, something happens,” added Sen.

And House Democrats have passed much of their own ambitious agenda, from police reform to protecting Dreamers to infrastructure, only to see it ignored by the GOP-controlled Senate.\\n\\nThings have gotten so bad, though, that the House and Senate couldn’t renew a law designed to help the victims of violent crimes, let alone another badly needed coronavirus aid bill.

He said the pandemic, however, had confirmed his belief that current political and economic institutions must be reformed to address the legitimate needs of the people most harmed by the coronavirus.\\n\\n“Aside from the differing ways that various countries responded to the crisis, their inability to work together became quite evident,” Francis wrote. “Anyone who thinks that the only lesson to be learned was the need to improve what we were already doing, or to refine existing systems and regulations, is denying reality.”\\n\\nHe cited the grave loss of millions of jobs as a result of the virus as evidence of the need for politicians to listen to popular movements, unions and marginalized groups and to craft more just social and economic policies.\\n\\n“The fragility of world systems in the face of the pandemic has demonstrated that not everything can be resolved by market freedom,” he wrote. “It is imperative to have a proactive economic policy directed at ‘promoting an economy that favours productive diversity and business creativity’ and makes it possible for jobs to be created, and not cut.”\\n\\nHe denounced populist politics that seek to demonize and isolate, and called for a “culture of encounter” that promotes dialogue, solidarity and a sincere effort at working for the common good.\\n\\nAs an outgrowth of that, Francis repeated his criticism of the “perverse” global economic system, which he said consistently keeps the poor on the margins while enriching the few. Francis rejected the concept of an absolute right to property for individuals, stressing instead the “social purpose” and common good that must come from sharing the Earth’s resources.\\n\\nFrancis once again rejected “trickle-down” economic theory as he did in the first major mission statement of his papacy, the 2013 Evangelii Gaudium, (The Joy of the Gospel), saying it simply doesn’t achieve what it claims.\\n\\n“Neo-liberalism simply reproduces itself by resorting to magic theories of ‘spillover’ or ‘trickle’ — without using the name — as the only solution to societal problems,” he wrote. “There is little appreciation of the fact that the alleged ‘spillover’ does not resolve the inequality that gives rise to new forms of violence threatening the fabric of society.”\\n\\nMuch of the new encyclical repeats Francis’ well-known preaching about the need to welcome and value migrants and his rejection of the nationalistic, isolationist policies of many of today’s political leaders.\\n\\nHe dedicated an entire chapter to the parable of the Good Samaritan, saying its lesson of charity, kindness and looking out for strangers was “the basic decision we need to make in order to rebuild our wounded world.”\\n\\n'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/23/gavin-newsom-california-wildfires-coronavirus-420044', 'Full Text': '7. Governors walk a narrow tightrope in a big tent\\n\\nIn liberal California, Democrats are the only game in town. They control every statewide office and wield Republican-proof supermajorities in the Legislature — and that adds up to big ambitions for progressive Democrats and their allies in organized labor.\\n\\nDespite the national caricature of Newsom as a starry-eyed San Francisco liberal, in California he’s always been seen as more of a business-friendly centrist. He also has deep ties to a technology industry that has increasingly clashed with unions. That means Newsom is constantly trying to balance those constituencies as he faces decisions that will inevitably frustrate someone.\\n\\n\"I think it’s fair to say that organized labor has done a very good job of becoming influential in California and that business has done a good job of becoming un-influential over time and you have to appreciate the position the governor is in,\" said Jim Wunderman, CEO of a business coalition called the Bay Area Council. “This is a really important point we’re at now because the business position is not good,\" he added.\\n\\nThe shifting fortunes of Big Tech offer a prime example. Gig economy firms like Uber and Doordash are under intense pressure from organized labor, which championed a law that could upend their business models by forcing them to treat drivers as employees rather than independent contractors. Newsom has consistently advocated for a deal that could placate both sides by bridging the contractor-employee dichotomy, and he has stayed neutral on a tech-funded ballot initiative to get out from under the sweeping labor law.\\n\\nA pandemic-induced recession has intensified those tensions. Democratic mayors, unions and liberal activists have pushed Newsom to raise taxes; business groups have warned that could derail a stuttering economy recovery. Newsom charted a middle course last week when he backed a labor-backed initiative to raise commercial property taxes, but Newsom also flatly rejected a union campaign to raise taxes on the most affluent Californians.\\n\\n“There’s this tremendous chasm and there’s really no way to fit in between it without falling into it,” Wunderman said. “The tech industry has the benefit of knowing him and he understand the future is going to be different,” but “at the same time I do think he has a very focused concern on the plight of people and wants to be the governor who ensure the little guy isn’t getting screwed over.”\\n\\nCarla Marinucci and Victoria Colliver contributed to this report.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/04/duluth-is-still-recovering-from-trumps-visit-426119', 'Full Text': \"POLITICO Dispatch: October 5 President Trump is in the hospital with coronavirus. We know that much. But there are lots of unknowns about his condition, and his medical team isn't filling in the gaps.\\n\\n“Contact tracing President Trump in Minnesota: Who hung out with him for how long?” blared a headline in the St. Paul Pioneer Press. The Duluth News Tribune’s above-the-fold front page read simply, “[Rep. Pete] Stauber traveled with Trump.” No further context was necessary.\\n\\nPhotographs of the Duluth rally appeared on social media with red circles drawn around people standing closest to the lectern — and to Trump. Stauber and two other Republican congressmen who traveled with Trump on Air Force One were pilloried for returning to the state on a Delta Airlines flight on Friday night — apparently flouting airline rules.\\n\\nThe House members’ “stupidity and disregard for the well-being of their fellow passengers is staggering,” Ken Martin, chairman of Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, said in a prepared statement.\\n\\nGary Anderson, the Democratic president of the Duluth City Council, said Sunday that Trump “took risks with the health of our community, clearly, and I think that’s how our community is worse off in the most direct way.”\\n\\nMinnesota, a state Trump lost by fewer than 45,000 votes four years ago, wasn’t supposed to end like this for Trump. It was supposed to be where he stunned all the naysayers this year. Appearing at a rally in Duluth in 2018 to campaign for Stauber, Trump pinched his thumb and forefinger together and told the crowd he’d come “this close” to winning the state, something no Republican has done since Richard Nixon in 1972. One more visit, “one more speech,” he said, and he would have. In 2020, Trump said, “It’s going to be really easy I think.”\\n\\nDuluth is critical to Trump’s ambitions. Though the city itself is a progressive enclave on the tip of Lake Superior, its media market gives Trump a port of entry to the state’s more conservative Iron Range, a blue-collar mining region that, while ancestrally Democratic, has been trending Republican in recent years.\\n\\nTrump carried the congressional district surrounding Duluth by 15 percentage points in 2016, and he will need to juice turnout there this year to compensate for losses in the Democratic-heavy Twin Cities and their suburbs. In a year marked by little campaign travel, Trump has lavished attention on Northern Minnesota, dispatching family members to Duluth and appearing himself in Bemidji, Minn., in mid-September. Several mayors from the area publicly endorsed him.\\n\\nOne them, Larry Cuffe Jr., a former Democrat and the mayor of small town Virginia, recalled Sunday that Trump’s campaign provided hand sanitizer and distributed masks at the rally in Duluth last week. Cuffe and the people he was with were all wearing masks, he said, and he wasn’t worried about contracting the virus there.\\n\\nWhat’s more, Trump looked good to him.

But Democrats ultimately bailed on the initiative the night before it was supposed to be announced, McCarthy said.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump and the GOP — who have made cracking down on China a central campaign theme — have tried to paint Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as soft on China. Democrats, of course, reject the charges and point out that Trump initially touted Chinese President Xi Jinping’s response to the coronavirus.\\n\\nThe GOP's report lays out 83 key findings and makes 430 policy recommendations, two-thirds of which are bipartisan, according to McCarthy. Since its inception, the task force has met with 125 people, including policy experts, business leaders, lawmakers, and current and former administration officials.\\n\\n“It is not only the most thorough report on China in the history of the House, it’s bold, achievable, and bipartisan,” McCarthy told reporters. “It doesn’t just lay out the challenges, it lays out the solutions.”\\n\\nThe blueprint calls for securing medical and national security supply chains, striking a bilateral free trade agreement with Taiwan and limiting the Thrift Savings Plan from investing in certain Chinese companies.

Thirty percent of the people in the suburbs are minorities. And so we’re ruining this American dream for everybody,” Trump said.\\n\\n\"They zone you out, they build low-income housing next to your house,\" Trump continued. \"And then I hear I\\'m not doing well in the suburbs. I\\'m not doing well in the suburbs — are you people crazy?\"\\n\\nOne charitable interpretation of his comments is that minorities and low-income people are themselves negatively affected by policies the president opposes. But in his boasts of saving suburbia, Trump seemed to insinuate that minorities and low-income people are overrunning the suburbs and displacing the white voters the president consistently tries to appeal to. Trump repeatedly uses vague language when talking about the suburbs that allows audiences to apply their own interpretations.\\n\\nDuring the debate on Wednesday, the president also decried racial sensitivity training in government agencies, declaring, “I ended it because it\\'s racist.” He vilified the training, which is designed to make workplaces more equitable and tolerant environments, as a program that was “teaching people to hate our country.”\\n\\nWhen repeatedly asked by reporters Wednesday outside the White House whether he would denounce white supremacists, Trump backtracked, saying he\\'s \"always denounced any form, any form, any form of any of that.\" On Thursday, in an interview with Sean Hannity, Trump said, \"I condemn all white supremacists. I condemn the Proud Boys.\" But by then, hate groups like the Proud Boys had already received the message: Minutes after the debate, the Proud Boys crafted a logo with Trump\\'s \"stand by\" phrase.\\n\\nThe president’s remarks are part of a campaign strategy centered on white grievance politics that Republicans have employed since the 1960s. But Trump is using a megaphone.\\n\\nIt was a strategy that proved successful in 2016. But, in 2020, Trump’s appeals to white voters are yielding diminishing returns.\\n\\nThe playbook: Republicans have won a majority of the white vote since the 1960s. And white voters carried Trump to victory in 2016 with white women and non-college educated whites pushing him over the top. His comments Wednesday, which promoted housing segregation, represent one of several heavy-handed appeals his campaign has made to these groups in the hopes of saving his reelection bid.\\n\\nTo win, Trump needs to pull back white women, who started to move away from Republicans in 2018 — and Tuesday’s debate didn’t help him in that area, as a number of Republican commentators acknowledged.\\n\\n“The women voters who are the target audience for last night and the undecided voters — a lot of them are tired with the tone and tenor of this administration and this president,” Alice Stewart, a Republican commentator told CNN.\\n\\nBut Trump continued the white grievance playbook on Wednesday. As part of his false claim that Biden wants to “inundate [Minnesota] with a historic flood of refugees,” the president attacked Rep. Ilhan Omar, who is an American citizen, for her Somali roots. He also falsely accused her of illegal ballot harvesting. The practice is legal in some states, including Minnesota, and allows a third party to collect and deliver ballots.\\n\\n“What is going on with Omar?

The RealClearPolitics national polling average shows the former vice president ahead of Trump by 9 points. According to a late September ABC/Washington Post poll, Biden is leading Trump with all women by 31 points, while Trump leads with all men by 13 points. Trump still maintains his lead with whites overall, but by a much slimmer 6 points. On issues of race and equal treatment of racial groups, the poll found that Biden leads Trump among all registered voters by 20 points.\\n\\nAnother ABC/Washington Post poll out of Pennsylvania found that white women favor Biden by 13 points. Trump still leads with white men there, who support Trump by 21 points. Results from an NYT/Siena College national poll out Sunday show that Biden leads among most voting groups, particularly college-educated whites, who support him over Trump by 16 points. Trump leads among non-college educated whites by 24 points.\\n\\nIn speeches over the summer, Trump lamented the loss of “our heritage” when defending Confederate statues torn down by Black Lives Matter protesters. For more than a month, Trump has been test-driving his housing attack on Biden by threatening that the Democrat will dispatch New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker to the suburbs. Trump denied it was because Booker is Black and claimed that he was doing so because of zoning legislation the New Jersey senator has sponsored. And his administration has repeatedly denied the existence of systemic racism.\\n\\nAgain, it all goes back to his base. A 2019 PRRI survey found that two-thirds (68 percent) of Trump supporters agree with the sentiment that discrimination against whites is as big a problem today as discrimination against Black people and other minorities, according to results provided to POLITICO. That includes 72 percent of male Trump supporters who agree with that sentiment.\\n\\nThe impact: Trump’s appeals to white voters are shoring up excitement among his predominantly white and male base. But that alone may not be enough to carry him to a second term.\\n\\nBiden’s support among voters of color is lower than Clinton’s at this point in the race. But he’s compensating for that with strong backing from college-educated whites. He\\'s winning over more white women — and he\\'s chipping away at Trump’s support among older white voters.\\n\\nRepublicans acknowledge the president’s unwillingness to condemn white supremacists and attacks on people of color could damage his electoral chances. Senate Republicans on Wednesday urged Trump to clarify his statement, a sign of their concerns that the president’s current strategy could threaten their majority.\\n\\nSeveral social justice organizations, including the Movement for Black Lives and Color of Change, quickly rebuked the president’s comments on debate night, saying his telling the Proud Boys to “stand by” is a rallying cry to white nationalists. with the phrase.\\n\\nThe president’s failure to condemn white supremacists and the Proud Boys ends up amplifying such extremist groups online and helps them grow in size and impact.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve seen a tremendous uptick in content involving white supremacy topics and the Proud Boys, more specifically, since the president made these comments during the debate,” said Dipayan Ghosh, co-director of digital platforms for the Democracy Project at Harvard and a former policy adviser at Facebook.\\n\\nAnd in the past four years, Ghosh said, “white supremacists, and more broadly the far right, have become a lot more impactful in online spaces.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/13/supreme-court-allows-census-count-to-cease-429248', 'Full Text': 'In a statement Tuesday night, the Census Bureau said counting would end on Thursday.

In early August, the bureau officially announced it was reversing its request for an extension and would deliver apportionment data to Trump by the end of the year, executing a replan that would end enumeration by the end of September and deliver apportionment data by the end of the year.\\n\\nThis infuriated community groups, municipalities and congressional Democrats, who all argued that the accelerated schedule would lead to a deeply flawed count that would reverberate over the next decade.\\n\\n“Defendants could not then, and certainly cannot now, produce an accurate and complete census by the statutory deadline,” the plaintiffs in the case, which include the National Urban League, wrote in a brief to the court.\\n\\nEarlier on Monday, the Census Bureau announced that it had counted 99.9 percent of American households: 66.8 percent through self-response, and 33.1 percent through nonresponse followup.\\n\\nIn her dissent, Sotomayor rejected an argument from the government that the count was already satisfactory. “Even a fraction of a percent of the Nation’s 140 million households amounts to hundreds of thousands of people left uncounted,” she wrote. “And significantly, the percentage of nonresponses is likely much higher among marginalized populations and in hard-to-count areas, such as rural and tribal lands.”\\n\\n\"A census count delayed is a census count — and justice — denied,\" said Mayor Sam Liccardo of San Jose, Calif., a Democrat, in a statement responding to the ruling. \"Justice Sotomayor’s dissent perceptively describes this administration’s outrageous attempts to do everything but ensure a full and fair census count.\" The city of San Jose was one of the plaintiffs.\\n\\nU.S. District Judge Lucy Koh, whose order the Supreme Court stayed, ruled last month that decennial count must continue, ordering that the schedule the Census Bureau\\'s attempt to wrap up enumeration was not feasible, and the bureau should follow the schedule the agency requested at the onset of the pandemic.\\n\\nKoh and the Trump administration battled in the initial stages of the litigation, with the agency initially forging ahead trying to wrap up enumeration by Oct. 5, just days after the revised end date of Sept. 30.\\n\\nEarly this month, Koh, the San Jose-based Obama appointee, ordered the agency continue enumeration through the end of this month.\\n\\nIn the wake of her orders requiring the Census Bureau to keep seeking responses, Koh received a flurry of emails from rank-and-file census workers claiming that supervisors were pressing to wrap up the count despite her directives. Koh has repeatedly demanded explanations from the Trump administration and at one point floated holding Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for defying one of her orders. The Commerce Department oversees the Census Bureau.\\n\\nThe DOJ asked the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to stay Koh’s directives to the Census Bureau, but a three-judge panel last week unanimously rejected the administration’s bid to stop the count. The appeals judges — all Clinton appointees — did lift Koh’s order that the Commerce Department not seek to meet the year-end deadline for a count to be used to apportion House seats starting with the 2022 elections.\\n\\nA report from Commerce Department\\'s Office of Inspector General in September found that the decision to accelerate the census schedule “was not made by the Census Bureau” and that it “increases the risks to obtaining a complete and accurate 2020 Census.”\\n\\n“Senior career officials at the Bureau perceived that this decision resulted from the Administration no longer supporting the schedule extension, but ultimately they lacked visibility into this decision process,” the report read. “Bureau leaders continued to believe that the statutory extension was preferable, and would give the Bureau the best chance to create a high-quality, usable census.”\\n\\nThe Supreme Court’s order is the latest development in the legal fight over the decennial count that was thrown into havoc by the pandemic. Before rolling out the accelerated timeline, Trump asked the Census Bureau to provide apportionment counts excluding undocumented immigrants — a request that would represent a shift from previous practice and is also tied up in court from litigants who say it is unconstitutional.\\n\\nA separate panel of judges blocked that memorandum in September, which has also been appealed by the government to the Supreme Court.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/12/amy-coney-barrett-trump-republicans-429064', 'Full Text': 'POLITICO Dispatch: October 13 President Trump has demanded to know the results of the election on Nov. 3, despite the fact that it could be days until we know the winner.

Some of his colleagues are increasingly worried there won’t be a second term, and that Trump\\'s trajectory threatens their majority as well.\\n\\n“It’s a trend and it’s going in the wrong direction,” said one Republican senator of Trump’s polling. “I think Republicans have a better chance of keeping the Senate than Donald Trump has of winning the election.”\\n\\nSen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) slammed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows during a Saturday conference call to discuss the $1.8 trillion stimulus proposal they floated to Pelosi, saying it would be “the death knell for our majority if Pelosi gets this win,” according to sources on the call.\\n\\nWhen asked Monday about her concerns with the White House’s position on the Covid relief talks, Blackburn said she instead backed a $300 billion bill crafted by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). Democrats blocked debate on that measure a month ago, rejecting it as way too little to help the slumping U.S. economy.\\n\\n“I like the package that we had on the floor,” Blackburn told reporters following the first day of Barrett’s confirmation hearings. “It was the right approach.”\\n\\nBlackburn, however, denied there was any serious divide with Trump or the White House.\\n\\n“There is a lot that we agree on and we’re going to do just fine this week,” the Tennessee Republican said following the first day of hearings on Barrett’s nomination. Blackburn serves on the Judiciary Committee.\\n\\nWith calls for more help coming from Trump, business leaders and average Americans, Senate Republicans are discussing possibly holding a vote on another GOP aid bill next week, a reflection that the party needs to show it’s still trying to address the biggest crisis in the country, according to people familiar with internal party discussions. Democrats have rejected any piecemeal legislation, and Republicans have tried to shift the blame onto them for the long delay in a new coronavirus assistance package, though Pelosi first passed another bill in May.\\n\\n“Once you take a look at the things Nancy Pelosi is promoting, both in terms of the price and the policy, we have a lot of concerns about that,” Senate Republican Conference Chair John Barrasso of Wyoming said in an interview on Monday. “But we’ve put forth what we thought was a good faith effort, and [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer and the Democrats voted no, every one of them. ... We’re united on that.”\\n\\nOf course, after Republicans spent the day attacking Democrats for obstructing a smaller bill, Trump turned his attention to his own party on Twitter: \"Republicans should be strongly focused on completing a wonderful stimulus package for the American People!\"\\n\\nYet Trump has only limited influence in the legislative sphere and his sinking political fortunes are further undercutting his agenda. The president seems to pay little heed to what’s happening on Capitol Hill on a daily basis, but then will claim that a major health care or tax cut package is going to be heading to his desk soon, despite the fact that nothing of the kind is even being considered by Congress.\\n\\nTrump’s current political standing seems to have hurt his ability to persuade Senate Republicans to embrace more deficit spending. Some on Saturday’s conference call between Senate Republicans, Mnuchin and Meadows saw the frosty reception for the senior administration officials as a reflection of a party becoming less and less deferential to the president.\\n\\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany insisted “Senate Republicans will ultimately come along with what the president wants.” But if it’s anything close to the $1.8 trillion discussed by the Trump administration and Democrats, Braun surmised: “I can’t vote for it.”\\n\\n“The only ones who will come up looking good at it are the Democrats,” said Braun, who criticized proposals to send undocumented immigrants stimulus checks and expand some Obamacare coverage.\\n\\nEven the handling of Barrett’s nomination became a point of contention between Senate Republicans and Trump on Monday. Within minutes of the hearing’s start, Trump essentially demanded that his party fast-forward through the planned four days of hearings and confirm her, and then immediately pass a relief bill.\\n\\n“The Republicans are giving the Democrats a great deal of time, which is not mandated, to make their self serving statements relative to our great new future Supreme Court Justice. Personally, I would pull back, approve, and go for STIMULUS for the people!!!” Trump tweeted.\\n\\nThe Judiciary panel’s chair, Sen. Lindsey Graham, whose South Carolina Senate seat is now vulnerable due to his alliance with Trump, quickly brushed off the Trump’s comments.\\n\\n“With all due respect to the president, the committee is following the traditions of the committee,” Graham said. “It’s good for the country to have this hearing.”\\n\\nMarianne LeVine contributed to this report.'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-shift/2020/10/14/senate-to-vote-on-another-aid-package-next-week-790974', 'Full Text': \"Senate to vote on another aid package next week\\n\\nEditor’s Note: Weekly Shift is a weekly version of POLITICO Pro’s daily Employment & Immigration policy newsletter, Morning Shift.

It would also enact coronavirus infection liability protections for businesses and send more cash to hospitals, among other things.\\n\\nBig picture: The measure is a far cry from the nearly $2 trillion bill Democrats had demanded, and nearly as far from the $1.8 trillion compromise the White House — over Republican objections — had offered them. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has already denounced the package.\\n\\nMORE: “McConnell dares Democrats to block 'targeted' Covid relief before election,” from our Burgess Everett and Sarah Ferris\\n\\nSupreme Court\\n\\nSCOTUS GIVES TRUMP OK TO CEASE CENSUS COUNT: “The Supreme Court has cleared the Trump administration to proceed with its plan to end enumeration for the decennial census early, blocking a lower court order that required the government to continue with the count as originally planned through the end of October,” our Zach Montellaro and Josh Gerstein report.\\n\\nBACKGROUND: “After initially claiming it required an extension due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Trump administration switched gears this summer and said it would end enumeration a month early, by Sept. 30, so it could produce census data for apportionment of congressional districts for the next decade by the end of the year.” SCOTUS’ move clears an obstacle to one of President Donald Trump’s major immigration goals.\\n\\nSTATE OF PLAY: Trump instructed the Census Bureau in July to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census count for the purpose of congressional reapportionment — a request that is separately tied up in court from litigants who say it is unconstitutional. Last month, a separate panel of judges blocked that memo.\\n\\nBut the Department of Justice has appealed that decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that “expedited consideration” is needed due to fast-approaching statutory deadlines. The Commerce secretary must deliver the census data to the president by Dec. 31, and the president in turn must give apportionment counts to Congress by Jan. 10, 2021. (More details on that from Zach.)\\n\\nAs our Steven Shepard has noted, the new, shorter timeline provided for by Tuesday’s ruling could allow the Trump administration to finalize the census count — and exclude undocumented immigrants, if granted a favorable ruling by SCOTUS — before the inauguration of a President Joe Biden.\\n\\nIn the States\\n\\nCALIFORNIA AFFIRMATIVE ACTION MEASURE UNLIKELY TO PASS IN NOVEMBER: Polls are showing that Californians are likely to reject Proposition 16, a state ballot measure that would allow an applicant’s race and gender to be considered in public college admissions and public-sector hiring, our Alexander Nieves reports.\\n\\n“The surprising mood of the California electorate is confounding state lawmakers and political strategists, who believe the moment is riper than ever to repeal” a 1996 ban on affirmative action, Alexander writes. “A defeat now could delay the return of affirmative action for years, squandering a 2020 opportunity with racial justice top of mind for voters across the U.S.”\\n\\nNEW YORK WINS SUIT OVER TRUSTED TRAVELER PROGRAM: A federal judge handed Gov. Andrew Cuomo a victory in his long-running fight with the Trump administration over a prohibition on New Yorkers enrolling in expedited border-crossing programs, our Bill Mahoney reports.\\n\\nAlthough DHS ended the ban in July, Southern District of New York Judge Jesse Furman wrote in an opinion issued Tuesday that the move was “unlawful” from the get-go and that it should be vacated to “ensure that it cannot be reinstated.”\\n\\nBACKGROUND: “The Department of Homeland Security imposed the prohibition in February, saying that New York’s new law allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses made it impossible to properly vet applicants to the programs,” Bill writes.\\n\\nAround the Agencies\\n\\nSCALIA’S WIFE TESTS POSITIVE FOR COVID-19: Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia’s wife, Trish, tested positive for coronavirus Tuesday afternoon, DOL announced in an email Tuesday night, and “is experiencing mild symptoms but doing well.” The Labor Secretary tested negative on Tuesday evening, according to DOL, and “has experienced no symptoms.”\\n\\nLabor Secretary Eugene Scalia and his wife Trish walk by the Supreme Court building on Wednesday, Sept. 23, 2020, in Washington. | AP Photo/Andrew Harnik\\n\\nScalia and his wife, as well as his mother, Maureen, were in the second row during a Rose Garden event for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett on Sept. 26 that was also attended by at least 10 people who later tested positive for Covid-19, according to the Washington Post. “All three also were inside the White House for a private reception with Trump and Barrett.”\\n\\n2020 Watch\\n\\nBIDEN REVIVES FIZZLED ‘BUY AMERICAN’ HOPES: The Democratic presidential nominee is attempting to do for American manufacturing what Trump could not, our Doug Palmer reports.\\n\\nThe plan: “Biden hopes to win back blue-collar voters who deserted Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election with a four-year plan to spend $400 billion on federal government purchases of an array of American-made goods,” Doug writes. “Biden also promises to invest another $300 billion to develop technologies like electric vehicles, 5G networks and artificial intelligence.”\\n\\nThe goal: “The two initiatives will help create at least 5 million new jobs in manufacturing and innovation, the Biden campaign contends. If realized, that would boost manufacturing jobs to around 17 million, a level not seen in the United States since the early 2000s.”\\n\\nIn the Workplace\\n\\nLAB STAFF SHORTAGES SLOW COVID TESTS: “As the U.S. has processed more than 1 million daily Covid-19 tests four times in the past week, the demands placed on laboratories are exacerbating longstanding staffing shortages,” Brianna Abbott reports for The Wall Street Journal. Now, some laboratories are “hiring traveling laboratory scientists, investing in automation and sometimes flexing schedules or raising salaries.”\\n\\n“Laboratories that don’t have adequate staff sometimes have to limit the amount of testing they can do, which can force them to reduce the types of tests they offer,” Abbott reports. “The shortages could also extend turnaround time for test results.”\\n\\nCOMPANIES PUSH BACK RETURN TO OFFICE: More and more white-collar companies are delaying when their employees can go back to working in-person until the summer of 2021, The New York Times’ Gillian Friedman and Kellen Browning report.\\n\\n“Google was one of the first to announce that July 2021 was its return-to-office date.

For reference, that’s more than double the 10 per 100,000 cut off for states that New York officials consider dangerous enough to get on the tri-state travel quarantine list.\\n\\nAside from New York City and surrounding clusters, the Southern Tier is the only other region in the state to have a color-coded danger zone : Broome County was designated a yellow “precautionary zone” last week. The uptick is striking, because the Southern Tier was one of the first regions cleared to begin reopening businesses this spring. And with less trauma from the initial impact earlier this year, it’s more difficult to convince residents of the importance of enhanced precautions now necessary to control the spread.\\n\\nOverall, New York’s tests still come back around a 1 percent positivity rate —- though that ticked up to 1.4 on Tuesday.

The candidates, who span the ideological spectrum, found some common ground: They each vowed to replace de Blasio’s police chief, Dermot Shea, who caught flak for his handling of nightly police reform protests earlier this year, following the Minneapolis killing of George Floyd. They all promised to stay out of the City Council speaker’s race — a departure from de Blasio, who used his newfound influence in 2013 to position his favored legislator to win the powerful post, which is intended to serve as a check on mayors. And to varying degrees, they all questioned his expansive real estate agenda and unsuccessful plan for an Amazon headquarters in Queens, which would have created at least 25,000 jobs over a decade but triggered opposition in part for its reliance on large tax breaks and its end-run around a public review process. POLITICO’s Sally Goldenberg and Joe Anuta\\n\\n“COVID-19 HAS put the MTA in such a dire financial hole that one in every four dollars the agency brings in next year will go to paying off its mountain of debt, says a report released Tuesday by state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli. Historically low use of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s trains, buses, bridges and tunnels has dug a $10.3 billion budget hole through the end of 2023 — and it’s not clear whether the agency will get relief from Congress to cover its losses. DiNapoli said the pandemic — which has so far killed at least 131 transit employees — is the greatest crisis in the MTA’s 55-year history. ‘The MTA desperately needs an influx of federal funds or unheard of service cuts and workforce reductions will happen,’ said DiNapoli. ‘Failure to fund the MTA now could disrupt maintenance and repairs and increase the MTA’s debt to suffocating levels that could take multiple generations to recover from.’” New York Daily News’ Clayton Guse\\n\\n— While only 30 percent of riders have returned to the subway system as a whole since the onset of the pandemic in March, many subway stations in Brooklyn and Queens have recovered at least half of their usual ridership.\\n\\n— “In May, as the city continued to fight to keep down its coronavirus infection rate, Mayor Bill de Blasio appointed transit experts to a Surface Transportation Advisory Council. ‘These councils will provide real world guidance to ensure our plans to reopen the city make sense and keep people safe,’ de Blasio said in a release. The transportation experts submitted a long list of ideas to the mayor this summer. Among the suggestions: aggressively expand street space for pedestrians and ramp up bike lane installation with the goal of doubling ridership; come up with a plan for restricting vehicular traffic in Manhattan like the city did after 9/11, ‘should traffic congestion surge’; and come up with a ‘robust communications plan’ to help New Yorkers get out of their cars and find other ways to get around. The de Blasio administration did not respond to the panel.” Gothamist’s Christopher Robbins\\n\\n“HUNDREDS OF SCHOOL children appeared suddenly on the rainy streets of Borough Park on Tuesday morning. With backpacks in tow, they walked from stoops to yellow school buses, disembarking outside the propped open doors and back entrances of the neighborhood's yeshivas. They moved quickly, heeding the warnings they'd been given to arrive on time or be turned away. Facing an uptick in coronavirus test rates, Governor Andrew Cuomo mandated last week that roughly 300 public and private schools inside nine hotspot zones transition to all-remote learning. Newly-reopened public schools, some of which don't have any confirmed cases of the virus, reluctantly complied. But many private yeshivas are spurning the shutdown order in the ultra-Orthodox stronghold of Borough Park, home to one of the highest infection rates in the city, Gothamist has learned. According to one parent, nearly all of the private yeshivas in the neighborhood have ignored Cuomo's closing order.” Gothamist’s Jake Offenhartz and Scott Heins\\n\\nNEW YORK CITY has begun to see a “leveling off” in coronavirus infection rates in some hotspot neighborhoods, following a weekend enforcement blitz that doled out $150,000 in fines to violators of new shutdown rules. Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday there are early indications that a new round of restrictions, which took effect last week in parts of Brooklyn and Queens, are having an effect. “We are seeing some results. We’ve got, certainly, a lot of work ahead. We are seeing some leveling off beginning in the communities that have been most affected,” de Blasio told reporters. Shutdowns took effect on Thursday under a decree from Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who said nonessential businesses must close, houses of worship can only host 10 people, and all gatherings are banned in red zones where the worst clusters of Covid-19 have occurred. Lesser restrictions apply in orange and yellow zones surrounding the worst outbreaks. POLITICO’s Erin Durkin\\n\\n— There has been a surge in Covid-19 cases across multiple neighborhoods on Staten Island, with five zip codes seeing a test positivity rate more than 2 percent.\\n\\n— It’s unclear whether early voting sites will be able to operate in neighborhoods with Covid-19-inspired restrictions.\\n\\n“THE NYPD’s highest-ranking Hispanic officer, Chief of Patrol Fausto Pichardo, resigned from his position after weeks of tension with Mayor de Blasio, police sources said Tuesday. Pichardo, 43, was named Chief of Patrol less than a year ago, after serving as No. 2 for Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison when Harrison held that position. The NYPD confirmed that he put in his retirement papers, but sources tell the Daily News that City Hall officials are pleading with him to reconsider. The tipping point came after last week’s Orthodox Jewish protests in Borough Park, sources said. Pichardo worked 36 hours straight on Wednesday and Thursday, then went home to fall asleep and missed a call from the mayor, the sources said. When he woke up, he returned the call. But Hizzoner summoned him to City Hall Friday to give him a tongue lashing for not answering the phone, the sources said.” New York Daily News’ Thomas Tracy, Graham Rayman, Rocco Parascandola and John Annese\\n\\n— The NYPD created a committee to “reimagine” its policing, in line with a mandate from Cuomo to police departments across the state.\\n\\n— Elizabeth Glazer, director of the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice, is leaving her post by the end of the month.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHAT ALBANY'S READING\\n\\n“TRAVELERS from 38 states and territories will now have to isolate upon entering New York, New Jersey and Connecticut after the three neighboring states expanded their quarantine list again. Michigan, Virginia and Ohio were all added Tuesday to the tri-state travel advisory.” USA Today Network’s Jon Campbell\\n\\n“GOV. ANDREW CUOMO’S new book was released Tuesday, and simultaneously serves as a definitive chronicle of decisions made by officials in New York to address the COVID-19 pandemic and a sharp rebuke to the federal government’s perceived failure to act. Cuomo’s noted, more than once, that the book is not a signal that the pandemic is over, but a retelling of the height of the crisis in New York, where the virus has killed more than 33,000. The book, titled ‘American Crisis,’ is Cuomo’s attempt to convince readers that New York formed a competent response to the pandemic, while characterizing President Donald Trump and his administration as careless and dismissive to the virus. ‘Trump did more to hurt us than to help us,’ Cuomo writes. ‘Anytime there was a function that needed to be performed by government, Trump instinctively withdrew.’” New York Now’s Dan Clark\\n\\n“OVER THE PAST DECADE, more than 700 reviews of child deaths in New York were kept hidden by a state agency , decisions denying the public answers about whether Child Protective Services (CPS) workers failed those children. The most recent suppression stems from an unusually high-profile case: The January death of Thomas Valva, the autistic 8-year-old who had allegedly been beaten by his father, then forced to sleep in a freezing garage in Suffolk County, Long Island, where he froze to death. By law, after the death of a child in the CPS system, the state Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) must create a report examining whether CPS workers followed required protocols in investigating allegations of abuse that had been reported prior to the fatality. But OCFS has discretion about whether to release the resulting report, and often employs an exemption that blocks disclosure — a step the agency has taken in the Valva case. ‘I’m just flabbergasted that they would take a position like that,’ said attorney Jon Norinsberg, who is representing Thomas Valva’s mother in a negligence case against Suffolk County.” Times Union’s Chris Bragg\\n\\n“BUFFALO POLICE have released body camera footage of New York State Supreme Court Justice Mark Grisanti shoving an officer after a fight with his neighbor, then invoking his friendship with the mayor and family ties to law enforcement, before successfully avoiding arrest. Police said Grisanti was drunk at the time. Law360 obtained the videos of the police detaining Grisanti and his wife late last week through a Freedom of Information Law request. The profanity-laced footage reveals in detail that the state senator-turned-judge used physical force against police and justified it, repeatedly threatened officers, and touted his political connections... In the video, Justice Grisanti is seen charging toward and shoving an officer trying to arrest his wife as the officer threw her down on their front lawn after she refused to stop screaming. The judge was restrained by a second officer but repeatedly demanded his wife's release, while listing his close connections to powerful people in Buffalo, notably his ‘good friend’ Mayor Byron Brown and ‘cousin’ Deputy Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia.” Law360’s Frank G.

Andrew Cuomo a victory in his long-running fight with the Trump administration over a prohibition on New Yorkers enrolling in expedited border crossing programs. The Department of Homeland Security imposed the prohibition in February, saying that New York’s new law allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses made it impossible to properly vet applicants to the programs. But DHS decided to end the ban in July when it was forced to admit that it had made false claims in court filings. Officials had justified their actions by saying that New York’s decision to block federal agencies from obtaining DMV records was unique; several other states actually impose similar rules. In the opinion released on Tuesday, Southern District of New York Judge Jesse Furman wrote that the federal decision was “unlawful” from the get-go and that it should be vacated to “ensure that it cannot be reinstated.” “The decision was plainly arbitrary and capricious,” he wrote. POLITICO’s Bill Mahoney\\n\\n“THE SUPREME COURT has cleared the Trump administration to proceed with its plan to end enumeration for the decennial census early, blocking a lower court order that required the government to continue with the count as originally planned through the end of October. The high court’s order Tuesday granting the Justice Department’s request for an emergency stay offered no explanation for the decision, which required the support of at least five justices. Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a written dissent. After initially claiming it required an extension due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Trump administration switched gears this summer and said it would end enumeration a month early, by Sept. 30, so it could produce census data for apportionment of congressional districts for the next decade by the end of the year. Sotomayor, an appointee of President Barack Obama, was the only justice on the shorthanded, eight-member court to note her dissent. She called the harms from ending the count early ‘avoidable and intolerable.’” POLITICO’s Zach Montellaro and Josh Gerstein\\n\\n... 2020 VISION ...\\n\\n“THE REPUBLICAN JEWISH Coalition is dropping a massive ad buy and launching an aggressive get-out-the-vote effort to assist Rep.

But the court ruled on Tuesday that Trump can end the census count now, about two weeks early. Census officials plan to wrap up the enumeration on Thursday, which means census-takers can submit their information over the phone or online by the end of the day tomorrow, or mail in their response as long as it is postmarked by Oct. 15.\\n\\nWhat that means for the count in Massachusetts is not entirely clear. Census officials say the response rate in Massachusetts is 99.9%. But Secretary of State Bill Galvin says that number is \"an obvious fiction.\" The census was initially slated to end July 31, but was extended due to the pandemic.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what Wilbur Ross is smoking, but it must be good,\" Galvin quipped after seeing the numbers, in a reference to the Commerce secretary, according to a MassLive.com report.\\n\\nGalvin\\'s office had been preparing to make a final push this weekend with local leaders in undercounted cities and towns to urge residents to take the census.\\n\\n“This decision by the Supreme Court to allow the Trump Administration to stop the census count early is going to shortchange Massachusetts,\" Galvin said in a statement to POLITICO. \"Allowing the Trump Administration to stop the count now will leave those residents uncounted for the next ten years. Certainly, the phrase \\'stop the count\\' coming from this administration is a chilling one, as we head into November.”\\n\\nIt\\'s likely that students, immigrants and people in urban communities are being undercounted, according to state Rep. Paul Mark, who chairs the House Committee on Redistricting. The impact of undercounting residents is twofold, Mark said. The census count impacts the way districts are drawn and how political power is allotted on the state and federal levels. And a higher census count means more state and federal funding for cities and towns.\\n\\n\"Before Covid, the estimate was every person that doesn\\'t fill out the census costs their community almost $2,400 a year for the next 10 years,\" Mark said. \"With the response to a crisis that could continue for we don\\'t know how long, I think those numbers can only can only go up.\"\\n\\nHave a tip, story, suggestion, birthday, anniversary, new job, or any other nugget for the Playbook?

As Amy Coney Barrett sits in a Senate hearing room this week, it’s also the Constitution itself that is on trial—and showing its cracks.\\n\\nThere’s no provision anywhere in the Constitution to prevent total partisan takeovers of one or more of the branches of government. The framers wanted to build an effective national government while creating institutional roadblocks to stymie the excesses of democracy, but their theory of tyranny was simplistic. They worried that one faction could control more than one branch of government, and their design choice for dealing with that problem was fairly tepid: separate functions, harness self-interest to counteract self-interest and hope for the best. The idea of ideological fairness, or partisan balance, that seems to motivate many Americans today wasn’t part of the framers’ thinking. This was because partisan dysfunction wasn’t a problem they had thought through carefully.\\n\\nIf it had been, they could have established explicit rules about the makeup of the court, say, by limiting the number of justices any particular president could appoint, by establishing term limits, or by lodging the selection power in some nonpartisan body. In fact, the framers thought the biggest risk to liberty was the Congress, and couldn’t imagine that the judiciary would ever grow out of its role as “the least dangerous branch.” As a result, they said very little about what they expected judges to do beyond construe a written constitution and apply statutes.\\n\\nTheir major blind spot was not anticipating the problems created by political parties. Early parties were not national in nature and didn’t seek to police ideological discipline to the same degree as modern parties. A politics driven by national parties created fresh problems because every organization has an imperative; a party seeks to seize control of existing levers of power and impose its worldviews on the rest of the country.\\n\\nA president wanting a nominee who will approve his policies is certainly nothing new. In 1801, John Adams’ appointment of John Marshall to the Supreme Court after Thomas Jefferson’s contested presidential victory aimed to preserve the gains of the Federalist Party. Since then, it’s the sheer scale and means of partisan entrenchment that have changed. Along the way, the rise of the Supreme Court’s power to strike down unconstitutional laws, famously defended by Chief Justice Marshall, has exacerbated partisan dysfunction rather than corrected for it. The court’s move to the center of America’s cultural life has opened up new opportunities for partisan gamesmanship, while fooling too many citizens that such outsize influence should never be scrutinized.\\n\\nDespite conservative hand-wringing about “activist judges” expanding rights, for most of American history federal courts have stood in the way of human rights, such as when the Supreme Court shut down civil rights laws right after Reconstruction, prolonging segregation for decades, or when it approved the removal of Japanese Americans to internment camps during the Second World War. The most notable exception was the Warren court years of the 1950s and ’60s, when the justices entrenched liberal ideas such as expanded rights for the accused and the separation of church and state.\\n\\nThe Warren court’s activism actually caused two long-term problems, both of which contributed to the SCOTUS wars. One is that having the court codify policies, especially in the absence of a true national consensus, sometimes led to backlash that ultimately eroded those gains—even while leaving in place the myth that courts always help the little guy or consistently interpret the Constitution correctly.\\n\\nThe other problem is that both parties now see the courts as the best way to push their longer-term cultural goals. In the days of the Warren court, conservatives argued that the power of judges needed to be reined in: Relying on judges to lock in important culture-war victories like the right to abortion was essentially anti-democratic. Indeed, this was the central message of the “Impeach Earl Warren” movement. The natural solution, they argued, should be to reduce the influence of the courts and return debates back to the people.\\n\\nNo longer. Today, the GOP is all-in on the tactics of legal liberalism to dismantle the constitutional achievements of those with whom they disagree. Instead of trying to get rid of judicially created rights, conservatives focused on persuading judges to establish new rights or expand those rights favored by conservatives, such as the right of corporations to engage in free speech or the right of religious employers to opt out of civil rights laws. That strategy is best encapsulated by the Federalist Society, the national networking group that both grooms and offers a seal of approval of “originalist” judges who can reliably be counted on to help dismantle the administrative state, uphold voting restrictions on voting rights, and impede progressive goals such as national health care.\\n\\nThe GOP’s decision to double down on the courts, rather than chip away at their power, has paid off with monumental decisions like DC v. Heller, won in the Supreme Court, which recognized an individual right to bear arms for the first time. But it has also raised expectations that further control of the judiciary was the key to wins on big national policy issues such as rolling back regulation of weapons, obliterating the right to reproductive autonomy, expanding religious freedoms in the public square, increasing access to public funds for religious groups, and stemming the rights of sexual minorities. Ideological domination of the judiciary, rather than intellectual or partisan balance, or winning seats in Congress, would be the key to this transformation.\\n\\nThere’s another reason the Supreme Court wars have become so intense: changes to the parties themselves. As the GOP’s big-tent strategy of the 1980s has turned into appeals to a smaller slice of America, the party has found it harder to win a national majority in an increasingly diverse country—and so controlling key levers like the judiciary (and the Electoral College) have become crucial to its ability to govern.\\n\\nAt this very moment, a president who came to power without earning the majority support of Americans has doubled down on the courts as a major part of his efforts to stay in office, hoping that a conservative court will rule his way in any electoral dispute. Much of the blame for that can be laid at the feet of the court itself, which ended the disputed 2000 election in Bush v. Gore by stopping the recount in Florida. In doing so, it opened the floodgates to election-related lawsuits and increased the odds that a party could retain power even though it loses the popular vote.\\n\\nThat precedent looms large in Trump’s opposition to mail-in voting and other measures in lawsuits around the country. The president and his allies have admitted they are rushing to fill the position left by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death “to stop the ballots,” betraying the degree to which the party has come to rely on judicial power to retain political power. As Senator Lindsey Graham said the other day, “[I]f the Supreme Court decides that Joe Biden wins, I will accept the result. The court will decide, and if Republicans lose, we’ll accept the result.” That is not how the founders envisioned choosing a president.\\n\\nDemocrats, however, have also continued to depend on the courts to enhance their political fortunes: notably, when it comes to striking down restrictions on immigration and abortion, which are popular with that party’s base, even though most Americans have complicated views on these issues. On racial equality and LGBTQ rights, judges have been rendering parsimonious interpretations of the Constitution for decades, but the occasional high-profile victory in the courts (e.g., forbidding racially separate schools, decriminalizing sex between gay people, or establishing same-sex marriage) has been enough to satisfy Democrats rather than convincing them of the need to agitate for new laws that can deal with a broad range of inequities. These trends, more than anything else, have turned Supreme Court nominations into a zero-sum game.\\n\\nThe stakes are now simply too high. Both sides have been deeply invested in the courts, albeit for a slightly different set of reasons.\\n\\nWhat can be done about it? In the broadest sense, our periodic agonizing over individual judges has also papered over the fact that we are long overdue for a convention where we can finally modernize our Constitution, rather than continue to engage in increasingly ridiculous debates over the meaning of words (or their absence) in an 18th-century document.\\n\\nIn the nearer term, there’s no magic bullet, and no shortage of proposals to alter the size of the Supreme Court or reduce its jurisdiction.\\n\\nToday, it makes sense to pay more attention to the ideological range of the federal judiciary than the framers did, and to consider how far out of step the institution can get from the actual beliefs of living Americans—especially if popular acceptance of its rulings matters to us in a way it never did for the homogeneous group deeply skeptical of democracy that authored the 1787 Constitution. As a population, we are more diverse, fractious and cynical about government than ever before. Our needs as a society are unquestionably different from those who lived even a generation ago, never mind 240 years ago. A Supreme Court that’s simply an adjunct to one political party and can obstruct the policies of the majority for too long will accelerate America’s democratic decline. To revive our sense of what politics can accomplish, we have to break our cycle of dependency on judges.\\n\\nIn the short run, though, the incentives for unilateral deescalation are nonexistent. If you act in disciplined fashion while your opponent acknowledges no restraints, you simply get rolled. What we need is a temporary truce forged by statesmen that can lay down some rules of engagement, with clear consequences for breaches. Only when that happens can the more lasting work be done: figuring out how to reform an institution that has become little more than the extension of party politics.\\n\\n'}, {'url': 'https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook-pm/2020/10/13/heres-how-the-amy-coney-barrett-hearing-is-going-so-far-490589', 'Full Text': 'POLITICO Playbook PM: Here’s how the Amy Coney Barrett hearing is going so far Presented by Facebook\\n\\nJudge Amy Coney Barrett told Sen.

We can now all relive the past six months through the eyes of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, if that’s your particular cup of tea. (Looking at you, Cuomo Stan social media accounts.)\\n\\nThe governor made the rounds over the long weekend for the second volume he’s written while in office, “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the Covid-19 Pandemic,” which is being officially released today. It’s largely a compilation of more than one hundred days of regular briefings this year and another hundred of intermittent addresses. He’s thrown in some gems, such the time he left a bottle of branded NYS Clean hand sanitizer on President Donald Trump’s desk after a meeting in the Oval Office this spring.\\n\\nThe book’s release, just three weeks from Election Day, has earned criticism that Cuomo is taking a “victory lap” while New York is seeing rising infection rates in certain neighborhoods . And it’s accompanied by a sweeping New Yorker profile where some describe his “leadership lessons” as more closely resembling exercises in tyranny.\\n\\nCuomo\\'s book has also reignited talk of his future, particularly if longtime ally Joe Biden were to clinch the presidency next month.\\n\\nTo the first critique, Cuomo told CBS during an interview with his daughters on Sunday a version of his standard line — the book is a roadmap for fending off the coronavirus’s continued advances rather than a braggart’s account of success: “There’s no victory here, the game isn’t over... Let’s learn the lesson from the first half of the game and play a better second half.”\\n\\nTo the chatter about his stepping stones — and rumors that he could be in talks for the U.S. attorney general spot — Cuomo told NBC’s “Today” show that he would help Biden in any way he can, but he has “no interest in going to Washington .\" The rumors “are only from people who want to get me out of New York. I don’t know why, but that’s where that’s coming from.”\\n\\nBut Michaela Kennedy-Cuomo, during the CBS interview, did not indicate that talks of Cuomo going to Washington were entirely absent from the dinner table: “I like Dad being in New York. He really likes it here. But, as someone who wishes that I had someone I could vote for who would be more inspiring and someone who seems more competent... if that were Dad, I\\'d be a really grateful and proud American.

CUOMO had barely finished a fairly routine coronavirus briefing earlier this month when he got word that the New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, had just blindsided him. The mayor unexpectedly announced that he intended to close down schools and nonessential businesses in parts of Brooklyn and Queens, where the coronavirus was surging in communities with large Orthodox Jewish populations. Mr. de Blasio asserted that he had been in contact with the state, whose approval was needed. It took less than 24 hours for Mr. Cuomo to fire back . He halted the mayor’s plan to shutter businesses, calling it imprecise and incomplete, and sped up the closure of schools. By the next day, the governor unveiled his own plan: another phased-in lockdown, complete with color-coded maps and a barely veiled message for Mr. de Blasio.” New York Times’ Jesse McKinley, Luis Ferré-Sadurní, Dana Rubinstein and Joseph Goldstein\\n\\nA message from Uber: CA voters & app workers voted overwhelmingly to protect workers’ flexibility and provide new benefits.

Cuomo to move forward with new restrictions on gatherings at synagogues and other houses of worship, finding that the rules did not violate the free exercise of religion for Orthodox Jews. The ruling in federal court in Brooklyn came after Agudath Israel of America, a national Orthodox Jewish organization, sued Mr. Cuomo this week over his latest executive order detailing an array of new restrictions to address rising coronavirus cases in neighborhoods with large populations of Orthodox Jews....The Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn filed a similar lawsuit against Mr. Cuomo, arguing that the restrictions would effectively force at least two dozen churches in Brooklyn and Queens to close. After a separate hearing on Friday, a different judge also declined to block the executive order.” New York Times’ Nicole Hong and Liam Stack\\n\\n— “New York authorities have dished out over $150,000 in penalties since Friday in the city’s new coronavirus hot zones, including five fines for religious gatherings, according to officials. Some 62 fines have been dispensed under the new crackdown in Brooklyn and Queens, according to a Sunday afternoon post on the city’s official Twitter account. The six-figure sum represents a different approach compared to a recent, far more anemic stab at enforcement by the city. City sources noted that five of the fines — for the maximum allowable penalty of $15,000 a piece — were issued to the organizers of Orthodox religious gatherings in Borough Park, Brooklyn that each drew hundreds of people.” New York Post’s Joe Marino and Aaron Feis\\n\\n— “Hundreds of ultra-Orthodox congregants attended an indoor prayer service in Borough Park on Friday in open defiance of Governor Andrew Cuomo newly imposed restrictions on religious gatherings in COVID hotspots. The service was led by a prominent rabbi who tested positive for coronavirus one week ago, multiple sources told Gothamist.” Gothamist’s Jake Offenhartz\\n\\n“POLICE ARRESTED radio personality and anti-masker Heshy Tischler outside his Borough Park home on Sunday for allegedly instigating an attack on an Orthodox journalist. Citing his role in egging on a group of ultra-Orthodox Jews in an attack of a Hasidic journalist on Oct. 7, cops charged Tischler with inciting a riot and unlawful imprisonment, according to police. The 56-year-old vocal coronavirus denier organized two demonstrations in Borough Park on Oct. 6 and Oct. 7 against Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s new COVID-19 regulations. The new rules, which went into effect last week, closed schools and limited religious gatherings to 10 people in New York City coronavirus hotspots... A large crowd egged on by Tischler chased down and attacked well-known Orthodox journalist Jacob Kornbluh, a veteran reporter for Jewish Insider who has written about attempts to flout social distancing guidelines in Borough Park.” Brooklyn Paper’s Rose Adams\\n\\n— The protest organizer was released Monday night and ordered to stay away from Kornbluh. A group of protesters demonstrated outside the journalist’s home after the arrest.\\n\\n“THE NUMBER OF people held in New York City jails has dropped steadily under Mayor Bill de Blasio, and it continued to fall this year as the city emptied out its jails to curb the spread of the coronavirus. But there is one number at Rikers Island and the city’s other jails that has held constant in the last three years, despite the mayor’s strenuous efforts to reduce it: the tally of people in solitary confinement. Even as the jail population dropped, correction officials have relied on solitary confinement to punish about the same number of inmates each year since 2017, records show. And that trend continued in the first six months of this year as the jails released hundreds of people because of the pandemic.” New York Times’ Jan Ransom\\n\\n“BROADWAY THEATERS will remain dark through May 30, 2021, because of the coronavirus pandemic, the industry’s trade group said Friday. ‘Our membership is committed to reopening as soon as conditions permit us to do so,’ said Broadway League President Charlotte St. Martin. The theaters clustered in the heart of New York City closed on March 12, at the onset of the pandemic. It was expected initially that they would be able to welcome patrons back within weeks, but the League said over the summer that the shutdown would continue through early January.” Wall Street Journal’s Charles Passy\\n\\n— Some smaller theaters want to resume performances sooner, saying they are better set up to allow socially distanced seating.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHAT ALBANY\\'S READING\\n\\nTHE LEFTWARD turn in New York’s suburbs, which enabled Democrats to win a historic majority in the state Senate in 2018, has dominated discussions among political observers in the last few years. But another trend, which has gone unnoticed, also helped remake the Legislature in 2018 . Republicans managed to oust three incumbents that year, and these three had something in common: Each represented a district where there were more registered Republicans than Democrats. That left Assemblymember Carrie Woerner, who has represented a district that includes Saratoga Springs and 14 mostly rural towns for three terms, as the only one of the 147 Democrats in the 213-member Legislature to represent a district with a Republican plurality.\\n\\nAnd this year, Woerner is facing arguably the most aggressive challenge of any member of the Assembly as she runs against Dave Catalfamo. That race, coupled with the results from 2018 and the election cycles preceding it, raises some important questions. Democratic politics in New York have always been grounded in New York City, but Democrats from rural and Republican parts of the state — from Sen. Franklin Roosevelt, who helped lead the opposition to Tammany from 1911 to 1913, to Sen. Darrel Aubertine, who effectively had veto over power over how far to the left the majority of 2009 and 2010 could go — have usually played an outsized role relative to their numbers. But in an era of significant polarization, is this sort of Democrat an endangered species? And if so, will rural voters lose their voice in Albany if nearly all of their representatives are from a party that seems likely to remain a powerless minority in the years to come? POLITICO’s Bill Mahoney\\n\\n“AS PART of a sweeping overhaul of the bail system aimed at reducing pretrial incarceration, the state legislature mandated in 2019 that judges setting traditional bail must also offer one of two alternative forms of bail designed to be affordable for low-income defendants. But since the mandate took effect Jan. 1, judges across New York have seldom used one of these bail forms, ‘unsecured bonds,’ and have set the other, [Partially Secured Bond], at dramatically higher rates than traditional bail. By setting PSBs at rates unaffordable for many defendants, criminal justice advocates and public defenders say, judges, who have complete discretion, have in effect nullified a program instituted by the legislature to free more poor people from jail. ‘The battle for bail reform isn’t over, and right now, combatting PSB abuse is the front line,’ said Martin Kaminer, founder of the Emergency Relief Fund, a bail fund that has been working on this issue.” New York Focus’s Akash Mehta\\n\\n“SANDRA LEE has struck a deal to sell the New Castle home called Lily Pond that she shares with her ex-boyfriend, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, for $1.85 million. Real estate broker Greg Schriefer, of Sotheby’s International in Manhattan, confirmed Monday that the governor’s residence for the past 11 years is in contract, with a closing date still to be set … The potential sale reveals inequities in New York state’s broken property tax system, which Cuomo has shown little appetite to fix. The sale would be 39% more than its taxable value.” Journal News’ David McKay Wilson\\n\\nIT’S AMAZON PRIME DAY and a coalition of retailers, manufacturers and consumer groups wants state Attorney General Tish James to step up enforcement on the organized rings using third-party marketplaces to build a business selling merchandise stolen from local retailers.\\n\\n#UpstateAmerica: Fall isn’t free from public health scrutiny this year.

They were instead U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who duped family members into helping them arrest the clan’s patriarch, now behind bars and facing deportation, his devastated relatives and city officials said Saturday. ‘This is a violation of our law,’ said Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, an ex-city police officer, about the duplicitous Thursday bust of Fernando Santos-Rodriguez. ‘You cannot state that you are a municipal police official. You cannot violate the law to carry out the law.’ After getting information from his relatives, ICE agents arrested Santos-Rodriguez, 48, as he arrived at his morning shift as a Harlem restaurant chef.” New York Daily News’ Ellen Moynihan and Larry McShane\\n\\n— De Blasio sent a letter to ICE demanding their agents stop pretending to be NYPD police, saying he has received numerous reports of agents falsely claiming to be local cops.\\n\\n“TREASURY SECRETARY Steve Mnuchin has a message for ailing 9/11 city firefighters whose funding his agency has withheld: we’re not giving your money back — go ask NYC. For years, the U.S. Treasury Department has withheld nearly $4 million from the FDNY’s World Trade Center Health Program to satisfy still-unexplained debts that other, unrelated city agencies have with the feds. Mnuchin sent a letter to Mayor De Blasio on Thursday saying that the city should make up the shortfall.

BUSTOS is from a TRUMP district -- which was part of her calling card when she ran. Democrats don’t put much stock in the poll, and think BUSTOS is going to wallop KING.

What’s unclear is who the NRCC troll factory thinks they’re surprising with this poll when they have much bigger problems to deal with on every front.\\n\\n“The fact that Cheri Bustos has won big in a Trump district is exactly the reason she is the right person to ensure the 30 Democrats in this caucus who also represent Trump won districts come back in three weeks.”\\n\\nSCOTUS WATCH -- “Supreme Court allows Trump administration to end census count,” by Zach Montellaro and Josh Gerstein\\n\\n-- NPR’s @hansilowang: “The Census Bureau says it will keep accepting online #2020Census responses at http://My2020Census.gov through Oct. 15 until 11:59 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time.” Census statement\\n\\nBIG READ … NYT’S ASTEAD HERNDON with a ‘Long Run’ story: “What Kamala Harris Learned About Power at Howard”\\n\\nDAVID SIDERS: “Minnesota shows few signs of flipping — despite Trump's best efforts”: “Donald Trump has fixated on Minnesota since his narrow loss to Hillary Clinton there four years ago.

Even after heavy campaign spending and recent visits to the state by the president and top surrogates, Biden was running ahead of Trump by more than 9 percentage points, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average.\\n\\n“‘I haven’t heard from anyone on the Republican side who’s to some degree confident,’ said Michael Brodkorb, a former deputy chair of the Minnesota Republican Party. ‘I think the best you’ll hear from a Republican in Minnesota is they think that the race is close.’ Four years ago, it was close. Trump lost the state by fewer than 45,000 votes, and immediately after the election began signaling his infatuation with Minnesota. It was one of his few offensive opportunities on the 2020 battleground map.\\n\\n“If he could limit his losses in the Twin Cities and their suburbs and run up turnout in more rural, conservative reaches of the state, Republicans and Democrats alike believed he had a credible chance of winning — something no Republican has done since Richard Nixon in 1972.\\n\\n“The president has traveled to Northern Minnesota twice in recent weeks in an effort to juice his base in a region culturally distant from the Democratic-heavy cities Minneapolis and St. Paul.

New laws that allow for early voting and no-excuse absentee balloting are expected to push voter participation to historic levels, with Democrats the expected beneficiary of low-propensity Michiganders flooding the ballot box. But the simplest explanation for the president’s trouble here is that he’s continuing to hemorrhage support from white, college-educated women in the suburbs of Detroit.\\n\\n“It’s hard to overstate just how badly Trump is performing with this crucial demographic. Over the past several weeks, a raft of internal polls have produced numbers that political professionals here are struggling to comprehend.

The doctor was later identified in news reports as Amin. Through attorneys, he has denied the accusations, and calls to his office were not answered Tuesday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nClark said hospital records show that Wooten’s claims are “demonstrably false.”\\n\\n“These allegations are disturbing and sensational, but they are not supported by reality,” said Clark, speaking by phone from Nashville. “Dr. Amin is a longtime member of the Irwin County Hospital medical staff and has been in good standing for the entirety of his service to the Irwin County community.”\\n\\nThe allegations of forced sterilizations received significant attention from lawmakers, news organizations and human rights groups last week. Attorneys who represent several women have come forward to say that their clients received gynecological treatments from Amin that they did not agree to or fully understand, including one former Irwin detainee, Pauline Binam. Binam said that one of her fallopian tubes was removed without consent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBinam’s deportation to Cameroon was halted last week at the behest of Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.).\\n\\nAmin has a private clinic near the detention facility, but the hospital is the only place where such a procedure would be performed in small Irwin County, Clark said. Amin does not have an ownership stake in the hospital, contrary to some news reports, Clark said.\\n\\nThe Department of Homeland Security has initiated its own investigation into the accusations from Irwin. On Monday, Democratic lawmakers from the House Homeland Security committee released a report alleging inadequate medical care at numerous facilities, but the Irwin detention center was not one of the sites the committee inspected.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.), one of the lawmakers who participated in a virtual hearing Monday to discuss the ICE report, called Wooten’s allegations of sterilization procedures on ICE detainees “one of the most inhumane things I have ever heard.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) wrote a letter signed by 173 lawmakers demanding a DHS inspector general investigation.\\n\\n“There may be at minimum 17 to 18 women who were subjected to unnecessary medical gynecological procedures from just this one doctor, often without appropriate consent or knowledge, and with the clear intention of sterilization,” Jayapal said.\\n\\nIn a subsequent interview, Jayapal acknowledged that she did not know the details of each of those cases, but the number she cited referred to the clients of attorneys with whom she had spoken.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe advocacy group that filed the complaint, Project South, did not make the hysterectomy allegations the focus of its Sept. 14 complaint to DHS, a complaint that alleged there is poor medical care and novel coronavirus risks at the ICE facility. But it was the allegations of forced sterilizations that triggered a firestorm.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“The rate at which the hysterectomies have occurred have been a red flag for Ms. Wooten and other nurses at ICDC,” the Project South complaint said, without identifying other nurses.\\n\\nAccording to Project South, “Ms. Wooten explained: ‘We’ve questioned among ourselves like goodness he’s taking everybody’s stuff out. . . . That’s his specialty, he’s the uterus collector. I know that’s ugly . . . is he collecting these things or something. . . . Everybody he sees, he’s taking all their uteruses out or he’s taken their tubes out.’ ”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPriyanka Bhatt, the attorney at Project South who was the lead investigator for the complaint, said in an interview with The Washington Post that she did not speak to or identify any women who had undergone a hysterectomy. Bhatt said she included the allegations to spark an investigation into their validity.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe legal director at Project South, Azadeh Shahshahani, said by email Tuesday: “We have already heard from multiple attorneys representing numerous women who have suffered abuses reflected by Ms. Wooten’s whistleblowing disclosures. Some of these women are considering speaking up because Ms. Wooten courageously stepped forward. There has been a troubling pattern of misreporting on the health and welfare of detained immigrants held inside ICE facilities, and we look forward to Congress, the Inspector General, and all other relevant offices conducting a full investigation and applying immediate, necessary, corrective actions.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/trump-ice-raids-sanctuary-cities/2020/09/29/99aa17f0-0274-11eb-8879-7663b816bfa5_story.html', 'Full Text': 'Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, probably will travel to at least one of the jurisdictions where the operation will take place to boost President Trump’s claims that leaders in those cities have failed to protect residents from dangerous criminals, two officials said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump has inveighed against sanctuary jurisdictions throughout his presidency, and he has expanded those attacks to include Democratic mayors in cities convulsed by racial justice demonstrations and sporadic rioting after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The immigration operation would sync with two themes of Trump’s reelection campaign: his crackdown on immigration and his push to vilify cities led by Democrats, whom he blames for crime and violence.\\n\\nTwo officials with knowledge of plans for the sanctuary op described it as more of a political messaging campaign than a major ICE operation, noting that the agency already concentrates on immigration violators with criminal records and routinely arrests them without much fanfare.\\n\\nICE officials have repeatedly warned cities and counties considering sanctuary policies that the agency would send more agents to make arrests in their jurisdictions, not fewer, if they go forward with their plans.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“We do not comment on any law enforcement sensitive issues that may adversely impact our officers and the public,” Mike Alvarez, an ICE spokesman, said Tuesday in response to questions about the planned raids. “However, every day as part of routine operations, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement targets and arrests criminal aliens and other individuals who have violated our nation’s immigration laws.”\\n\\nAlvarez said jurisdictions that don’t cooperate with ICE increase risks for agents and the public.\\n\\n“Generally speaking, as ICE has noted for years, in jurisdictions where cooperation does not exist and ICE is not allowed to assume custody of aliens from jails, ICE is forced to arrest at-large criminal aliens out in the communities instead of under the safe confines of a jail,” he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCities and jurisdictions with sanctuary policies that eschew or prohibit coordination with ICE typically refuse to hold immigrants in jail longer than they are required to so that ICE officers can take them into custody. Such cities also do not help ICE by checking the legal status of suspects who are arrested or detained for minor offenses.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nICE agents operating in sanctuary jurisdictions still may take custody of suspected immigration violators, but without local cooperation, they face the added challenge of finding out when those individuals will be released from jail and do not have the benefit of a coordinated handoff.\\n\\nThe policies, which have been adopted in many of the country’s largest cities, have a significant impact on ICE operations by limiting the number of potential deportees who can be easily taken into custody.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAccording to the latest statistics, 70 percent of the arrests ICE makes occur after the agency has been notified about an immigrant’s pending release from jail or state prison. ICE has lodged more than 160,000 such “detainers” with local law enforcement agencies since 2019, the agency said.\\n\\nSanctuary policies also have worsened a backlog of what ICE calls “at-large criminal and fugitive aliens ICE seeks to apprehend,” according to the agency.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOfficials in sanctuary jurisdictions say their policies preserve community trust in immigrant neighborhoods, where officers need residents to report crimes and cooperate with local authorities without fear of being deported.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Trump administration has periodically threatened to run operations targeting sanctuary cities, including one plan to bus migrants from the border and release them in San Francisco and other Democratic-run jurisdictions. The president also has threatened to strip those governments of federal funding.\\n\\nWhite House officials pushed hard last year for a “family op” targeting migrant parents with children, but that effort did not yield the volume of arrests Trump was seeking. The president tipped off that operation, announcing it in a tweet. Some ICE officials privately attributed the operation’s underwhelming results to Trump’s boasting and indiscipline.\\n\\nUpon learning of prior operations, undocumented immigrants in numerous cities have gone deeper underground, fearing that they might be arrested and deported while their children — sometimes U.S. citizens — will be left behind.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe idea for a campaign publicizing criminal arrests in sanctuary jurisdictions has been floated repeatedly during the Trump administration, two officials said, and was actively under consideration this spring before the coronavirus pandemic. After the outbreak, ICE deferred some of its enforcement plans, citing health risks, and during that time, the agency’s arrests dropped by about one-third, statistics show.\\n\\nThe decision by then-acting director Matt Albence was popular with ICE personnel who worried about exposing their families to the novel coronavirus, but Trump administration officials were irritated and wanted the president to be able to run on a campaign of tough enforcement, according to ICE and DHS officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to get into trouble with the White House. Albence retired last month.\\n\\nAlexei Woltornist, a DHS spokesman, said the department “does not comment on or confirm allegedly leaked operational plans.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Monday, ICE announced a dozen arrests in Mecklenburg County, N.C., where voters elected a sheriff in 2018 who curbed the jurisdiction’s cooperation with ICE. That campaign was featured prominently in the Netflix documentary series “Immigration Nation.”\\n\\nIn a statement, ICE official Henry Lucero said the agency “cannot stand by idly while knowing the public is being misled about the role ICE plays in keeping the public safe.”\\n\\n“The fact is local policies prohibiting agencies from working with ICE put you in danger and waste police resources,” Lucero said. “The public should hold its leaders accountable and demand to know what type of criminals are being released from local custody instead of turned over to ICE.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09/15/ice-covid-irwin-complaint-nurse/', 'Full Text': '“If true, the appalling conditions described in the whistleblower complaint – including allegations of mass hysterectomies being performed on vulnerable immigrant women – are a staggering abuse of human rights,\" Pelosi said in a statement. “The DHS Inspector General must immediately investigate the allegations detailed in this complaint.\"\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nICE officials on Tuesday promised to cooperate with an investigation, but denied that widespread hysterectomies were performed at Iwrin. According to ICE, just two such procedures have been performed on detainees there since 2018.\\n\\n“The accusations will be fully investigated by an independent office, however, ICE vehemently disputes the implication that detainees are used for experimental medical procedures,” said Ada Rivera, medical director of the ICE Health Service Corps, in a statement. “To be clear, medical care decisions concerning detainees are made by medical personnel, not by law enforcement personnel. Detainees are afforded informed consent, and a medical procedure like a hysterectomy would never be performed against a detainee’s will.”\\n\\nIn her complaint, Wooten said that she and other nurses had noticed female detainees getting hysterectomies at an improbable rate, and worried that the women didn’t understand what procedure they were receiving, as most medical staff members don’t speak Spanish.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“These immigrant women, I don’t think they really, totally, all the way understand this is what’s going to happen depending on who explains it to them,” she said in the complaint.\\n\\nThe report did not detail any detainees who said they had received a hysterectomy against their will; one woman anonymously quoted in the complaint said that she was scheduled for the procedure without her consent but that it was canceled when she tested positive for covid-19.\\n\\nPriyanka Bhatt, staff attorney at Project South, acknowledged to The Washington Post that she did not speak to any women who had a forced sterilization, and said she included the allegations in the report with the intention of triggering an investigation into whether or not the claims were true.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I didn’t speak to anyone who had one,” Bhatt said. “But the things we have heard are concerning, and we need to find out more information.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShe added, “When investigating human rights abuses, we conduct extensive interviews with immigrants, and our job is to report what they tell us.”\\n\\nICE declined on Monday to comment in more detail on the broader allegations in the complaint, which also alleges widespread failures to adhere to covid-19 safety policies at Irwin. But the agency did cast doubt about its use of anonymous testimony from detainees and former detainees to bolster Wooten’s claims.\\n\\n“In general, anonymous, unproven allegations, made without any fact-checkable specifics, should be treated with the appropriate skepticism they deserve,” the agency said in a statement to The Post.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLaSalle Corrections, the Louisiana-based company that runs Irwin, also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The firm faced similar complaints about coronavirus safety at another facility it runs in Louisiana in July, which a company official denied in later congressional testimony.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nICE has faced scrutiny over its handling of the coronavirus at detention centers, with the inspector general opening an investigation of the agency’s practices in May. On Friday, The Washington Post reported that ICE had fueled a large covid-19 outbreak at a Virginia facility by flying detainees there to facilitate the deployment of ICE agents to Washington to quell protests.\\n\\nIn a statement to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Monday night, ICE defended its handling of the coronavirus, which the agency says has infected nearly 5,700 detainees nationwide and led to six deaths.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“ICE epidemiologists have been tracking the outbreak, regularly updating infection prevention and control protocols, and issuing guidance to ICE Health Service Corps (IHSC) staff for the screening and management of potential exposure among detainees,” the agency said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Wooten says there was widespread disregard for protecting staff members and inmates at the Georgia facility. The nurse worked at Irwin for three years over the course of separate stints, she told the Intercept, but was demoted in July to an on-call position with few hours — retaliation, she claims, for demanding stricter adherence to medical rules.\\n\\n“They’re still not taking this seriously,” Wooten told the Intercept. “Enough was enough.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe 27-page complaint filed Monday details a laundry list of alleged failures at the facility: detainees being ignored or denied tests despite having coronavirus symptoms; others who have tested positive being placed back in the general population; and officials fudging statics on the number of infections.\\n\\nStaff members, Wooten said, were pressured to “work symptomatic and work positive as long as we had a mask on.” Although ICE purchased two $14,000 rapid-test machines, she said, no nurses were ever trained to use them.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDetainees interviewed for the report said that social distancing was impossible and that everyone was given just one mask and no replacement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“We’re in an open dorm room. Our beds are nothing but three feet apart,” an unnamed detainee said in the report. “Our toilets are about four feet apart with a little wall separating them.”\\n\\nAlthough ICE has reported just 42 cases and no deaths from covid-19 at Irwin, Wooten alleged that those numbers are not accurate because officials have not been “reporting all these cases that are positive.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/01/trumps-attacks-prompted-latino-immigrants-get-more-involved-american-civic-life/', 'Full Text': 'How has all this affected Latino immigrants, the targets of this rhetoric and these policies? We surveyed Latino immigrants before and after the election and found patterns of civic resilience. Latino immigrants remain engaged in civic life and are poised to influence U.S. politics.\\n\\nHow we did our research\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn fall 2012, 853 immigrants from Latin America — including naturalized U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents and immigrants who were not legal permanent residents — were randomly selected nationwide for a telephone interview. We sampled from contact lists obtained from marketing research firms, with both cellphone and landline numbers included in approximately equal number. Nearly all interviews were in Spanish. Further details about response rates, weighting and question wordings are available in a publicly archived code book.\\n\\nIn summer 2016, a fresh sample of 1,800 Latino immigrants was drawn using largely the same methods as in 2012. After the election, we re-contacted as many respondents as possible (576) for a follow-up survey during the presidential transition. In the second survey wave, we included 260 fresh respondents to gauge and correct for any attrition biases. In summer 2017, we fielded a third survey wave, which included 321 respondents from the second round of calls along with 233 from the first round who did not answer the second. In the third wave, 500 fresh respondents were added so that the total number of immigrants in the panel amounts to 2,560.\\n\\nCivic stress under Trump\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, respondents expressed a great deal of anxiety. In summer 2017, for example, 53 percent said that Donald Trump scared them. More than 8 in 10 worried that friends or family would be deported. A similarly large majority worried about family finances.\\n\\nBut fear was not the only emotion that immigrants, citizens and noncitizens alike, reported. Many — about 40 percent — also expressed anger toward the president, and an additional 30 percent were angry but not afraid.\\n\\nHow fear and anger affected political attitudes\\n\\nHow did such emotions affect attitudes toward the government and the country overall? We found a pronounced increase in cynicism about U.S. politics under Trump. In each survey wave, Latino immigrants responded to these two questions on government legitimacy, which have long appeared in the American National Election Study:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHow much of the time do you think you can trust the government in Washington to do what is right?\\n\\nWould you say the government in Washington is pretty much run by a few big interests looking out for themselves, or is it run for the benefit of all people?\\n\\nIn summer 2016, 54 percent said that they trusted the government only “sometimes” or “never,” a drop in pessimism from 2012. However, during the transition to Trump and continuing into summer 2017, immigrants’ distrust climbed higher than they expressed in 2012. We found a similar trajectory when asked about whether the government is run for a few “big interests.”\\n\\nPanel survey regression models let us gauge how fear and anger affected attitudes from one period to the next. Deportation worries and feeling both anxious and angry about Trump led to significant increases in political cynicism by mid-2017.\\n\\nBut respondents didn’t lose faith in the trustworthiness of Americans at large. In fall 2012 and across the three survey waves in 2016 to 2017, roughly the same proportion — about a third of respondents — said they “sometimes” or “never” trusted Americans.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhere they wanted to live didn’t shift markedly either. When asked in each period whether they planned to return to their birth country or stay in the United States, only a small minority mentioned plans to leave.\\n\\nImmigrants stayed involved in civic life even while being afraid or angry or both\\n\\nAfter the 2016 election, immigrants did not go underground. In the summer of 2017, 22 percent reported that they’d attended an immigrant rights march or rally. As you can see in the figure below, when asked in summer 2016 whether they had recently attended any political rallies, fewer than 10 percent said yes — about as many as, in 2012, had gone to rallies over the previous four years. While the percentage of Latino immigrants taking part in street demonstrations in 2017 did not reach the level from 2006 — the year that the contemporary “immigrant rights” movement was born — the contrast with 2016 and 2012 is striking.\\n\\nRegression modeling confirms that fear and anger prompted such engagement. What’s more, by summer 2017, Latino immigrants told us they’d became more involved in conventional kinds of civic life, such as attending community meetings to solve neighborhood problems.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat does this mean for November 2020?\\n\\nOur findings suggest that foreign-born Latinos are getting involved in U.S. democracy and — if citizens — will be inclined to vote in November. Despite attacks, Latino immigrants have continued to respect Americans, want to remain in this country and are ready — despite risks — to make their views heard.\\n\\nJames A.

For instance, from 2006 to 2010, California prisons sterilized at least 148 women.\\n\\nWho supports forced sterilizations?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThose who support such sterilization do not necessarily see the procedures as cruel or violent; nor do they necessarily feel animus toward the group they target. For instance, in 2017, Tennessee judge Sam Benningfield was formally reprimanded in 2017 for offering defendants 30 fewer days in jail in exchange for agreeing to be sterilized. The judge claimed that he was trying to give the people in front of his court “a chance … to make something of themselves.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI wanted to know whether this attempt to deny agency to someone to help them was a form of paternalism. Even when not motivated by animus, this attitude can still have discriminatory results. That is because such paternalism often targets non-Whites, particularly Black Americans.\\n\\nI created an original scale to measure this disposition, defined by the pairing of two attitudes: first, a desire to improve Black people’s lives, and second, a belief that the group cannot do so for themselves without aid from a more competent patron. What I call the Black paternalism scale includes a series of questions intended to get at the trade off between wanting to help Black people and allowing them the agency to decide their own fate. I focus specifically on how these attitudes manifest in White Americans relative to Black Americans, but similar dynamics could be found relative to a number of racialized groups.\\n\\nHow I did my research\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn July 2019 I fielded a national survey via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform, with 1,756 White American respondents. Each respondent was asked to answer questions from the Black paternalism scale and then asked whether they supported giving judges the option to order sterilization as a punishment for women who, while pregnant, use crack cocaine.\\n\\nScoring more highly on the racialized paternalism measure strongly predicts support for this policy, even when controlling for a host of other political and racial attitudes that have been validated by other research, like “authoritarianism”, a preference for adherence to a strong central authority, and “racial resentment,” a measure capturing animosity toward Black people. Moving from those who scored at the lowest end of the Black paternalism scale to those who scored the highest, support for sterilization goes up by 30 percent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDespite the support for forced sterilization, Whites who scored high on Black paternalism do not express animosity toward African Americans. In fact, they are significantly more likely than those who score lower on the scale to express positive feelings about Black people. Similarly, Democrats are actually slightly more likely than Republicans to show high levels of this attitude.\\n\\nWe have no evidence that racism motivated ICE’s sterilization of immigrant women in detention. But those in government custody often appear to be the ones who are targeted. Given racial biases throughout the criminal justice system, people of color will likely be disproportionately affected – as has happened in Georgia.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/09/23/novel-proposal-help-millions-kids-struggling-with-online-school/', 'Full Text': 'Vikki Katz, an associate professor in the School of Communication and Information at Rutgers University, has a novel idea about how to get help to millions of students, which she writes about below. Katz is an expert on digital equity policy, immigrant families and educational inequality.\\n\\nBy Vikki Katz\\n\\nTo state the painfully obvious: We have just kicked off the bare-minimum school year. With the pandemic still uncontrolled and many school buildings lacking adequate ventilation systems to open at scale, even the students who most desperately need in-person instruction will not get nearly enough of it. Like Los Angeles Unified, many districts have prioritized having English learners and students in special education for in-person learning. However, because few districts can provide even these high-need groups of students with five days in the classroom, their parents will once again be obliged to manage remote learning.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRemote learning responsibilities have been a burden for parents of all backgrounds. For immigrant parents, who are less likely to have a high school diploma, have adequate Internet access and devices or feel less confident using these technologies than U.S.-born parents, the burden has been heavier still. For parents whose children are in overlapping categories, as both special education and English learners, the challenges are unmanageable.\\n\\nThe postscript on the sudden pivot to remote learning this past spring is a warning for the fall. Nationally, 1 in 3 K-12 students lacked sufficient Internet access, devices or both to complete remote learning successfully — and those numbers were even worse for children of immigrants. We cannot afford the same shortfalls this year when our most vulnerable students have already lost half a year of learning.\\n\\nHow do we slow months of learning loss before they become irrecoverable lost years? Already-overworked teachers cannot assume tech support responsibilities. Nor will immigrant parents; many are working multiple jobs and shifts that conflict with school hours. In many families, it will fall to older children to manage their siblings’ remote learning alongside their own, since they understand the technology, language and expectations of schools better than their parents do. These conditions will cascade educational inequities without an immediate intervention.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMy proposal: We must roll out a Digital Learning Ambassadors corps immediately, staffed by young adults in predominantly immigrant communities. Millions of young people, like my students at Rutgers University, are either completing remote coursework at home or graduated this past spring. They are looking for meaningful, paid work.\\n\\nAs tech-savvy, native speakers of languages spoken by the K-12 students who struggled most in remote learning this spring, they are our best untapped resource for supporting better learning experiences this fall.\\n\\nWith the pandemic disrupting normal patterns of operation for the foreseeable future, schools need to provide families with ongoing support. That means both technology maintenance and guidance on navigating online learning platforms, since most low-income immigrant parents seldom use computers for either work or personal reasons. Their limited familiarity with digital devices, with English, and with U.S. schooling compound one another in a remote environment.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA Digital Learning Ambassador who speaks the family’s language and can guide their connections to remote content and to teachers will address the needs of parents and students. Equally important, ambassadors will provide educators with urgently needed support as they manage incredible teaching challenges.\\n\\nA Digital Learning Ambassador corps need not be expensive and has precedent in national policy. When the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released its National Broadband Plan in 2010, it proposed a Digital Literacy Corps with the same principles outlined here but with a broader mandate of serving all local residents. The intervening decade provides many models that could be rapidly adapted to train Digital Learning Ambassadors.\\n\\nCities and regions can get started right away by using expanded allocations of Title I, youth employment and National Service Corps funds to hire and train Digital Learning Ambassadors in the 30 largest (and largely most diverse) school districts.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDrawing from proven and scaled service programs like Success Mentor Corps and City Year, Digital Learning Ambassadors will each “adopt” the number of families a district deems manageable and contact them twice each week. Ambassadors, trained to troubleshoot most family technology issues remotely, will elevate any issues requiring more serious attention to their supervisors. They can also flag content issues for teachers’ follow-up that parents may not be comfortable raising directly with teachers.\\n\\nDigital Learning Ambassadors need not be limited to English learners or students with special needs; every class of remote learners could benefit from such assistance. But if we must triage, then our districts should place the ambassadors where they can be of service to our most vulnerable students and families.

A recent Pew Research poll finds, “Overall, 44% of Americans now say that it is a lot more difficult to be a Black person in the U.S. than it is to be a White person, while 32% say it is a little more difficult and 23% say it is no more difficult. The share saying it is a lot more difficult to be Black than White is now 9 percentage points higher than it was in the summer of 2016.” (The increase, however, is almost entirely among Democrats, a sign that Trump’s racism and violent reaction to protesters have, if nothing else, prompted White Democrats to take a good look at racial injustice.)\\n\\nWe saw multiracial and multigenerational protests after George Floyd’s killing while in Minneapolis police custody last May. Marches and demonstrations took place in small rural towns, not just urban enclaves. This was a genuine and spontaneous outpouring of righteous indignation and empathy. Whether that was a fleeting emotion or it takes hold and provokes meaningful reforms depends in large part on the winner of November’s election. If current polling favoring Democrats holds, we will see the horrified response to police killings of African Americans reflected in the election results, and, we pray, in meaningful legislation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFrom the moment he came down his golden Trump Tower escalator in 2015 to announce his presidential run, Trump’s rhetoric and policy choices have demeaned and dehumanized immigrants. His association of immigrants with crime and his characterization of them as job-stealers hurting domestic workers (both factually wrong) had the potential to inflame the entire country. While anti-immigrant sentiment does bind Trump to his hardcore base, overall the country has become more inclusive — as hard as that is to imagine.\\n\\nThe recent Pew poll shows: “An increasing share of registered voters — Trump and Biden supporters alike — say the growing number of newcomers to the country strengthens American society. In the new survey, 60% say this, while 37% say this threatens the nation’s customs and values.” Four years ago, 50 percent said immigrants were more of a threat while 46 percent said they strengthened America. Remarkably, even Republicans have become more pro-immigrant:\\n\\nOnly about a third of Trump supporters (32%) say immigrants do more to strengthen society, but this is a 13 percentage point increase from 19% in 2016. Biden supporters are more likely than Clinton supporters four years ago to say the growing number of newcomers strengthens society (84% vs. 71%).\\n\\nDespite Trump’s Muslim travel ban, Islamophobia is also down. “Four years ago, a narrow majority (54%) of voters said that Islam was more likely than other religions to encourage violence among its followers,\" Pew found. “Today, the balance of opinion has shifted in the other direction, with 45% of voters saying that Islam is more likely to encourage violence and 51% saying it does not encourage violence more than other religions.” (These results may be attributable to the shift away from radical Islamic terrorist attacks and toward the much larger problem in the United States posed by white supremacists.)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump’s anti-immigrant initiatives, including the border wall (the amount of new wall construction has been minuscule, about five miles), repeal of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and attempts to punish so-called sanctuary cities, have largely failed. Trump’s odious child-separation policy at the southern border turned into a political nightmare for Republicans. In other words, Trump’s xenophobia has not sent the country into a downward spiral of hate against immigrants, nor will it leave a permanent legal legacy.\\n\\nReal progress in addressing racial justice and comprehensive immigration reform is possible next year — provided Trump and his Republican allies lose, and lose badly.

Based on Steinem’s memoir “My Life on the Road,” and directed by theater impressaria-turned-filmmaker Julie Taymor — who co-wrote the screenplay with Sarah Ruhl — this nontraditional biopic forgoes chronology for a collagelike storytelling that jumps backward and forward and backward again, covering Steinem’s itinerant childhood with her quirky father (played by Timothy Hutton), her two years living in India in her 20s, the founding of Ms. magazine and her work on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment (the subject of “Mrs. America”). In some ways, “The Glorias” is disappointingly straightforward, dutifully ticking off such milestones as Steinem’s illegal abortion, at 22, and her undercover stint as a Playboy Club bunny for a magazine exposé. But it’s at its best when Taymor is most theatrical, staging some scenes as elaborate fantasy, and regularly allowing the four actresses who play the protagonist at various ages — Ryan Kiera Armstrong, Lulu Wilson, Alicia Vikander and Julianne Moore — to converse with each other, not quite in character, from the inside of a bus traveling, metaphorically, through Steinem’s fascinating life.

Ilhan Omar (D), while spewing wretched nonsense about Joe Biden and refugees. The episode neatly captures the ailing state of Trumpist demagogic politics.\\n\\nBiden will “inundate your state with a historic flood of refugees,” Trump railed, insisting that “Biden and crazy Bernie Sanders have agreed on a manifesto” that pledged a “700 percent increase” in them.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump then unloaded on Omar — herself a refugee from Somalia — by baselessly suggesting she’d been implicated in voter fraud, unleashing a great roar of, “Lock her up!”\\n\\n“Then she tells us how to run our country,” Trump scoffed. “Can you believe it?”\\n\\nTrump’s substantive claim is silly. Yes, Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) agreed in their “unity task force” blueprint that Biden will seek to raise the cap on refugees the U.S. accepts to 125,000 per year. But that would only be a modest rise relative to 2017, when Trump took office and the official cap was 110,000.\\n\\nSince then Trump has dramatically slashed refugee levels — all the way down to 18,000 in 2020. The 700 percent increase would only be relative to that. If anything, restoring pre-Trump levels and building on them would be good policy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Trump’s claim that Omar “tells us how to run our country” deserves special attention. As Ronald Brownstein notes, by targeting a Muslim immigrant who is a naturalized citizen this way, Trump tells supporters that “people of color, big cities, liberals are interlopers” in “their White Christian America.”\\n\\nThe illegitimacy of the opposition\\n\\nIndeed, Trump’s core claim here is really that the opposition’s voters are simply not entitled to legitimate political representation.\\n\\nMore than 260,000 American citizens elected Omar to Congress in 2018 to represent them, to give themselves a voice in “how to run our country.” When Trump suggests Omar has no grounds to tell “us” how to do this, his real claim is that his supporters constitute “our” country, and that those who elected Omar don’t have a legitimate voice in running it because they don’t belong to that “us.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt’s often said that in 2016, Trump successfully tapped into a sense among many Midwestern voters that they’d been “forgotten” by our political classes, a sense that they lack political agency, which Trump addressed by making them feel heard and empowered. This core idea undergirds elite journalistic self-flagellation for having missed this sentiment in 2016.\\n\\nThere might be a good deal to that claim: Our political classes have failed a lot of people, and Biden appears to be working to speak to that sentiment among working-class whites, among whom he’s doing relatively well.\\n\\nBut Trump has perverted this whole sentiment into a concrete scheme to deny political agency and representation entirely to those who are outside of what he calls “our country.\"\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt’s no accident that Trump slides effortlessly between this line about Omar and his lies about voter fraud. They are two sides of the same coin: Trump is already working to delegitimize as many of the opposition’s legally cast ballots as possible as fraudulent. This would put the idea that they aren’t entitled to legitimate representation into operational practice, to maintain “our,” or his, America’s dominance via illicit means.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut this whole effort appears to be failing him, and not just because the anti-Trump majority outnumbers his lusty support base. Trump is losing the very voters this story is supposed to capture.\\n\\nTrump is losing Midwestern Whites\\n\\nIn a new analysis, Sabato’s Crystal Ball shifts Ohio and Iowa from the “Leans Republican” to the “Toss-Up” category. Trump carried them by eight and nine points in 2016.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe analysis also shifts Wisconsin to “Leans Democratic” and Minnesota to “Likely Democratic.” Trump won Wisconsin (and the other “blue wall” states of Pennsylvania and Michigan), and came within a hair of winning Minnesota.\\n\\nWhy is this happening? Partly because Biden is outperforming Hillary Clinton among White voters:\\n\\nNamely, after Clinton hemorrhaged white voters in northern small town and rural areas in 2016, Biden appears to be bringing some of those voters back into the Democratic fold while also improving on Clinton’s margins with white suburbanites. If this pattern holds in the actual results, it could pay major dividends for Biden in the Great Lakes region, where American presidential elections are so often won and lost and where the electorates in the competitive states are whiter than the nation as a whole.\\n\\nTrump spent months on a “law and order” strategy to galvanize his core White supporters while frightening White suburbanites back to him. That failed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThen, at the debate, Trump kept it up, falsely insisting Biden wouldn’t utter the words “law and order,” winking to right-wing extremists and white supremacists, and again rallying supporters to intimidate the opposition’s voters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYet Republicans believe this is failing for him, reports the New York Times.

And the anniversary of 9/11 should drive this home.\\n\\nTrump’s elite policy catastrophe\\n\\nTrump is now presiding over his own form of massive elite policy failure, one that has killed more Americans than 9/11 and the militarized overreaction to it many times over. Just like the Iraq War, it, too, was initially sold and is getting covered up with unrestrained official propagandizing and lying.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMeanwhile, some of the very worst abuses and pathologies of the Trump presidency represent continuations of our overreaction to 9/11. He has exacerbated the Islamophobia it helped unleash to an extraordinarily explicit degree, and he has politically weaponized the post-9/11 homeland security bureaucracy in just the way its initial critics feared.\\n\\nWe saw this when Trump endorsed a virulently Islamophobic congressional candidate, only the latest example in his long history of open anti-Islamic bigotry. And we’re seeing this now with extraordinary abuses at the Department of Homeland Security, which was birthed amid the post-9/11 climate of fear. While it committed serious abuses under former president Barack Obama, it has now been corrupted by Trump and his cabal in just about every conceivable way.\\n\\nThis goes far beyond immigration. We just learned from a DHS whistleblower that top officials appear to have manipulated intelligence to help fabricate the existence of an organized leftist domestic terror threat for Trump to run for reelection against. That comes after DHS sent armies of law enforcement into urban protest zones to provoke the civil conflict that Trump believes will boost that case.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAll this rank Islamophobia and all this corrupt weaponization of DHS to target domestic dissidents and help manufacture Trump’s reelection agitprop are in many ways crucial aspects of our national 9/11 legacy. They will not be discussed at Friday’s commemorations.\\n\\nTrump’s tale about Biden\\n\\nJoe Biden, too, represents aspects of these post-9/11 failures. He supported the Iraq War, and he was a supporter of opening up China to trade, though the story there is complicated.\\n\\nTrump is using these facts to continue casting Biden as a member of that failed, corrupt, militaristic, globalist post-9/11 elite, and himself as their scourge. When military officials leaked that Trump called our war dead “losers,” he positioned himself as an opponent of the military-industrial complex’s war lust.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Trump cannot credibly tell this story. His trade wars with China are a disaster. He spent weeks covering for China’s coronavirus failures to sustain the lie that he had it mastered here. Biden, not Trump, is proposing concrete policies for rebuilding U.S. manufacturing.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBiden’s balance on China — build international coalitions to confront unfair trade practices while seeking cooperation on climate change and global pandemics — will prove far better. As a terrific New York Times piece chronicled, his approach is rooted in learning from his long and complex series of interactions with China, which included much good and bad. Trump cannot learn.\\n\\nWhat’s more, Trump did not actually oppose the Iraq War. And the Trumpist vow to undo our post-9/11 militaristic excesses has always been mostly nonsense — he regularly boasts of building up the military and even talks about maximal weapons sales abroad as good business for the United States, which it has long been.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd while Biden’s brand of hawkish liberal internationalism badly needs a rethink, we are now seeing Trump’s own supposed hostility to hyper-militarization morph into hideous domestic abuses of the national security state right before our eyes.\\n\\nTrump’s mythos has fallen apart\\n\\nAbove all, Trump is responsible for the most catastrophic elite policy failure of the modern era.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen we learned Trump privately knew the airborne coronavirus threat was far deadlier than he publicly allowed — and that he admitted to publicly downplaying it — it exposed his disastrous mishandling of the pandemic in a new way.\\n\\nWhen this is understood as exactly the sort of massive elite policy disaster — buttressed by extraordinary willful deception and deeply depraved unconcern for the lives of untold Americans — that the Trump mythos created as his foil, that mythos implodes further.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs the nearly 200,000 deaths help illustrate, Trump and his cronies and GOP enablers constitute a stupider, more corrupt, more incompetent, more dishonest and more depraved elite than even the caricature version of pre-Trump elites he created as a foil to gain power.

In the 2015 speech that launched his presidential campaign, Trump called Mexican immigrants “rapists” and drug dealers. In the years following his election, images of immigrant children in overcrowded detention centers dominated the news. The coronavirus pandemic has disproportionately affected and killed people in the Latino community.\\n\\nYet many of his Latino supporters in the Copper State, overwhelmingly of Mexican descent, point to Trump’s business-oriented policies, such as lowering taxes and lifting regulations, as more consequential actions that, they say, have benefited wages and employment levels in their communities. This, along with religious conservatism — particularly antiabortion stances — are the reasons they want to see him reelected.\\n\\nThe rationale illuminates the different ways Latinos, predicted to become the largest group of non-White voters, are impelled to cast their vote based on factors that vary from state to state and reflect local dynamics. Although a majority of the group has traditionally supported Democrats, some Latino voters say they now find more common ground with Republican principles, challenging the notion of a monolithic voting bloc.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It infuriates me that the government puts me in a box and calls me a Latino or a Hispanic or minority female,” Saucedo said. “It doesn’t work for me, because I am no different than other Americans in terms of the things that interest me: to be able to put food on my table, to have a job.”\\n\\n“Most Latinos here, we are all in the same boat, especially the ones coming from Mexico like me,” Saucedo said. “We are luchadores, entrepreneurs, we fight for what we want. We just want to be left alone, and the government to let markets flow.”\\n\\nThe pragmatic logic behind the vote is simple, according to Reymundo Torres, a Mexican American Trump supporter and president of the Arizona Latino Republican Association. Latino entrepreneurs have much to gain from a “free, robust economy,” he said, governed by lower taxes and fiscal responsibility.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHigher taxes, generally viewed as a liberal policy, would hurt more than 3.3 million Hispanic-owned businesses in Arizona, he said.\\n\\nSome residents such as Torres live in border states heavily dependent on trade with Mexico. They see the signing of the free trade agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada, negotiated under Trump, as beneficial for the local economy and crucial for the post-coronavirus recovery of jobs and wages.\\n\\nBut it’s more than just economic issues driving some Latinos to Trump. Rudolfo Peña, a 68-year-old registered Democrat and self-employed construction worker from Phoenix, said he witnessed the party’s gradual shift further to the left as he grew older. It was the party’s stance on abortion that first made him question his own political views.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt was Trump’s “willingness to fight back” against the political establishment, the media and the Democratic leadership, he said, that won him over. He will vote for Trump again Nov. 3.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It was what we were waiting for, literally for decades,” Peña said.\\n\\nRepublican Latinos who spoke to The Washington Post argued that the excessive bureaucracy of liberal policies gets in the way of the Latino entrepreneurial spirit.\\n\\n“I just don’t want to have to jump through so many hoops and endless paperwork to be able to make a living while Democrats willingly prefer to help those who don’t follow the rules,” Peña said.\\n\\nAlthough Latinos remain a key constituency for the Democratic Party, their vote has fluctuated over the years. In 2004, George W. Bush secured a significant 44 percent of the Latino vote. Then the pendulum swung back in Democrats’ favor in 2012, when President Barack Obama took 71 percent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the enthusiasm for Democrats has wavered since: Hillary Clinton won 66 percent in 2016, compared with Trump’s 28 percent, according to network exit polls in 2016. In the run-up to the 2020 election, a Fox News poll published in the past week showed more Latino support for Trump than four years ago, with 57 percent supporting Biden and 41 percent supporting Trump.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStrategists and advocacy groups say the recent shift away from Democrats correlates with low levels of outreach in Latino and Hispanic communities from both parties.\\n\\n“For a long time Democrats have taken Latinos for granted, and Republicans have ignored them,” said Clarissa Martínez de Castro, vice president of UnidosUS, a Latino advocacy group.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMartinez said the limited effort in both parties to court Latino voters is surprising considering the high level of Latino turnout in past elections.\\n\\n“The word that best describes the outreach to Latinos is ‘anemic,’ ” she said. “That is why many of them remain unconvinced.”\\n\\nBut with a record 32 million eligible Latino and Hispanic voters, both campaigns are ramping up efforts to boost turnout and rally voters.\\n\\nAt a Latinos for Trump roundtable in Phoenix in the past week, Trump said “Hispanic Americans embody the American Dream” and reiterated his administration’s “unwavering devotion” to the community.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“You uplift our communities and promote our shared values of faith, family, community, hard work and patriotism,” Trump told a cheering crowd.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn Arizona, where Latinos make up about 24 percent of eligible voters, the political pendulum seems to be swinging to the left. Recent local and national polls show Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and Senate candidate Mark Kelly (D) leading in tight races, raising Democrats’ hopes to flip the state and ultimately determine the election in November.\\n\\nA Post-ABC News poll released Wednesday shows Biden with the support of 49 percent of registered voters in Arizona vs. 47 percent for Trump, a difference that is within the poll’s margin of sampling error. In that poll, Biden’s 61 percent support among Latino voters is identical Clinton’s support in 2016.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe growth of the Latino population, an influx of more Democrats from California, and mobilization can help explain the political shift, experts say.\\n\\n“The state is changing, and it is manifesting in various ways,” said Rodney Hero, a professor of political science at Arizona State University.\\n\\nHero said that wages and the economy remain top priorities among Latinos in Arizona. Also high on the list: health care, amid a pandemic which has disproportionately affected minorities and has left millions without jobs.\\n\\nBut residents such as Saucedo feel the Democratic Party has done little more than paid lip service to Latino voters for years.\\n\\n“Democrats tell Latinos that they are their best choice,” Saucedo said. “But when it comes to needing their help, they do not help you. All they want is your vote, all they want is you as a victim.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMany Latinos have been outraged by Trump’s clampdown on illegal immigration, his legal battles against the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and the massive deportation of central American immigrants. But for some Latino hard-liners in Arizona, including Saucedo, those issues are an afterthought. Instead, they are focused on Trump’s “law and order” message.\\n\\n“I am a responsible adult, I came here legally without breaking any rules. The opportunities are there,” Saucedo said. “There is no excuse for anyone to take advantage of the system.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/restaurants/peking-duck-restaurants/2020/10/06/0a7c809c-04fc-11eb-a2db-417cddf4816a_story.html', 'Full Text': \"For a price, you are dropped into another world, where you become someone who’s waited on like a member of the landed aristocracy, even if you’re a middle-class grinder like me. This experience is largely what we are missing during the pandemic with restaurants: the ability to escape our gnarly existence for a couple of magnificent hours.\\n\\nI was reminded of this recently when, out of nowhere, I had a desire for Peking duck. I’m not trying to compare Duck Chang’s (4427 John Marr Dr., Annandale. 703-941-9400; duckchangs.com), a 45-year-old strip-center institution in Northern Virginia, with the Inn at Little Washington. Yet, there’s no denying the drama of a server working the sharp edge of duck slicer to break down a lacquered bird at the table: It’s one of those rare moments when you get to witness knife technique inside a restaurant.\\n\\nBut more than that, the ritual is a link to the past, to Chinese imperial kitchens, where Peking duck was created and where the knowledge of its preparation and carving began to spread to common restaurants. From there, the techniques were handed down from one generation to another and another, over centuries, until they finally arrived at your table in the D.C. suburbs.\\n\\nPeter Chang (no, not that one) is the second-generation proprietor of Duck Chang’s, the place his father, Man Ming Chang, debuted in 1975 after establishing his reputation at several Washington restaurants. Man Ming first learned his trade at his family's restaurant in northern China, but when the communists took control of Beijing, he fled to Hong Kong and then to Thailand, where he would become the chief banquet chef to King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Man Ming later immigrated to the United States to work at The Empress, Imperial Garden and China Gate, Peter Chang tells me. It was within these kitchens that he earned the nickname “Duck” Chang.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Chang himself brings the fowl directly from the oven to the guest — it looks beautiful, almost as though it were varnished — and carves it himself,” wrote Donald Dresden in a 1976 review of Duck Chang’s for The Washington Post.\\n\\n“He wields a murderously sharp knife with such dexterous speed that the crisp, brown skin and the underlying meat are hot when served, rolled up in a thin Mandarin crepelike pancake with plum sauce and scallions. Delicious,” Dresden continued. “No wonder the chef is called ‘Duck.’”\\n\\nThese days, no one is wielding a sharp knife tableside at Duck Chang’s. Not Duck Chang (who died in 2005 at age 81). Not Duck Chang Jr., eldest son of the founder and brother to Peter (Junior recently suffered his third heart attack, Peter said). And not Peter or even Peter’s son, Kinlon, a student at George Mason University who occasionally helps at the restaurant. That’s because Duck Chang’s hasn’t reopened its small dining room. It’s apparently not worth the costs to run it.\\n\\nBut you can still order Peking duck to go. Plenty of folks do. About 20 ducks are packaged for takeaway each day, Peter says, down about 50 percent from weekday orders before the pandemic, and far below the weekend average of 100-plus birds. When you untie the plastic bag — or, more likely, just rip it open for quick access — you might think the staff was in a hurry to get that duck out the door. My order was stuffed into Chinese takeaway cartons, one for the meat and bones, another for the skin. The containers were unsealed, their flaps flying in the breeze. When I prepared my first pancake, I soon realized why: The skin had not steamed on itself. It was still shatteringly crisp, playing the perfect foil to that moist duck meat.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe open-box trick is one that Peter — who studied molecular genetics at George Mason — learned well before the pandemic. “But you got to start with a crispy duck in order for the duck to keep crispy,” he warns me.\\n\\nMy favorite duck carver in the area retired a couple of years ago. When I first met Wang Wen Fang at China Wok (8395 Leesburg Pike, Tysons. 703-893-4488; chinawokviennava.com), he was 83 and still carving ducks with the dexterity of a man 50 years his junior. With a pinstriped fedora snugly covering his head, Wang was an almost daily presence at the restaurant, a sign of stability in a world with so little of it. He’s 90 now, co-owner Vera Ho tells me, and his health is good, despite a virus that has decimated countless lives across the globe.\\n\\n“I cannot open the dining room because I’m scared of the virus,” Ho says. But you can still get China Wok’s superb Peking duck to go, its meat and bones placed at the bottom of a plastic container and covered with foil, on top of which rests the skin. The duck travels well, too, though I feel sorry for diners who will never experience the full effect of Wang’s carvings. It was like watching a great athlete in his prime, witnessing how fluid the knife moves in his hand, as graceful and powerful as a Michael Jordan with a basketball.\\n\\nWang honed his skills at Peking Gourmet Inn (6029 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church. 703-671-8088; pekinggourmet.com), the standard-bearer for Peking duck in the region and one of the late George H.W. Bush’s favorite haunts. Peking Gourmet is one of the few places where you can still get dinner and a show at your table. In rooms decorated with framed portraits of politicians, generals, vice admirals, movie stars and others celebrities, you can have a close encounter with a famous duck carved right before you eyes, its meat and skin fanned out on oval plates branded with Peking Gourmet Inn.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOpened in 1978, Peking Gourmet was born in an era when immigrant restaurateurs were invested in assimilation. The establishment has given over its walls to dozens of photos, each a testimonial to the widespread popularity of the place. As I sit under a picture of retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, who shows off his dimples in a smiling portrait with second-generation owner George Tsui, I’m beaming myself as my masked server starts to carve the duck, carefully scraping fat from skin. She tells me her name is Linda. She’s Latinx, one of countless carvers who have trained for weeks in the kitchen before taking their place on the dining room floor. She represents the past and future of Peking duck, and right now, I sense both of us are just thinking about the present — and how to enjoy the moment from a safe distance.\"}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/11/trump-might-want-stop-fighting-culture-wars-hes-losing/', 'Full Text': 'When it comes to serenity in the suburbs and elsewhere, polls show that he trails Democratic nominee Joe Biden. In a Morning Consult-Politico survey, Biden leads 47 percent to 39 percent on who voters trust when it comes to public safety. Fifty percent of likely voters in a recent Quinnipiac poll said Trump made them feel less safe, 10 percentage points higher than said the same of Biden. Last week’s ABC News-Ipsos poll found 55 percent think Trump is making civil unrest worse, while only 13 percent said he is calming the situation. Biden’s polling in Wisconsin, where recent police clashes and the killing of two protesters followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake, remains strong. Chalk up a win for Biden, then, on the “law and order” issue.\\n\\nOther aspects of the culture wars are not going any better for Trump. A Post poll found that “a majority of Americans, including a majority of football fans, says it is acceptable for professional athletes to kneel during the national anthem, and an even larger percentage say athletes should use their platforms to tackle social issues.” It is not even close. “Despite cries for athletes to ‘stick to sports,’ particularly from conservative pundits and politicians, a 62 percent majority of Americans say professional athletes should use their platforms to express their views on national issues.” Trump strongly opposes protests by athletes and, at one point, called them “sons of b-----s” for kneeling during the national anthem.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMoreover, as Biden has argued, the American people’s eyes have been opened by the series of police shootings of unarmed Black men and women, especially the Memorial Day killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which set off nationwide Black Lives Matter protests. The Post reports: “Six in 10 Americans say recent killings of Black people by police are a sign of broader problems in the treatment of Black people by police, according to the poll, while 36 percent say they are isolated incidents.” In other words, a supermajority of Americans think there is systemic racism, but Trump and his acolytes — despite a mound of evidence — think Whites are the real victims in American society.\\n\\nOn racial justice issues, there are large disparities by party and race, but even within the Republican Party there are not-insignificant segments that recognize systemic racism (33 percent) and favor athletes’ protests (36 percent) and use of their platform for social change (43 percent). In a warning sign for Republicans, large percentages of suburban voters and White, college-educated voters, two highly sought-after segments of the electorate slipping away from Republicans, believe racism is more than a series of discrete instances and favor protests and athletes’ use of their platforms to call for change.\\n\\nFinally, on immigration, the voters have become more supportive of newcomers during the Trump years. Polling from the Pew Research Center finds that “an increasing share of registered voters — Trump and Biden supporters alike — say the growing number of newcomers to the country strengthens American society. In the new survey, 60% say this, while 37% say this threaten the nation’s customs and values.” That is an improvement since 2016, when the split was 50 percent to 46 percent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn short, Trump’s racist, anti-immigrant outlook and his hostility toward police reforms and activism for racial justice reflect a majority of Republicans by many measures. However, as voters overall flee the Republican Party (which is down 8 percent in affiliation this year alone, while Democrats have gained 5 percent) and the country becomes more diverse, Trump’s nationalist party has become more isolated from the majority of Americans.\\n\\nIn comparison to Trump, the majority of Americans are far more inclusive, more open-minded about the tenacity of racism and more supportive of athletes playing a role in social change. Culture wars might be Trump’s favorite ploy, but he is playing a losing hand.\\n\\nWatch Opinions videos:\\n\\nRead more:'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/10/08/cruelty-was-always-point-lies-standard-procedure/', 'Full Text': 'The depravity of the policy was captured by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, as the New York Times reported on Tuesday night. Despite repeated public denials that the Justice Department had directed the policy, Horowitz learned that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions had made clear during a May 2018 conference call with U.S. attorneys that President Trump wanted a “zero tolerance” family separation policy. “We need to take away children,” Sessions reportedly said. One of the attorneys on the call put it down in notes: “If care about kids, don’t bring them in. Won’t give amnesty to people with kids.” The Times also reported: “Rod J. Rosenstein, then the deputy attorney general, went even further in a second call about a week later, telling the five prosecutors that it did not matter how young the children were. He said that government lawyers should not have refused to prosecute two cases simply because the children were barely more than infants.”\\n\\nThere’s also this passage from the Times’s reporting, reminiscent of so many cases of human rights abuse around the globe: “Gene Hamilton, a top lawyer and ally of Stephen Miller, the architect of the president’s assault on immigration, argued in a 32-page response that Justice Department officials merely took direction from the president.” Just following orders. If anyone in the administration bothered to pick up a history book, they might have figured out that it would have been better to quit than to carry out such immoral policies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden reacted as many Americans would — with horror and anger:\\n\\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, also released a blistering statement: “The active participation of senior Department of Justice officials — including the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General — in President Trump’s plan to deliberately and callously tear apart immigrant families is another degradation of the Department,\" he declared. \"The months-long delay in the release of the Inspector General’s final report, perhaps until after the election, suggests a Department still running political errands for the president. The American people need a full accounting of the damage this President has inflicted on our system of justice.”\\n\\nHorowitz’s revelations leave the impression that Sessions and Rosenstein were not only cruel but also cowardly. If they believed in the policy, why not claim ownership? Why deny there was a policy or shift blame to the Department of Homeland Security?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMatthew Miller, a former Justice Department spokesman, tells me, “This report shows a complete lack of any moral leadership at the senior levels of the department. Even now, Rod Rosenstein is hiding behind a flimsy bureaucratic excuse to justify his role in a policy that was pure evil.” Miller adds, “The stain left by this horrific policy should follow everyone involved for the rest of their lives.”\\n\\nOn one level, this discovery is just another piece of the picture of a Justice Department that has lost its way. Overrun by ideologues and lacking the professional and moral spine to push back on orders that undermined the rule of law, too many lawyers cooperated with or failed to ring the alarm as Sessions, Rosenstein and later Attorney General William P. Barr (who further politicized the Justice Department in spinning the Mueller report and intervening in the Roger Stone and Michael Flynn cases) misrepresented their work, acted as the president’s private attorney and refused to uphold the finest traditions of the department.\\n\\nFormer federal prosecutor Joyce White Vance observes, “The IG’s report is a shocking reminder that DOJ lost its way long before Bill Barr took over as AG.” She adds, “The Justice Department is the only Cabinet level agency whose name is a moral virtue. Trump’s Justice Department failed to live up to it.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Justice Department is going to need a top-to-bottom evaluation to see what, if any, laws were broken in this or other matters (including lies under oath to courts or Congress), what department procedures were broken and what professional responsibilities were ignored. Those who have brought disrepute on the department need to be fired, and, if warranted, an accounting of their actions should be submitted to state bar authorities for disciplinary action.\\n\\nIf elected, Biden will need an attorney general willing to take this on, mete out appropriate discipline and then rebuild the Justice Department’s reputation.

But that article recounts Biden saying he would support allowing undocumented immigrants access to health care. (The Biden campaign has a policy position that undocumented immigrants should be able to purchase insurance on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, but without receiving any subsidies.) In other words, it was not about Social Security.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nApparently, the ad is supposed to address a different point — that Biden proposes a pathway to citizenship for an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants, and thus eventually they would be eligible to get Social Security.\\n\\nThe Facts\\n\\nFirst, let’s look at the misleading clip. Here, the Trump campaign is borrowing a talking point from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and his supporters. But the complaint lacks context — and is odd, coming from a Republican.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the mid-1980s, bipartisan alarm grew over soaring federal budget deficits under President Ronald Reagan. Biden, working with Sens. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.) and Max Baucus (D-Mont.), proposed a simple solution: a one-year freeze on all spending, including defense spending and social programs such as Social Security.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBiden pitched it as the “last best chance” to keep deficits from undermining the economic recovery and dropping the country into another recession. He also said it would avoid having to “make other significant changes in Medicare and significant changes in Social Security generally.” The plan was rejected 33 to 65, though more Democrats than Republicans voted for it.\\n\\nThe Trump ad takes a clip of Biden speaking on the Senate floor in 1995, recalling that fight at a time when Republicans had taken control of the House and Senate and were pressing for passage of a balanced-budget amendment. But the ad misleadingly edits the clip to remove the context that Biden called for a freeze on all federal spending, not just Social Security and Medicare. Here’s Biden’s full statement, with quotes in the ad signified in bold.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once. I tried it twice. I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnder our guide to manipulated video, this type of deceptive editing is known as omission.\\n\\nWhat’s the evidence for “Biden's promising your benefits to illegal immigrants?” It’s pretty technical — and slim. It also involves a bit of ancient history.\\n\\nPeople only earn Social Security benefits if they pay into the system. (Social Security is designed to provide workers with a basic level of income in retirement, as well as disability pay and life insurance while they work.)\\n\\nThe benefits are progressive, meaning lower-income workers get a relatively better deal than higher-income workers; however, workers making above a certain salary ($137,700 in 2020) don’t have to pay as much of their income into the system, though their benefits are capped, too. The benefits are inflation-adjusted after initial receipt, a feature that is almost impossible to find in the U.S. annuity market.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe suggestion that some other worker, let alone illegal immigrants, can receive “your benefits” is simply wrong. Your benefits are established under the law, depending how long you have worked and for how much. Maybe the ad means “the same benefits,” but as phrased it is misleading.\\n\\nBiden has called for a path for citizenship for some 11 million undocumented immigrants — a standard position for a Democrat. If these people ever become citizens, they too would be eligible to earn Social Security benefits.\\n\\nUndocumented workers currently are not eligible for Social Security. Yet with few exceptions, workers in the United States must pay a portion of their earnings to Social Security, which is matched by their employer. Thus workers in the country illegally who have fraudulent or unauthorized Social Security numbers are paying into the system but do not get any benefits.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUntil the law was changed in 2008, the Social Security Administration would process claims for credit for those payments in benefit calculations if a formerly illegal immigrant became a legal resident — and the worker could prove he or she had made payments to the Social Security system.\\n\\nWhen this issue was being debated in the Senate in 2006 and 2007, Biden voted to kill the amendment banning the policy once, voted against a procedural motion to block it another time and then was absent the day it was added to a spending bill. In 2013, Biden described it as “just mean” that “even if you’ve been working and paying into Social Security once you come out of the shadows and you are on the path to citizenship you don’t get credit for all the money you paid to the government.”\\n\\nAs a candidate, Biden does not appear to have taken a position on this issue. So there is not much of a “promise” that can be found.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Trump campaign also points to Biden’s support for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, established under Obama for the so-called Dreamers — undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. After paying taxes for 10 years, like all other Social Security taxpayers, the Obama White House said, Dreamers would become eligible for Social Security. The Social Security actuary determined that the long-term actuarial balance of the Social Security Trust Funds would be “improved slightly” because of the additional payroll taxes paid by DACA workers. (Trump has sought to terminate DACA.)\\n\\n“Joe Biden has not put forward a policy that entitles undocumented immigrants to Social Security benefits,” a Biden campaign aide said. “Joe Biden is in support of helping families stay together by providing a road map to citizenship for undocumented immigrants in our nation. American citizens are entitled to accessing Social Security benefits that they have already paid into.”\\n\\n“There is no question that Joe Biden has openly pledged to provide government benefits to illegal immigrants, including student loans and access to his government-run health plan,” Ali Pardo, the Trump campaign’s deputy communications director, said in an emailed statement. “Social Security is no different. Biden supports reinstituting the unconstitutional DACA and DAPA programs, which Social Security’s Chief Actuary and the Obama White House said would make illegal immigrants eligible for Social Security. Unlike Biden, President Trump will always protect Social Security and the seniors who rely on it.”\\n\\nThe Pinocchio Test\\n\\nOverall, the ad is confusing. It never mentions Biden’s support of a pathway to citizenship and cites a news article about another issue, but supposedly that’s the message. We suspect the Trump campaign was trying to shoehorn illegal immigration into an attack on Biden’s Social Security record but did not quite pull it off.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOnce undocumented immigrants become U.S. citizens or permanent residents, under the law, they eventually will be eligible to earn Social Security. Dreamers covered under DACA were also allowed to become eligible, which the Social Security actuary said would improve the long-term financial health of the program, allowing it to continue to pay full benefits. Technically, DACA recipients are still in the United States illegally, though most solutions to the issue envision a path to citizenship for people who came to here as children.\\n\\nThe Trump ad takes an old Biden clip out of context. That’s strike one.\\n\\nThen it claims Biden has promised something — but there is no such promise. That’s strike two.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFinally, it falsely suggests illegal immigrants will receive “your” Social Security benefits. With the narrow exception of DACA recipients, they would not receive the same benefits until they become legal.

But the alternative, the movie suggests, is kind of horrifying in a different way: She falls in with a group of fellow 11-year-olds who are working on a hypersexualized dance routine so they can enter a dance competition. They get their ideas from the Internet, learning to twerk and gyrate and simulate sex acts.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt’s sick. It’s grotesque. You feel, for lack of a better word, ick watching it.\\n\\nBut that’s the point. When the girls are watching hardcore porn on one of their smartphones and discussing degrading sex acts, you’re supposed to be angry that this is the world we’ve given our children. When one of the girls picks up a used condom on the street and blows it up like a balloon, resulting in the other girls washing her mouth out with soap as they scream about her dying from cancer and AIDS, you’re supposed to be furious that our children live in a world where perverts discard used prophylactics in public places.\\n\\nAnd when you see them dance, you are supposed to react as the older characters in this movie react: with revulsion.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnfortunately, writer-director Maïmouna Doucouré undermines the point she’s trying to make by shooting the revolting dance routines too well. The result is scenes that are a little too loving and not nearly horrified enough. In a way, this whole thing serves as a minor rebuke to the idea of the concept of the male gaze: If you shoot anything of this sort with care, it’s going to end up looking lustful. The camera is hungry. The camera wants to show us too much.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt doesn’t help that the conclusion of “Cuties” is too pat. None of the girls is ever made unsafe by their behavior. There’s nothing that pushes Amy away from overt sexualization and to something more wholesome. She just … winds up there. It’s as unsatisfying dramatically as it is thematically. And Netflix shot itself in the foot with its marketing, which made the movie look like a clone of the “Step Up” series with age-inappropriate stars.\\n\\nWhich is to say that I largely agree with Rod Dreher, who wrote that the movie “engages and demonstrates with great passion the very thing it purports to condemn.” What I disagree with are the people on social media and elsewhere who are condemning this movie as “kiddie porn” (it isn’t, as squicky as it is) or prurient for prurience’s sake.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCritics and commentators convinced this is nothing more than QAnon-inflected panic-mongering should get out of their bubble: Folks are right to be concerned about the sexualization of children even in the service of condemning such sexualization. Conservatives sitting there screaming “We don’t need to be shown that pop culture and pornography are bad, everyone knows it’s bad” should consider that they’re not the target audience: Some people do need a reminder.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut for this movie to work as critique, those who have championed “Cuties” need to ask what we have to do as a society to ensure our children don’t feel pressured to act this way. Did you, dear reader, celebrate the raunchy vulgarity of Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s “WAP” or dismiss criticism of it as fuddy-duddiness? Have you shrugged away the fact that Kim Kardashian made the leap from sex tape to mogul? Do you think it’s okay to celebrate little kids partaking in drag shows where grown-ups throw dollars bills at them?\\n\\nHave you considered that you have helped create the world that “Cuties” is critiquing?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf you’re horrified by what you see in this movie — if you take it seriously as a critique — then work to change the world we’ve made. Otherwise you’re simply proving the movie’s angriest critics right.\\n\\nWatch Opinions videos:'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/amy-coney-barrett-and-the-gops-hypocrisy-about-religion/2020/09/27/15fac350-00d0-11eb-897d-3a6201d6643f_story.html', 'Full Text': 'To divert attention from Barrett’s views and their wanton flouting of historical norms, her Republican defenders offered dire warnings about a coming religious war. They insisted that anyone who expressed interest in how the 7th Circuit jurist’s Catholic faith or her membership in a fellowship called People of Praise might affect her view of the issues facing the court was guilty of “anti-Catholic bigotry,” as Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) put it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSasse was echoing many others on the right. Vice President Pence said questions about Barrett’s religious views were evidence of “intolerance . . . about her Catholic faith.”\\n\\nThe idea seems to be that if a public figure such as Barrett speaks openly about the importance of her faith, as she does, no one has any right to comment or inquire about what this means for her attitudes toward public questions.\\n\\nA small problem with all the Republican huffing and puffing: The GOP and its conservative loyalists assail the faiths of their political opponents all the time.\\n\\nIt wasn’t the American Civil Liberties Union or some other bastion of liberalism that questioned Joe Biden’s Catholic faith. No, it was a speaker at this year’s GOP convention, former Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz, who called Biden a Catholic “in name only” because of Biden’s support for abortion rights. A conservative group called CatholicVote is spending $9.7 million in Michigan, Pennsylvania and other battleground states attacking the devout Biden as an “existential threat” to the church.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd Trump himself rather astonishingly declared that Biden would “hurt God,” and “hurt the Bible,” too. I didn’t hear Pence say anything about Trump’s “intolerance” toward Biden’s faith. (And speaking of bigotry, we can’t forget Trump’s banning citizens from a group of predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States)\\n\\nThis is yet another case of the “heads we win, tails you lose” bullying Republicans have turned into high art. They ask us to accept that the only kind of faith that can never be questioned is the sort that leads people to support conservative policies and vote for Republican candidates. When it comes to other brands of faith (and especially to nonbelievers), it’s open season.\\n\\nAre liberals sometimes clueless about conservative believers? Sure. I wish Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) had never said to Barrett at her confirmation hearing for the appeals court: “The dogma lives loudly within you, and that’s of concern.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBeyond how weird that statement is, it had an illiberal sweep to it — and in any event, we are not worried about Barrett’s “dogma.” (The Virgin Birth? The Resurrection?) What we have good reason to worry about, as my colleague Ruth Marcus wrote, is Barrett’s rather radical lack of respect for court precedents.\\n\\nStill, I would insist that far from being a sign of “bigotry,” invitations to public figures to explain how their faith influences their ethical and political views is a sign of respect and of taking faith seriously.\\n\\nReligious conservatives have every right to bring their faith-inflected views to the public square. (I freely acknowledge that my own commitments on poverty and social justice have been much influenced by Catholic social thought.) But once we enter the fray, others have an equal right to challenge our assumptions and ideas. That’s how democratic dialogue works.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat degrades religion to the level of political propaganda is conservative double-talk that it’s okay for them to criticize Biden’s brand of Catholicism, but not okay for liberals to challenge Barrett’s brand of Catholicism.\\n\\nAs a practical matter. I hope Democrats stay away from Barrett’s faith altogether. The central issue is not Barrett herself but the scandal of Trump making this nomination 38 days before the election. Republicans have proved themselves to be ethical and constitutional opportunists by having different rules for Supreme Court nominations by Democratic and Republican presidents.\\n\\nBarrett must be pressed to reveal exactly what she discussed with Trump — and to recuse herself from any case involving the 2020 election. Trump has already signaled that he is counting on a new justice to help him steal the election. “We need nine justices,” he explained to reporters, because of “a hoax with the ballots.” He has made any conversation with Barrett, any winks and nods, public issues.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDemocrats must also challenge Barrett on the Affordable Care Act, which, based on her record, she might well gut, and also on her very troubling rulings on worker, immigrant and civil rights.\\n\\nThere’s one other reason to stay away from Barrett’s faith. Republicans desperately want to keep it front and center so their theatrical ranting about “anti-Catholicism” will drown out the real issue: their unconscionable, boundless and unprincipled lust for judicial power.\\n\\nRead more:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-race-record/2020/09/23/332b0b68-f10f-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html', 'Full Text': 'Trump’s private musings about Hispanics match the vitriol he has displayed in public, and his antipathy to Africa is so ingrained that when first lady Melania Trump planned a 2018 trip to that continent he railed that he “could never understand why she would want to go there.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen challenged on these views by subordinates, Trump has invariably responded with indignation. “He would say, ‘No one loves Black people more than me,’ ” a former senior White House official said. The protests rang hollow because if the president were truly guided by such sentiments he “wouldn’t need to say it,” the official said. “You let your actions speak.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn Trump’s case, there is now a substantial record of his actions as president that have compounded the perceptions of racism created by his words.\\n\\nOver 3½ years in office, he has presided over a sweeping U.S. government retreat from the front lines of civil rights, endangering decades of progress against voter suppression, housing discrimination and police misconduct.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHis immigration policies hark back to quota systems of the 1920s that were influenced by the junk science of eugenics, and have involved enforcement practices — including the separation of small children from their families — that seemed designed to maximize trauma on Hispanic migrants.\\n\\nWith the election looming, the signaling behind even second-tier policy initiatives has been unambiguous.\\n\\nAfter rolling back regulations designed to encourage affordable housing for minorities, Trump declared himself the champion of the “Suburban Lifestyle Dream.” He ordered aides to revamp racial sensitivity training at federal agencies so that it no longer refers to “White privilege.” In a speech at the National Archives on Thursday, Trump vowed to overhaul what children are taught in the nation’s schools — something only states have the power to do — while falsely claiming that students are being “fed lies about America being a wicked nation plagued by racism.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe America envisioned by these policies and pronouncements is one dedicated to preserving a racial hierarchy that can be seen in Trump’s own Cabinet and White House, both overwhelmingly white and among the least diverse in recent U.S. history.\\u200b\\n\\nScholars describe Trump’s record on race in historically harsh terms. Carol Anderson, a professor of African American Studies at Emory University, compared Trump to Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Abraham Lincoln as president and helped Southern Whites reestablish much of the racial hegemony they had seemingly lost in the Civil War.\\n\\n“Johnson made it clear that he was really the president of a few people, not the American people,” Anderson said. “And Trump has done the same.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA second White House official who worked closely with Trump quibbled with the comparison, but only because later Oval Office occupants also had intolerant views.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Woodrow Wilson was outwardly a white supremacist,” the former official said. “I don’t think Trump is as bad as Wilson. But he might be.”\\n\\nWhite House officials vigorously dispute such characterizations.\\n\\n“Donald Trump’s record as a private citizen and as president has been one of fighting for inclusion and advocating for the equal treatment of all,” said Sarah Matthews, a White House spokeswoman. “Anyone who suggests otherwise is only seeking to sow division.”\\n\\nNo senior U.S. official interviewed could recall Trump uttering a racial or ethnic slur while in office. Nor did any consider him an adherent of white supremacy or white nationalism, extreme ideologies that generally sanction violence to protect White interests or establish a racially pure ethno-state.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhite House officials also pointed to achievements that have benefited minorities, including job growth and prison-sentence reform.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut even those points fade under scrutiny. Black unemployment has surged disproportionately during the coronavirus pandemic, and officials said Trump regretted reducing prison sentences when it didn’t produce a spike in Black voter support.\\n\\nAnd there are indications that even Trump’s allies are worried about his record on race. The Republican Party devoted much of its convention in August to persuading voters that Trump is not a racist, with far more Black speakers at the four-day event than have held top White House positions over the past four years. \\u200b\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis story is based on interviews with more than two dozen current and former officials, including some who have had daily interactions with the president, as well as experts on race and members of white supremacist groups. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing a desire to provide candid accounts of events and conversations they witnessed without fear of retribution.\\n\\nCoded racial terms\\n\\nMost attributed Trump’s views on race and conduct to a combination of the prevailing attitudes of his privileged upbringing in the 1950s in what was then a predominantly White borough of New York, as well as a cynical awareness that coded racial terms and gestures can animate substantial portions of his political base.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe perspectives of those closest to the president are shaped by their own biases and self-interests. They have reason to resist the idea that they served a racist president. And they are, with few exceptions, themselves White males.\\n\\nOthers have offered less charitable assessments.\\n\\nOmarosa Manigault Newman, one of the few Black women to have worked at the White House, said in her 2018 memoir that she was enlisted by White House aides to track down a rumored recording from “The Apprentice” — the reality show on which she was a contestant — in which Trump allegedly used the n-word. A former official said that others involved in the effort included Trump adviser Hope Hicks and former White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe tape, if it exists, was never recovered. But Manigault Newman, who was forced out after clashing with other White House staff, portrayed the effort to secure the tape as evidence that aides saw Trump capable of such conduct. In the book, she described Trump as “a racist, misogynist and bigot.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMary L. Trump, the president’s niece, has said that casual racism was prevalent in the Trump family. In interviews to promote her recently published book, she has said that she witnessed her uncle using both anti-Semitic slurs as well as the n-word, though she offered few details and no evidence.\\n\\nMichael Cohen, the president’s former lawyer, has made similar allegations and calls Trump “a racist, a predator, a con man” in a newly published book. Cohen accuses Trump of routinely disparaging people of color, including former president Barack Obama. “Tell me one country run by a Black person that isn’t a s---hole,” Trump said, according to Cohen.\\n\\nThese authors did not provide direct evidence of Trump’s racist outbursts, but the animus they describe aligns with the prejudice Trump so frequently displays in public.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn recent months, Trump has condemned Black Lives Matter as a “symbol of hate” while defending armed White militants who entered the Michigan Capitol, right-wing activists who waved weapons from pickup trucks in Portland and a White teen who shot and killed two protesters in Wisconsin.\\n\\nTrump has vowed to safeguard the legacies of Confederate generals while skipping the funeral of the late congressman John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights icon, and retweeted — then deleted — video of a supporter shouting “White power” while questioning the electoral eligibility of Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), the nation’s first Black and Asian American candidate for vice president from a major party. In so doing, Trump reanimated a version of the false “birther” claim he had used to suggest that Obama may not have been born in the United States.\\n\\nThese add to an already voluminous record of incendiary statements, including his tweet that minority congresswomen should “go back” to their “crime infested” countries despite being U.S.-born or U.S. citizens, and his claim that there were “very fine people on both sides” after torch-carrying white nationalists staged a violent protest in Charlottesville.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn a measure of Trump’s standing with such organizations, the Stormfront website — the oldest and largest neo-Nazi platform on the Internet — recently issued a call to its followers to mobilize.\\n\\n“If Trump doesn’t win this election, the police will be abolished and Blacks will come to your house and kill you and your family,” the site warned. “This isn’t about politics anymore, it is about basic survival.”\\n\\nAs the election approaches, Trump has also employed apocalyptic language. He recently claimed that if Democratic nominee Joe Biden is elected, police departments will be dismantled, the American way of life will be “abolished” and “no one will be SAFE.”\\n\\nGiven the country’s anguished history, it is hard to isolate Trump’s impact on the racial climate in the United States. But his first term has coincided with the most intense period of racial upheaval in a generation. And the country is now in the final stretch of a presidential campaign that is more explicitly focused on race — including whether the sitting president is a racist — than any election in modern American history.\\n\\nBiden has seized on the issue from the outset. In a video declaring his candidacy, he used images from the clashes in Charlottesville, and said he felt compelled to run because of Trump’s response. He has called Trump the nation’s first racist president and pledged to use his presidency to heal divisions that are a legacy of the country’s “original sin” of slavery.\\n\\nExploiting societal divisions\\n\\nTrump has confronted allegations of racism in nearly every decade of his adult life. In the 1970s, the Trump family real estate empire was forced to settle a Justice Department lawsuit alleging systemic discrimination against Black apartment applicants. In the 1980s, he took out full-page ads calling for the death penalty against Black teens wrongly accused of a rape in Central Park. In the 2000s, Trump parlayed his baseless “birther” claim about Obama into a fervent far-right following.\\n\\nAs president, he has cast his record on race in grandiose terms. “I’ve done more for Black Americans than anybody with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln,” Trump said July 22, a refrain he has repeated at least five times in recent months.\\n\\nNone of the administration officials interviewed for this story agreed with Trump’s self-appraisals. But several sought to rationalize his behavior.\\n\\nSome argued that Trump only exploits societal divisions when he believes it is to his political advantage. They pointed to his denunciations of kneeling NFL players and paeans to the Confederate flag, claiming these symbols matter little to him beyond their ability to rouse supporters.\\n\\n“I don’t think Donald Trump is in any way a white supremacist, a neo-Nazi or anything of the sort,” a third former senior administration official said. “But I think he has a general awareness that one component of his base includes factions that trend in that direction.”\\n\\nStudies of the 2016 election have shown that racial resentment was a far bigger factor in propelling Trump to victory than economic grievance. Political scientists at Tufts University and the University of Massachusetts, for example, examined the election results and found that voters who scored highly on indexes of racism voted overwhelmingly for Trump, a dynamic particularly strong among non-college-educated Whites.\\n\\nSeveral current and former administration officials, somewhat paradoxically, cited Trump’s nonracial biases and perceived limitations as exculpatory.\\n\\nSeveral officials said that Trump is not a disciplined enough thinker to grasp the full dimensions of the white nationalist agenda, let alone embrace it. Others pointed out that they have observed him making far more offensive comments about women, insisting that his scorn is all-encompassing and therefore shouldn’t be construed as racist.\\n\\n“This is a guy who abuses people in his cabinet, abuses four-star generals, abuses people who gave their life for this country, abuses civil servants,” the first former senior White House official said. “It’s not like he doesn’t abuse people that are White as well.”\\n\\nNearly all said that Trump places far greater value on others’ wealth, fame or loyalty to him than he does on race or ethnicity. In so doing, many raised a version of the “some of my best friends are Black” defense on behalf of the president.\\n\\nWhen faced with allegations of racism in the 2016 campaign, Trump touted his friendship with boxing promoter Don King to argue otherwise. Administration officials similarly pointed to the president’s connection to Black people who have praised him, worked for him or benefited from his help.\\n\\nThey cited Trump’s admiration for Tiger Woods and other Black athletes, the political support he has received from Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and other Black lawmakers, the president’s fondness for Ja’Ron Smith, who as assistant to the president for domestic policy is the highest-ranking Black staffer at the White House, and his pardon of Black criminal-justice-reform advocate Alice Marie Johnson, expunging her 1996 conviction for cocaine trafficking.\\n\\nIn his speech at the Republican National Convention, Scott used his personal story of bootstrap success to emphasize the ways that Republican policies on taxes, school choice and other issues create opportunities for minorities.\\n\\nTrump “has fought alongside me” on such issues, Scott said, urging voters “not to look simply at what the candidates say, but to look back at what they’ve done.”\\n\\nFor all the prominence that Scott and other Black Trump supporters were given at the convention, there has been no corresponding representation within the Trump administration.\\n\\nThe official photo stream of Trump’s presidency is a slide show of a commander in chief surrounded by White faces, whether meeting with Cabinet members or posing with the latest intern crop.\\n\\nFrom the outset, his leadership team has been overwhelmingly White. A Washington Post tally identified 59 people who have held Cabinet positions or served in top White House jobs including chief of staff, press secretary and national security adviser since Trump took office.\\n\\nOnly seven have been people of color, including Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who are of Lebanese heritage. Only one — Ben Carson, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development — is Black.\\n\\nUnder Trump, the nation’s federal courts have also become increasingly White. Of the 248 judges confirmed or nominated since Trump took office, only eight were Black and eight were Hispanic, according to records compiled by NPR News.\\n\\nRetreating from civil rights\\n\\nTrump can point to policy initiatives that have benefited Black or other minority groups, including criminal justice reforms that reduced prison sentences for thousands of Black men convicted of nonviolent, drug-related crimes.\\n\\nAbout 4,700 inmates have been released or had their sentences reduced under the First Step Act, an attempt to reverse the lopsided legacy of the drug wars of the 1980s and 1990s, which disproportionately targeted African Americans. But this policy was championed primarily by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, and former officials said that Trump only agreed to support the measure when told it might boost his low poll numbers with Black voters.\\n\\nMonths later, when that failed to materialize, Trump “went s---house crazy,” one former official said, yelling at aides, “Why the hell did I do that?”\\n\\nManigault Newman was similarly excoriated when her efforts to boost funding for historically Black colleges failed to deliver better polling numbers for the president, officials said. “You’ve been at this for four months, Omarosa,” Trump said, according to one adviser, “but the numbers haven’t budged.” Manigault Newman did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nWhite House officials cited other initiatives aimed at helping people of color, including loan programs targeting minority businesses and the creation of “opportunity zones” in economically distressed communities.\\n\\nTrump has pointed most emphatically to historically low Black unemployment rates during his first term, arguing that data show they have fared better under his administration than under Obama or any other president.\\n\\nBut unemployment statistics are largely driven by broader economic trends, and the early gains of Black workers have been wiped out by the pandemic. Blacks have lost jobs at higher rates than other groups since the economy began to shut down. The jobless rate for Blacks in August was 13 percent, compared with 7.3 percent for Whites — the highest racial disparity in nearly six years.\\n\\nNeither prison reform nor minority jobs programs were priorities of Trump’s first term. His administration has devoted far more energy and political capital to erecting barriers to non-White immigrants, dismantling the health-care policies of Obama and pulling federal agencies back from civil rights battlegrounds.\\n\\nUnder Trump, the Justice Department has cut funding in its Civil Rights Division, scaled back prosecutions of hate crimes, all but abandoned efforts to combat systemic discrimination by police departments and backed state measures that deprived minorities of the right to vote.\\n\\nWeeks after Trump took office, the department announced it was abandoning its six-year involvement in a legal battle with Texas over a 2011 voter ID law that a federal court had ruled unfairly targeted minorities.\\n\\nLater, the department went from opposing, under Obama, an Ohio law that allowed the state to purge tens of thousands of voters from its rolls to defending the measure before the Supreme Court.\\n\\nThe law was upheld by the court’s conservative majority. In a dissenting opinion, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted that voter rolls in African American neighborhoods shrank by 10 percent, compared with 4 percent in majority-White suburbs.\\n\\nThe Justice Department’s shift when faced with allegations of systemic racism by police departments has been even more stark.\\n\\nAfter the Rodney King beating in Los Angeles in 1991, Congress gave the department new power to investigate law enforcement agencies suspected of engaging in a “pattern or practice” of systemic — including racist — misconduct. The probes frequently led to settlements that required sweeping reforms.\\n\\nThe authority was put to repeated use by three consecutive presidents: 25 times under Bill Clinton, 21 under George W. Bush and 25 under Obama. Under Trump, there has been only one.\\n\\nThe collapse has coincided with a surge in police killings captured on video, the largest civil rights protests in decades and polling data that suggests a profound turn in public opinion in support of the Black Lives Matter cause — though that support has waned in recent weeks as protests became violent in some cities.\\n\\nA Justice Department spokesman pointed to nearly a dozen cases over the past three years in which the department has prosecuted hate crimes or launched racial discrimination lawsuits. In perhaps the most notable case, James Fields Jr., who was convicted of murder for driving his car into a crowd of protesters in Charlottesville, also pleaded guilty to federal hate crime charges.\\n\\n“The Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice is vigorously fighting race discrimination throughout the United States. Any assertion to the contrary is completely false,” said Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband. “Since 2017, we have prosecuted criminal and civil race discrimination cases in all parts of the United States, and we will continue to do so.”\\n\\nBut the department has not launched a pattern or practice probe into any of the police departments involved in the killings that ignited this summer’s protests, including the May 25 death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, who asphyxiated after a White policeman kept him pinned to the ground for nearly eight minutes with a knee to his neck.\\n\\nThe department has opened a more narrow investigation of the officers directly involved in Floyd’s death. Attorney General William P. Barr called Floyd’s killing “shocking,” but in congressional testimony argued there was no reason to commit to a broader probe of Minneapolis or any other police force.\\n\\n“I don’t believe there is systemic racism in police departments,” Barr said.\\n\\nDeport, deny and discourage\\n\\nDays after the 2016 election, David Duke, a longtime leader of the Ku Klux Klan, tweeted that Trump’s win was “great for our people.” Richard Spencer, another prominent white nationalist figure, was captured on video leading a “Hail Trump” salute at an alt-right conference in Washington.\\n\\nPeople with far-right views or white nationalist sympathies gravitated to the administration.\\n\\nMichael Anton, who published a 2016 essay comparing the country’s course under Obama to that of an aircraft controlled by Islamist terrorists and called for an end to “the ceaseless importation of Third World foreigners,” became deputy national security adviser for strategic communication.\\n\\nIan Smith served as an immigration policy analyst at the Department of Homeland Security until email records showed connections with Spencer and other white supremacists. Darren Beattie worked as a White House speechwriter before leaving abruptly when CNN reported his involvement in a conference frequented by white nationalists.\\n\\nStephen K. Bannon, who for years used Breitbart News to advance an alt-right, anti-immigrant agenda, was named White House chief strategist, only to be banished eight months later after clashing with other administration officials.\\n\\nStephen Miller, by contrast, has survived a series of White House purges and used his position as senior adviser to the president to push hard-line policies that aim to deport, deny and discourage non-European immigrants.\\n\\nWhile working for the Trump campaign in 2016, Miller sent a steady stream of story ideas to Breitbart drawn from white nationalist websites, according to email records obtained by the Southern Poverty Law Center. In one exchange, Miller urged a Breitbart reporter to read “Camp of the Saints,” a French novel that depicts the destruction of Western civilization by rampant immigration. The book has become a touchpoint for white supremacist groups.\\n\\nMiller was the principal architect of, and driving force behind, the so-called Muslim Ban issued in the early days of Trump’s presidency and the separation of migrant children from their parents along the border with Mexico. He has also worked behind the scenes to turn public opinion against immigrants and outmaneuver bureaucratic adversaries, officials said.\\n\\nTo blunt allegations of racism and xenophobia in the administration’s policies, Miller has sought to portray them as advantageous to people of color. In several instances, Miller directed subordinates to “look for Latinos or Blacks who have been victims of a crime by an immigrant,” then pressured officials at the Department of Homeland Security to tout these cases to the press, one official said. Families of some victims appeared as prominent guests of the president at the State of the Union address.\\n\\nIn 2018, as Miller sought to slash the number of refugees admitted to the United States, Pentagon officials argued that the existing policy was crucial to their ability to relocate interpreters and other foreign nationals who risked their lives to work with U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.\\n\\n“What do you want? Iraqi communities across the United States?” Miller erupted during one meeting of National Security Council deputies, according to witnesses. The refugee limit has plunged since Trump took office, from 85,000 in 2016 to 18,000 this year.\\n\\nIn response to a request for comment from Miller, Matthews, the White House spokeswoman, said that “this attempt to vilify Stephen Miller with egregious and unfounded allegations from anonymous sources is shameful and completely unethical.”\\n\\nAs a descendant of Jewish immigrants, Miller is regarded warily by white supremacist organizations even as they applaud some of his actions.\\n\\n“Our side doesn’t consider him one of us — for obvious reasons,” said Don Black, the founder of the Stormfront website, in an interview. “He’s kind of an odd choice to be the white nationalist in the White House.”\\n\\nThe moral character of his presidency\\n\\nTrump’s presidency has corresponded with a surge in activity by white nationalist groups, as well as concern about the growing danger they pose.\\n\\nRecent assessments by the Department of Homeland Security describe white supremacists as the country’s gravest domestic threat, exceeding that of the Islamic State and other terror groups, according to documents obtained by the Lawfare national security website and reported by Politico.\\n\\nThe FBI has expanded resources to tracking hate groups and crimes. FBI Director Christopher A. Wray testified Thursday that “racially motivated violent extremism” accounts for the bulk of the bureau’s domestic terrorism cases, and that most of those are driven by white supremacist ideology.\\n\\nMajor rallies staged by white nationalist organizations, which were already on the upswing just before the 2016 election, increased in size and frequency after Trump took office, according to Brian Levin, an expert on hate groups at California State University at San Bernardino.\\n\\nThe largest, and most ominous, was the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville.\\n\\nOn Aug. 11, 2017, hundreds of white supremacists, neo-fascists and Confederate sympathizers descended on the city. Purportedly there to protest the planned removal of a Robert E. Lee statue, they carried torches and chanted slogans including “blood and soil” and “you will not replace us” laden with Klan and Nazi symbolism.\\n\\nThe event erupted in violence the next day, Saturday, when Fields, a self-proclaimed white supremacist, drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, tossing bodies into the air. Heather Heyer, a 32-year-old Virginia native and peace activist, was killed.\\n\\nTrump’s vacillating response in the ensuing days came to mark one of the defining sequences of his presidency.\\n\\nSpeaking from his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J., Trump at first stuck to a calibrated script: “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence.” Then, improvising, he added: “on many sides, on many sides.”\\n\\nIn six words, Trump had drawn a moral equivalency between the racist ideology of those responsible for the Klan-like spectacle and the competing beliefs that compelled Heyer and others to confront hate.\\n\\nTrump’s comments set off what some in the White House came to regard as a behind-the-scenes struggle for the moral character of his presidency.\\n\\nJohn F. Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general who was just weeks into his job as White House chief of staff, confronted Trump in the corridors of the Bedminster club. “You have to fix this,” Kelly said, according to officials familiar with the exchange. “You were supporting white supremacists. You have to go back out and correct this.”\\n\\nGary Cohn, the White House economic adviser at the time, threatened to resign and argued that there were no “good people” among the ranks of those wearing swastikas and chanting “Jews will not replace us.” In a heated exchange, Cohn criticized Trump for his “many sides” comment, and was flummoxed when Trump denied that was what he had said.\\n\\n“Not only did you say it, you continued to double down on it,” Cohn shot back, according to officials familiar with the exchange. “And if you want, I’ll get the transcripts.”\\n\\nTrump relented that Monday and delivered the ringing condemnation of racism that Kelly, Cohn and others had urged. “Racism is evil,” he said, “and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups”\\n\\nAides were briefly elated. But Trump grew agitated by news coverage depicting his speech as an attempt to correct his initial blunder.\\n\\nThe next day, during an event at Trump Tower that was supposed to highlight infrastructure initiatives, Trump launched into a fiery monologue.\\n\\n“You had a group on one side that was bad,” he said. “You had a group on the other side that was also very violent. Nobody wants to say that. I’ll say it right now.” By the end, the president appeared to be sanctioning racial divisions far beyond Charlottesville, saying “there are two sides to the country.”\\n\\nFor all their consternation, none of Trump’s top aides resigned over Charlottesville. Kelly remained in his job through 2018. Cohn stayed until March 2018 after being asked to lead the administration’s tax-reform initiative and reassured that he could share his own views about Charlottesville in public without retaliation from the president.\\n\\nKelly and Cohn declined to comment.\\n\\nThe most senior former administration official to comment publicly on Trump’s conduct on issues of race is former defense secretary Jim Mattis. After Trump responded to Black Lives Matter protests in Washington this summer with paramilitary force, Mattis responded with a blistering statement.\\n\\n“Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people — does not even pretend to try,” Mattis said. “Instead, he tries to divide us.”\\n\\nIn some ways, Charlottesville represented a high-water mark for white nationalism in Trump’s presidency. Civil rights groups were able to use footage of the mayhem in Virginia to identify members of hate groups and expose them to their employers, universities and families.\\n\\n“Charlottesville backfired,” Levin said. Many of those who took part, especially the alt-right leadership, “were doxed, sued and beaten back,” he said, using a term for using documents available from public records to expose individuals.\\n\\n“When the door to the big political tent closed on these overtly white nationalist groups, many collapsed, leaving a decentralized constituency of loose radicals now reorganizing under new banners,” Levin said.\\n\\nSome white nationalist leaders have begun to express disenchantment with Trump because he has failed to deliver on campaign promises they hoped would bring immigration to a standstill or perhaps even ignite a race war.\\n\\n“A lot of our people were expecting him to actually secure the borders, build the wall and make Mexico pay for it,” Black said.\\n\\n“Some in my circles want to see him defeated,” Black said, because they believe a Biden presidency would call less attention to the white nationalist movement than Trump has, while fostering discontent among White people.\\n\\nBut Black sees those views as dangerously shortsighted, failing to appreciate the extraordinary advantages of having a president who so regularly aligns himself with aspects of the movement’s agenda.\\n\\n“Symbolically, he’s still very important,” Black said of Trump. “I don’t think he considers himself a white supremacist or a white nationalist. But I think he may be a racial realist. He knows there are racial differences.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/latino-groups-warn-that-bidens-sluggish-outreach-could-have-devastating-results/2020/09/13/82dab318-f44b-11ea-bc45-e5d48ab44b9f_story.html', 'Full Text': \"“Within the last two weeks, they’ve been making an effort to put all the pieces in place,” said José Parra, who served as a senior adviser to Harry M. Reid when he was Senate majority leader and lives in Miami. “What worries me is how late in the game they are trying to put those pieces into place.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Democratic anxiety extends to Arizona, which the party hopes to turn blue for the first time in 24 years, as well as Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Georgia — all states where the Latino vote is important. Adding to Biden’s challenge in Florida, a must-win state for Trump, is the complexity of the Hispanic population, where the president is popular among conservative Cuban Americans and Republican attacks on Democrats as “socialists” have resonated.\\n\\nCritics, including some close Biden allies, are frustrated that the Democratic nominee has not given a major speech on Latino issues, advertised more aggressively and earlier on Spanish-language media, or given more interviews to Latino news outlets.\\n\\n“The campaign understands that this is a priority, but at the same time there needs to be a little bit more support shown,” said Julián Castro, the only Latino who ran in the Democratic presidential primary. He added, “If we allow a narrative to take shape that somehow the issues of concern to this growing community are not prioritized, then we risk backsliding in the years to come.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNational surveys show Biden faring slightly worse with Latinos than Hillary Clinton in 2016, when she won the group by 38 points. No one on either side expects Biden to lose the Latino vote; the question is the size of his margin.\\n\\nThe issue is particularly stark because Trump is seen by so many activists as more anti-immigrant and anti-Latino than any president in memory. He began his 2016 campaign suggesting that many Mexican immigrants are “rapists,” and later he questioned the objectivity of a judge of Mexican descent.\\n\\nBut Latino leaders say Biden has yet to overcome suspicion of Barack Obama’s tough deportation policies or outline his own immigration plans in greater detail; that his inner circle lacks enough Latino decision-makers; and that his campaign has focused almost entirely on White suburbanites and African Americans to the detriment of their community. Latino Democrats also worry about the onslaught of Republican attacks casting them as socialist sympathizers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBiden campaign officials said they are steadily building an aggressive Latino outreach program, with Latino vote directors in 11 states and micro-targeted efforts in various communities. The campaign’s advertising includes specially curated speakers — with Mexican accents in Arizona, Cuban accents in Miami, and Puerto Rican accents in Orlando and Tampa.\\n\\nThe campaign has divided Florida into three regions with individual Latino vote directors and ramped up its staffing and ads.\\n\\n“We take Florida extremely seriously,” said Cristóbal Alex, a senior Biden adviser who works on Latino outreach. “As the vice president said in my very first sit-down with him, we are committed to competing for every single vote.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLatino leaders routinely note that the community is far more complex and varied than many strategists assume. Some Latinos are quite conservative, holding traditional religious and social positions, while others are young and liberal, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had significant success in attracting their support during the Democratic presidential primary. Chuck Rocha, who spearheaded Sanders’s Latino outreach, said the party now risks leaving behind a hugely influential population.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“There is still no direct investment into the community to get our vote out,” said Rocha, who now runs a super PAC aiming to boost Latino turnout in November. “We’re still doubling, tripling, quadrupling down on White women and White steelworkers in Michigan.” Rocha said he is struggling to secure funding to air an ad featuring young Latinos who supported Sanders in the primary and now back Biden.\\n\\nSanders himself has voiced private concerns about Biden’s standing with the community, according to three people with knowledge of the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. The senator from Vermont “thinks that a stronger outreach to young people, the Latino community and the progressive movement will be of real help to the campaign,” said his former campaign manager, Faiz Shakir.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBiden campaign officials strongly reject the notion that Latino voters are not a priority. “We really see the coalition to win as helping to rebuild the original Obama-Biden coalition,” said Biden deputy campaign manager Julie Chávez Rodríguez, the granddaughter of labor activist César Chávez. “That definitely includes White voters and African American voters, but it also includes Latino voters, [Asian American and Pacific Islander] voters and the tribal community.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPre-pandemic projections showed that Latinos were on pace to be the largest racial or ethnic minority group in the electorate, accounting for just over 13 percent of eligible voters, according to the Pew Research Center. But if persuasion is one challenge Democrats face in courting them, mobilization is another.\\n\\nThat is compounded by the pandemic, which has disproportionately hit Latino communities and prompted a national move toward mail-in voting. “The Latino community has lower confidence in mail-in voting than other communities,” Castro said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNo state is more urgent for Democrats than Florida, whose vote could determine the next president. Trump’s fading popularity among Florida seniors due to his handling of the virus gives Biden an opening, but that has been offset in part by the former vice president’s lackluster support from Florida Latinos, making the state essentially a toss-up.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBiden’s trip to the state Tuesday will mark his first visit to Florida as the Democratic nominee, and it is seen by many state Democrats as part of a scramble to shore up Latino support. While the campaign has been tight-lipped about Biden’s specific activities Tuesday, Latino activists hope he will deliver rousing remarks aimed at energizing their communities.\\n\\nMany would have liked to see that earlier this year. Instead, Latino activists and strategists said, the Biden campaign was slow to fully engage despite entreaties from local Democrats, while the Trump campaign jumped in. They cite a run of Trump ads in the early summer on Florida Spanish-language television, which was not matched robustly by Biden until about three weeks later.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNow, the Biden campaign is outspending Trump in every Hispanic media market, Alex said. In Florida, Biden’s campaign is engaged in text-banking in Spanish and has organized daily calls to Hispanic radio stations. Trump, one aide noted, has been campaigning in the state for years, a head start Biden did not have.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMore broadly, Trump argues that he has been a wonderful president for the Latino community, especially by creating jobs, a boast that glosses over the economic devastation of the pandemic.\\n\\n“We’ve done really well with Hispanics,” Trump said at a White House roundtable with Latino leaders in July. “We like them, they like me, and we’ve helped them a lot with the jobs. Whether it’s jobs, education, or so many other things, it’s been really good.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe politics of Florida’s Latino community — like all politics in the state — are complex. Florida is home to the country's largest Cuban American population, which often holds more conservative views than other Latino voters. But it also includes a fast-growing Puerto Rican population, which leans Democratic, as well as many voters of Mexican, Colombian, and Venezuelan descent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump’s pursuit of a more restrictive policy toward Cuba has won him support in the Cuban American community, analysts in both parties say. Aggressive GOP efforts to cast Democrats as radical socialists, even if inaccurate, also have had an effect, Democrats said, particularly when left largely unchallenged.\\n\\n“They’ve repeated it for so long that they really have caused fear in our community,” said Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D-Fla.), who emigrated from Ecuador when she was 14. “Yes, maybe we should have rejected that premise much earlier. But when something is so far from the truth, the initial reaction, I think, was to just completely dismiss it, not even address it.”\\n\\nOn Sunday, Trump tweeted that “Sleepy Joe Biden has spent 47 years in politics being terrible to Hispanics. Now he is relying on Castro lover Bernie Sanders to help him out.” Sanders has praised Cuban dictator Fidel Castro’s literacy program, while criticizing his authoritarianism.\\n\\nTrump also has been outspoken on Venezuela, but has sent a more muddled message. He initially touted his hard line against authoritarian leader Nicolás Maduro, before opening the door to a meeting and then backtracking.\\n\\nRecent polls by NBC News/Marist and Quinnipiac University show Biden and Trump running about even among Latino voters in Florida — while Clinton outpaced Trump by 27 points with the group four years ago. Similarly, a poll of voters in Miami-Dade County, home to many Latinos, showed Trump trailing Biden by 17; he lost there by 30 points in 2016.\\n\\nAnd even with Clinton’s commanding margin among Latinos, “that still was not enough to win the state,” said Democratic pollster Fernand Amandi, whose firm conducted the survey, adding that this is “one of the reasons there is such consternation” over the poll.\\n\\nBiden’s allies play down the polls’ significance, citing their small sample sizes and English-only interviews. Biden officials said they have conducted their own polling of Latinos in Florida but declined to reveal the results.\\n\\nTrump, for his part, is placing great emphasis on Florida. He recently changed his residence to the state from Manhattan; his presence is enhanced by his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach; and top campaign aide Brad Parscale lives there. Recent moves also could bolster the president, including his recent expansion of an offshore drilling ban and his brokering of Israel’s acceptance by more Arab nations, an issue important to Florida’s sizable Jewish community.\\n\\nTrump’s campaign has routinely attacked Biden in Florida, running ads that intersperse video of Biden touting his progressive bona fides with images of leftist Latin American dictators.\\n\\nWhile such efforts to portray Biden — a centrist Democrat who has roundly rejected socialism — as a radical socialist have not resonated nationally, Trump supporters hope they can be more effective in Florida.\\n\\nAmong those backers is Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who defied the 2018 Democratic wave to win his seat thanks in part to significant support from Latino voters. “They seem pretty confident,” Scott said of the Trump team’s outlook on Florida.\\n\\nAnd the state may be more fluid than other battlegrounds. Further roiling the landscape, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg plans to spend at least $100 million in the state on Biden’s behalf, The Washington Post reported Sunday, a massive 11th-hour infusion that will fund ads in Spanish as well as English.\\n\\nBiden has clearly begun approaching Florida with more urgency, adding experienced Florida strategists to his staff and devoting more attention to the state. His campaign has stepped up his aggressiveness on the airwaves, releasing new Spanish-language TV and radio commercials on Saturday challenging Trump’s rhetoric. One ad contrasts Trump with Biden on the economy and the pandemic, flashing photos of Biden alongside Obama, who won the state twice.\\n\\nThe campaign also has tapped Biden’s running mate, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a daughter of immigrants who hails from a state with a large Hispanic population, to take on a large share of the Latino outreach.\\n\\nHarris campaigned in Florida on Thursday, stopping at an arepas restaurant in Doral, a Miami suburb with a large Venezuelan population. During one exchange, Harris referred to her husband in Spanish as “mi esposo.” On Saturday, Harris held a virtual conversation with local Latino business owners in Arizona.\\n\\nAnnette Taddeo, a Florida state senator who had urged the Biden campaign to do more Latino outreach, joined Harris on her visit and gave her high marks. Taddeo said “the fact there are numerous polls” showing trouble with Latinos for Biden “is definitely alarming,” but that “the campaign is responding as they should.”\\n\\n“They are just waking up to the coffee,” added Roberto Rodriguez Tejera, who hosts a Spanish-language radio show in the Miami area.\\n\\nIn another sign of that, Nuestro PAC — headed by Rocha, Sanders’s former Latino outreach coordinator — plans to send 3 million pieces of mail to persuadable Latino voters in Florida and other battleground states. Rocha said he conducted summer focus groups revealing that persuadable Latino voters did not want to hear about Trump, but rather more about Biden and “what he’s actually going to do to make our lives better.”\\n\\nIf Biden prevails in November, Rocha quipped, the news headline at the end of the race might be, “Bernie Sanders’s Latino team saves Joe Biden’s a--.”\"}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/10/some-assertions-donald-i-dont-want-people-panic-trump-has-made-since-february/', 'Full Text': '“The fact is, I’m a cheerleader for this country. I love our country,” Trump said during an event at the White House on Tuesday. “And I don’t want people to be frightened. I don’t want to create panic, as you say. And certainly, I’m not going to drive this country or the world into a frenzy.”\\n\\nOne can certainly argue that there is a difference between being honest with the public and instilling panic. It’s the difference between the phlebotomist saying that you’ll feel a slight pinch and his trying to get you to look in the other direction while he without warning jams a needle into your arm. My 3-year-old doesn’t like medicine, but we’re past the point where we pretend he’s just getting a funny-colored glass of apple juice.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut here, that’s not really the most galling aspect of Trump’s claim. Instead, it’s that Trump’s politics are almost entirely predicated on attempting to frighten people. From his campaign announcement rife with Mexican “rapists” to his first three years in office, during which time the nation was constantly imperiled by terrorist immigrants and immigrant terrorists, Trumpism is fundamentally about fearmongering.\\n\\nTrump told The Washington Post’s Bob Woodward on Feb. 7 about the danger posed by the coronavirus. Since that date, here is a partial list of occasions on which Trump and his reelection campaign have deliberately sought to whip up fear to bolster his reelection chances.\\n\\nThat evening. Trump spoke at an event in North Carolina.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“You see what’s happening on the other side,” he said. “They want to take everything away. They want to destroy everything we’ve built. We’ve got the most successful country in our history. They want to take it away.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFeb. 11. A warning about the Second Amendment: “The Democrats want to take away the guns. They want to take away everyone’s gun. They want to destroy the Second Amendment.”\\n\\nFeb. 19. At a rally in Phoenix — an indoor rally, attended by thousands of people — Trump again warned about the dangers of voting Democratic.\\n\\n“While the socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American health care and your Social Security,” he said, “my administration is protecting your Social Security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great health care, and that’s what we’re getting.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe repeated the claim at another rally the following night and again the night after that.\\n\\nFeb. 28. Another rally. Democrats, Trump claims, “want to treat illegal aliens, people that come into our country illegally, better than they want to treat our military and our veterans. … They want open borders, they don’t care about crime. … They want to take away your health care.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPerhaps worried he was being too subtle, he was more direct a bit later.\\n\\n“At stake in our present battle is the actual survival of our nation,” he said. “I really believe that. It’s a survival. You see these maniacs that we’re dealing with. … If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have towards victory in November of 2020 — November 3, to be exact.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMarch 2. A rally in Charlotte.\\n\\nThe Democrats’ “plans would massively raise your taxes, destroy our liberty, muzzle our faith and erase our sovereignty, you know that,” Trump claimed. “The Democrat Party has gone crazy.”\\n\\nMarch 6.\\n\\nApril 19. During a briefing on the coronavirus pandemic, Trump took a shot at former vice president Joe Biden, his opponent in November’s general election.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIran will “own America if Biden gets — and they know, with me, doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t work that way. If — if Joe Biden got in, they’d own America,” Trump said. “Between them, China, Japan, Mexico, Canada, they’d own America. You wouldn’t have a country left if he got in.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJune 1. After a few months in which Trump’s rhetoric was mostly targeted at the pandemic, he turned his rhetoric back to the election.\\n\\nJune 20. At his smaller-than-expected rally in Tulsa, Trump again warned about Democrats in vague terms.\\n\\n“They’ve done a terrible job and they shouldn’t be awarded,” he said. “They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3. That shouldn’t happen. It’ll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed.”\\n\\nJune 21.\\n\\nJune 23. At another event in Phoenix, similar warnings.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“As we fight to restore, renew and rebuild our country, the hard left is trying to divide, denigrate and destroy our country,” Trump claimed. “ … This is a choice of two futures: the left’s vision of disunity and discord or our vision of equal opportunity and equal justice. Every American should take a long look at the bedlam in Seattle, because that’s exactly what will come to every city near you, every suburb and community in America, if the radical-left Democrats are put in charge.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJune 25. Talking to his friend Sean Hannity, Trump again disparaged Biden.\\n\\n“He is a candidate that will destroy this country,” Trump said. “And he may not do it himself. He will be run by a radical fringe group of lunatics that will destroy our country, and people have to know that.”\\n\\nJuly 2. Trump’s reelection campaign releases this ad.\\n\\nJuly 3. In a high-profile speech given near Mount Rushmore, Trump offered a grim assessment of what was to come.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“As we meet here tonight, there is a growing danger that threatens every blessing our ancestors fought so hard for, struggled, they bled to secure,” Trump claimed. “Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values and indoctrinate our children.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Make no mistake,” he added later, “this left-wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the American Revolution. In so doing, they would destroy the very civilization that rescued billions from poverty, disease, violence and hunger and that lifted humanity to new heights of achievement, discovery and progress.”\\n\\nAnd so on.\\n\\nJuly 13. At a roundtable about policing, Trump offered an aside: “If Biden got in, this economy would be destroyed.”\\n\\nLater, a tweet.\\n\\nJuly 14. At an event predicated on China’s crackdown in Hong Kong, another aside about Democrats: “They don’t want to have borders; they want to have open borders. It’s radical left, and it’ll destroy our country.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJuly 15.\\n\\nJuly 16. Trump goes into more detail about the purported threat posed to suburbs.\\n\\n“Joe Biden and his bosses from the radical left want to significantly multiply what they’re doing now,” he said. “And what will be the end result is you will totally destroy the beautiful suburbs. Suburbia will be no longer as we know it. So they wanted to defund and abolish your police and law enforcement while at the same time destroying our great suburbs.”\\n\\nJuly 17. Trump insists that while Biden says he doesn’t want to defund the police, he actually does, which would “destroy America.”\\n\\nJuly 18. Speaking to supporters, Trump again claimed that Biden’s “handlers” have dire plans.\\n\\n“Joe Biden handlers and they’re very radical left-wing people, the Biden people,” he said. “They want to destroy our police — destroy our police forces, tear down our history, and they want to demolish our economy, and we just can’t have that, we can’t have that, what they’re doing.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJuly 19. Biden wants to “destroy America’s economy, America’s security and our American way of life,” Trump casually informed another group of supporters.\\n\\nJuly 20. The campaign released this ad.\\n\\nJuly 29. Speaking to oil workers in Texas, Trump extrapolates outward.\\n\\n“As we have seen in cities and towns across our nation, it’s not just Texas oil that the radical Democrats want to destroy — they want to destroy our country,” he claimed. “These people are sick. They are sick. And you better get used to hearing it because they have some real problems. They don’t love our country in any way, shape or form. They don’t love our country. There’s no respect for the American way of life.”\\n\\nAug. 2. In a call with supporters in Pennsylvania, Trump tailored his claims.\\n\\n“They’d obliterate the Pennsylvania energy industry,” he said of Democrats, “destroy Pennsylvania’s economy, endanger Pennsylvania’s families and demolish the American way of life, as we all know it and love it.”\\n\\nAug. 5. A call with Georgia supporters goes further.\\n\\n“Biden supports raising your taxes by many times in some cases. We’re talking about massive tax increases, massive regulation increases, packing the courts with radical far-left judges and destroying your 401(k)s and your stocks,” Trump said.\\n\\n“If you have stocks, you can forget about it, because your 401(k)s and stocks will be literally destroyed,” he added. “You’re going to have open borders and you’re going to have a ripping down the wall. They want to rip down the wall, so people just flood in indiscriminately into our country. That’s not what we want.”\\n\\nA quick interjection to note that all of this falls somewhere between willfully hyperbolic and obviously false. As does this tweet:\\n\\nAug. 6. A speech in Ohio: “To fully restore American prosperity, we must stop the radical left-wing movement that would destroy our country.”\\n\\nAt another event the same day, Trump used more strident language.\\n\\n“You will have a crash in the markets because he’s going to double and triple your taxes; he’s going to do things that nobody ever would ever think even possible because he’s following the radical-left agenda,” he claimed. “Take away your guns, destroy your Second Amendment, no religion, no anything, hurt the Bible, hurt God. He’s against God.”\\n\\nAug. 10. Trump used a briefing to lambaste Biden.\\n\\n“If he wins, you know what’s going to happen? China will own us,” Trump said. “Our markets will crash. The 401(k)s will go down to practically nothing. Stocks will go down to practically nothing.”\\n\\nHe made various false claims about plans to raise taxes.\\n\\n“What they’re going to do,” he then added, “is destroy your health care and destroy so many other things.”\\n\\nAug. 11. Trump’s claims about Biden kept snowballing.\\n\\n“If Joe Biden and the radical Democrats get into power,” he told supporters in North Carolina, “they will destroy our country. Our stock market will crash.”\\n\\nBiden, he added later, will “pack the courts with radical far-left judges, destroy your stock market, destroy your 401(k)s, indoctrinate your children with the horrible things they’re learning in school, wants to open borders.”\\n\\n“This election is critical,” Trump said. “It’s a difference between our country going in a direction that will destroy our country or our country being greater than it’s ever been.”\\n\\nAug. 12. In a rhythm, Trump offered a similar litany in a call with Wisconsin supporters.\\n\\n“Biden wants to raise your taxes by double and triple and quadruple in some cases,” he said, “pack the courts with radical far-left judges, destroy your 401(k)s, your stocks and everything else, indoctrinate your children with some of the hate that you read coming out of the schools that we’ve ended, open your borders and rip down the wall.”\\n\\n“He wants to abolish borders,” Trump continued. “He wants to stop all deportations, end prosecutions of illegal border crossers, support sanctuary cities, incentivize illegal alien child smuggling, provide taxpayer-funded lawyers for illegal aliens, provide government health care for illegal aliens.”\\n\\nIn Biden’s America, he said at one point, “you and your family will never be safe. Hopefully you’ll never get to experience that.”\\n\\nJust to put a fine point on it, this was the president who on Wednesday claimed he doesn’t “want people to be frightened.”\\n\\nAug. 17. Trump pledged to protect the country from the Biden he imagined.\\n\\n“We’ll save our cities in our suburbs from the future of crime and chaos, corruption, and economic collapse that puppet Joe Biden would unleash on America,” Trump said at a rally in Minnesota.\\n\\nAt another event in the state, Trump asserted that Democrats had gotten far worse in the past four years.\\n\\n“Even 2016, as important as that was, it was different because they weren’t crazed at that time,” Trump said. “They weren’t so far radical left. They didn’t want to destroy our country. But now they’re looking at people that have very bad intentions, in my opinion.”\\n\\nAug. 19. The threat grows more dire.\\n\\n“We’re saving the world from a radical-left philosophy that will destroy this country,” Trump said at a briefing. “And when this country is gone, the rest of the world would follow. The rest of the world would follow.”\\n\\nAug. 20. “Joe Biden is a puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to destroy the American way of life,” Trump said flatly during a speech in Pennsylvania.\\n\\nAug. 24. The four-day Republican National Convention began. Speaker after speaker warned about the risk posed by Biden and the Democrats, generally in verbiage that mirrored Trump’s.\\n\\n“Trump was elected to protect our families from the vengeful mob that seeks to destroy our way of life, our neighborhoods, schools, churches and values,” the head of an organization that targets young conservatives said.\\n\\nSpeaking from their home in St. Louis, Mark and Patricia McCloskey — made famous in photographs and video showing them confronting peaceful protesters while armed — claimed that the criticism they faced was but the leading edge of what America would see.\\n\\n“It seems as if the Democrats no longer view the government’s job as protecting honest citizens from criminals,” Mark McCloskey asserted, “but rather protecting criminals from honest citizens.”\\n\\n“Make no mistake,” Patricia McCloskey said at one point: “No matter where you live, your family will not be safe in the radical Democrats’ America.” A bit later, she continued that argument: “When we don’t have basic safety and security in our communities, we’ll never be free to build a brighter future for ourselves, for our children, for our country. That’s what’s at stake in this election.”\\n\\nAug. 26.\\n\\nAug. 27. In his speech accepting the nomination, Trump offered a slew of claims about what Biden would do as president, nearly all of them wildly divergent from reality.\\n\\nHe claimed that Biden wants to shut down the economy (he doesn’t), that Biden wants to increase taxes on “almost all American families” (he doesn’t), that he wants to suspend all removals of undocumented immigrants (he doesn’t), that he would eliminate America’s borders (he wouldn’t), that he would confiscate guns (he wouldn’t) and that he supports defunding police (he doesn’t).\\n\\nAug. 28. “If our foreign adversaries were devising a plan to destroy the United States from within,” Trump said at a rally in New Hampshire, “all they have to look is at” the ticket of Biden and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif). If Biden wins, he adds, “the agitators will go from rioting in the streets to running the halls of government.”\\n\\nAug. 31.

This is the most important election in the history of our country.”\\n\\nHe tweeted a similar thought.\\n\\nSept. 9. While announcing an updated list of potential Supreme Court nominees, Trump offered a vision of what the court might look like should a Democrat become president.\\n\\n“If this extreme movement is granted a majority on the Supreme Court, it will fundamentally transform America without a single vote of Congress. Radical justices will erase the Second Amendment, silence political speech and require taxpayers to fund extreme late-term abortion. They will give unelected bureaucrats the power to destroy millions of American jobs. They will remove the words ‘under God’ from the Pledge of Allegiance. They will unilaterally declare the death penalty unconstitutional, even for the most depraved mass murderers. They will erase national borders, cripple police departments and grant new protections to anarchists, rioters, violent criminals and terrorists.”\\n\\nThis list is lengthy but not comprehensive. It’s mostly just occasions on which Trump warned that Biden would destroy things — the economy, the country, etc. But it gets the point across.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/ruth-bader-ginsburg-dies/2020/09/18/3cedc314-fa08-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html', 'Full Text': \"Born in Depression-era Brooklyn, Justice Ginsburg excelled academically and went to the top of her law school class at a time when women were still called upon to justify taking a man’s place. She earned a reputation as the legal embodiment of the women’s liberation movement and as a widely admired role model for generations of female lawyers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWorking in the 1970s with the American Civil Liberties Union, Justice Ginsburg successfully argued a series of cases before the high court that strategically chipped away at the legal wall of gender discrimination, eventually causing it to topple. Later, as a member of the court’s liberal bloc, she was a reliable vote to enhance the rights of women, protect affirmative action and minority voting rights and defend a woman’s right to choose an abortion.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn the court, she became an iconic figure to a new wave of young feminists, and her regal image as the “Notorious RBG” graced T-shirts and coffee mugs. She was delighted by the attention, although she said her law clerks had to explain that the moniker referred to a deceased rapper, the Notorious B.I.G. She also was the subject of a popular film documentary, “RBG” (2018).\\n\\nWhen she was named one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in 2015, her colleague and improbable close friend, conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, wrote about her dual roles as crusader and judge. “Ruth Bader Ginsburg has had two distinguished legal careers, either one of which would alone entitle her to be one of Time’s 100,” wrote Scalia, who died in 2016.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfter Scalia’s death, the Senate took no action to confirm President Barack Obama’s nominee to the court, U.S. Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland. President Trump, who took office in 2017, has nominated two new justices to the court, Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh, the latter succeeding Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNPR reported that Justice Ginsburg, in a statement dictated to her granddaughter in recent days, said, “My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.”\\n\\nA landmark moment for Justice Ginsburg came in 2011, when the court for the first time opened its term with three female justices. Justice Ginsburg said in an interview with The Washington Post that it would “change the public perception of where women are in the justice system. When the schoolchildren file in and out of the court and they look up and they see three women, then that will seem natural and proper — just how it is.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHer outspoken feminism played a role in Justice Ginsburg’s success. President Bill Clinton acknowledged that in 1993 when he nominated her to replace retiring Justice Byron White. At the time, she was a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Many admirers of her work say that she is to the women’s movement what former Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall was to the movement for the rights of African Americans,” Clinton said in Rose Garden ceremony. “I can think of no greater compliment to bestow on an American lawyer.”\\n\\n(Justice Ginsburg herself usually demurred when the comparison was made, saying that Marshall literally risked his life defending Black clients in the segregated South and that her legal work required no such sacrifice.)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn the court, Justice Ginsburg’s most notable rulings and dissents advanced feminist causes.\\n\\nIn 1996, she authored a groundbreaking decision ordering the Virginia Military Institute to admit women, ending a 157-year tradition of all-male education at the state-funded school.\\n\\nWhile Virginia “serves the state’s sons, it makes no provision whatever for her daughters. That is not equal protection,” Justice Ginsburg wrote in United States v. Virginia. The 7-to-1 decision — her friend, Scalia, was the dissenter — was the capstone of the legal battle for gender equality, she said later.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I regard the VMI case as the culmination of the 1970s endeavor to open doors so that women could aspire and achieve without artificial constraints,” Justice Ginsburg said after the decision.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLater in her career, discrimination against women was the theme of several forceful dissents Justice Ginsburg read from the bench, a sparingly used bit of theater that justices employ to emphasize deeply held disagreements with a majority opinion.\\n\\nAmong them was a protest of the court’s decision to uphold a federal ban on so-called partial-birth abortions. “The court deprives women of the right to make an autonomous choice, even at the expense of their safety,” Justice Ginsburg wrote. “This way of thinking reflects ancient notions about women’s place in the family and under the Constitution — ideas that have long since been discredited.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn another, she objected to a ruling that said workers may not sue their employers over unequal pay caused by discrimination alleged to have begun years earlier. That case had been filed by Lilly Ledbetter, the lone female supervisor at a tire plant in Gadsden, Ala., who sued after determining she was paid less than male co-workers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn an interview with The Post in 2010, Justice Ginsburg said the Ledbetter case struck a personal chord.\\n\\n“Every woman of my age had a Lilly Ledbetter story,” she said. “And so we knew that the notion that a woman who is in a nontraditional job is going to complain the first time she thinks she is being discriminated against — the one thing she doesn’t want to do is rock the boat, to become known as a complainer.”\\n\\nShe called upon Congress to take action, and once Democrats were in control, it did. Obama signed the law relaxing the deadlines for filing suits.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf the law is often complex, her view of equality was simple, she once said.\\n\\n“It has always been that girls should have the same opportunity to dream, to aspire and achieve — to do whatever their God-given talents enable them to do — as boys,” Justice Ginsburg said in a 2015 conversation at the American Constitution Society. “There should be no place where there isn’t a welcome mat for women. . . . That’s what it’s all about: Women and men, working together, should help make the society a better place than it is now.”\\n\\nBaton twirler and bookworm\\n\\nJoan Ruth Bader — her mother suggested using her middle name in kindergarten to avoid confusion with other Joans in the class — was born on March 15, 1933. She was the second daughter of Nathan Bader, a Jewish immigrant from Russia who became a furrier and haberdasher, and the former Celia Amster.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs a schoolgirl, Justice Ginsburg — known to friends as “Kiki” — was smart, popular and competitive, both a bookworm and a baton twirler. But her early life was also shadowed by tragedy. Her older sister, Marilyn, died of meningitis at age 8, leaving Justice Ginsburg to be raised as an only child. She later said she grew up “with the smell of death.”\\n\\nRaised in Flatbush, then a striving working-class neighborhood of Jewish, Italian and Irish immigrants in Brooklyn, Justice Ginsburg was molded largely by her mother, who had graduated from high school at 15. Her mother never went to college, instead taking a job to help her oldest brother through Cornell University.\\n\\nCelia Bader was determined that her daughter would have a different path. She stored away money given by her husband for personal expenses to establish a college tuition fund.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut tragedy struck again. By the time Justice Ginsburg was a teenager, her mother was battling cervical cancer. She died in 1950, on the day before Justice Ginsburg graduated near the top of her class from Brooklyn’s James Madison High School.\\n\\nBy the time Celia Bader died, the college fund was $8,000. But her daughter did not need it; she had won enough scholarships to cover her expenses. She ended up giving most of the money to her dad.\\n\\nJustice Ginsburg, like her uncle, attended Cornell, where on a blind date she met her future husband, Martin Ginsburg, a confident, fun-loving fraternity member and a standout on the university’s golf team. She later said he was the first boy she ever dated who cared about what was in her head.\\n\\nAfter graduation, Martin Ginsburg enrolled at Harvard Law School while Ruth completed her senior year, graduating first in her class in 1954.\\n\\nShortly after, they married. He was drafted into the Army, and the couple moved to Lawton, Okla., where Martin was stationed at Fort Sill. While Martin served his two-year hitch, Ruth took a civil service exam and came close to landing a good job at Lawton’s Social Security office.\\n\\nA problem emerged when she mentioned that she was pregnant. She was told that she would not be allowed to go Baltimore for training, forcing her to settle for a lower-paying job as a typist.\\n\\nAfter Martin’s Army discharge in 1956, the couple went to Cambridge, where Ruth also enrolled in Harvard Law, one of nine women in a class of more than 500.\\n\\nThose were the days of relentless grillings by professors using the Socratic method, a high-pressure situation made even more intense for female students by the prevailing view that they were operating in a realm where they did not belong.\\n\\nAt one point, Dean Erwin Griswold asked the women of the class what it felt like to occupy seats that could have gone to deserving men. (In 1993, on the eve of her Supreme Court confirmation, Griswold told the Harvard Crimson he long favored admitting women but that he had been overruled by the university’s governing board. He added that in asking women such a provocative question, he was playing devil’s advocate. “I think she completely misunderstood it and should have known better,” he said.)\\n\\nFurther complicating matters for Justice Ginsburg as a Harvard student was the responsibility of being a new mother after the birth of her daughter, Jane. (Jane eventually attended Harvard Law as well, one year behind future Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.)\\n\\nThrough it all, Justice Ginsburg was an academic star at Harvard. She earned top grades and a spot on the law review. But crisis soon invaded her life once again when her husband was diagnosed with testicular cancer. The prognosis was dire. “At the time, there were no known survivors,” Justice Ginsburg said.\\n\\nDoctors treated the ailment with both radiation and surgery. Justice Ginsburg collected carbon copies of class notes from Martin’s classmates, and she typed his papers as he dictated before turning to her own studies. Martin eventually recovered and after graduation snagged a job at a New York firm.\\n\\nIn 1958, Ruth transferred from Harvard to Columbia Law School to complete her legal training. There, she continued to thrive, again making the law review and tying for first in her class at graduation in 1959.\\n\\nOnce she started looking for work, she could not find a job at New York’s top firms.\\n\\n“I struck out on three grounds — I was Jewish, a woman and a mother,” Justice Ginsburg reflected later. “The first raised one eyebrow; the second, two; the third made me indubitably inadmissible.”\\n\\nNor could she land an interview for a clerkship with Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, despite a recommendation from a dean of Harvard Law School. Frankfurter made it clear that he simply wasn’t ready to hire a woman.\\n\\nEventually, she landed a position as a clerk for a federal district court judge, after a Columbia law professor lined up a man as a replacement in the event Justice Ginsburg faltered.\\n\\nAfter her clerkship, Justice Ginsburg signed on for a summer fellowship to study the legal system in Sweden. The six weeks in Stockholm proved to be an awakening, as she was thrust into the midst of that country’s burgeoning debate about gender roles in raising families.\\n\\nThe question was easily settled in Justice Ginsburg’s personal life, even as it roiled around her. She and Martin shared child rearing and household duties. She liked to tell the story of her response to receiving repeated calls from school administrators about discipline problems with her son, James.\\n\\nOn one “particularly weary” day, she told the school, “This child has two parents. I suggest you alternate calls, and it’s his father’s turn.”\\n\\nDuring her tenure on the court, Martin, a tax expert and later a Georgetown University Law School instructor who died in 2010, often baked cakes for justices’ birthday celebrations. He also was a reliable contributor to the spouse lunches and dinners held by the justices at the court.\\n\\nMartin Ginsburg once proposed this response to public requests for Justice Ginsburg’s “favorite recipe”: “The Justice was expelled from the kitchen nearly three decades ago by her food-loving children. She no longer cooks and the one recipe from her youth, tuna fish casserole, is nobody’s favorite.”\\n\\nA 'sparrow,' not a robin\\n\\nIn 1963, Justice Ginsburg became the second woman to join the faculty at New Jersey’s Rutgers Law School. There, her feminist awakening continued, even if she probably would not have described it that way.\\n\\nWhen Justice Ginsburg learned that her salary was lower than that of male colleagues, she joined an equal pay campaign with other female teachers, which resulted in raises for the women.\\n\\nWhile teaching at Rutgers, she also began taking on cases on behalf of the New Jersey branch of the ACLU. She battled successfully for maternity leave rights for teachers in New Jersey, who previously faced the threat of dismissal when they became pregnant.\\n\\nIn 1972, Justice Ginsburg became the first woman hired with tenure at Columbia Law School. Around that time, she also became the first director of the ACLU’s Women’s Rights Project.\\n\\nAt the ACLU, Justice Ginsburg led a team of lawyers that brought six cases before the Supreme Court between 1973 and 1979. They won five, victories that eventually altered the nation’s legal terrain by establishing that the constitutional guarantee of equal protection applied not only to racial minorities but to women as well.\\n\\nIn many ways, she was an unlikely revolutionary. Friends called her shy, and detractors and even her family said she could be humorless. But at times, she could be whimsical and was known to have a wry wit. Opera was her passion, and she said she would have been a diva instead of a justice if she’d had the voice of a robin instead “of a sparrow.”\\n\\nIn 1994, she and Scalia appeared in 18th-century costumes as extras in the Washington National Opera’s production of Richard Strauss’s “Ariadne auf Naxos.” Later, composer-librettist Derrick Wang took words from their opinions and put them to music in an opera called “Scalia/Ginsburg.” She often was asked why that order, instead of alphabetical?\\n\\nSeniority reigns at the Supreme Court, Ginsburg answered, and Scalia got there first.\\n\\nRoe and Clinton\\n\\nHer early victories at the Supreme Court prompted President Jimmy Carter to appoint her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 1980.\\n\\nOn an appeals court that often divided along ideological lines, Justice Ginsburg frequently straddled the middle. She dissented from the majority’s refusal to hear the case of an Air Force officer who wanted to wear a yarmulke while on duty, saying the prohibition reflected “callous indifference” to his religious faith.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Justice Ginsburg voted to dismiss a case brought by a gay sailor discharged from the Navy, and she voted against a minority set-aside program in O’Donnell Construction Co. v. District of Columbia. She developed enduring friendships with conservative jurists Scalia and Robert H. Bork while all three served on the appeals court.\\n\\nA strong supporter of abortion rights, Justice Ginsburg nonetheless alienated some of her erstwhile allies with a 1984 speech at the University of North Carolina, where she criticized the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in Roe v. Wade that guaranteed abortion rights.\\n\\nThe court’s 1973 ruling was too sweeping, she said, contributing to the divisive rancor that has accompanied the abortion issue ever since. She suggested that the court and the cause of abortion rights would have been better served had the court simply overturned the Texas law outlawing almost all abortions, which was at issue in the case.\\n\\nShe clarified her position in a 1993 lecture in which she argued that the justices should have grounded the right to abortion not in the concepts of “personal liberty” and “privacy” that spring from the 14th Amendment, but in the amendment’s equal protection clause.\\n\\nHer novel views on Roe created a significant hurdle for her ascension to the high court. After White announced his resignation in 1993, Justice Ginsburg, then 60, was among a large group of potential nominees placed before Clinton.\\n\\nJustice Ginsburg faced opposition from a new generation of women’s activists who, citing her abortion rights speeches and record as a moderate on the appeals court, argued that her views were too narrow and that time had passed her by.\\n\\nJustice Ginsburg also had her supporters, including her husband, who helped organize an effort that resulted in a torrent of letters and telephone calls to the White House that prompted Clinton to give her a second look. Clinton was also spurred on by Senate conservatives who pointed to Justice Ginsburg as a moderate that they could support, which appealed to Clinton’s New Democrat leanings. Clinton announced her nomination on June 14, 1993. She was confirmed just over two months later by a 96-to-3 vote.\\n\\nAfter the president announced her nomination, the normally reserved Ginsburg took time to thank a list of people and causes, including the civil rights and women’s movements, her husband and two children, her mother-in-law and first lady Hillary Clinton. Then, she offered one final tribute.\\n\\n“It is to my mother, Celia Amster Bader, the bravest and strongest person I have known, who was taken from me much too soon,” Justice Ginsburg said. “I pray that I may be all that she would have been had she lived in an age when women could aspire and achieve, and daughters are cherished as much as sons.”\\n\\nA prolific dissent writer\\n\\nJustice Ginsburg’s lot was to serve on a court with a majority more conservative than she was. As a result, she became much more known for her dissents than her majority opinions. More-moderate justices such as Sandra Day O’Connor, whom Justice Ginsburg greatly admired, and Kennedy often were the ones who wrote when the court was ideologically divided.\\n\\nJustice Ginsburg wrote a powerful dissent in one of the pivotal cases in her time on the court — Bush v. Gore — which resulted in George W. Bush’s win in the 2000 election. The majority criticized and then shut down a recount by Florida officials, which she would have allowed to continue.\\n\\n“Ideally, perfection would be the appropriate standard for judging the recount,” she wrote. “But we live in an imperfect world, one in which thousands of votes have not been counted. I cannot agree that the recount adopted by the Florida court, flawed as it may be, would yield a result any less fair or precise than the certification that preceded that recount.”\\n\\nWhen Justice John Paul Stevens retired in 2010, Justice Ginsburg became the senior justice among the court’s liberals: her fellow Clinton nominee Stephen G. Breyer and Obama’s choices for the court, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.\\n\\nUnder Justice Ginsburg’s direction, the liberals often answered major decisions with which they disagreed with one unified dissent. And they swallowed any differences they had with Kennedy to join him in a string of liberal victories at the court on same-sex marriage, affirmative action and abortion. (Justice Ginsburg later became the first justice to perform a same-sex marriage ceremony.)\\n\\nWhen the court in 2016 struck down Texas restrictions on doctors and abortion clinics, Kennedy assigned the majority opinion to Breyer. But Justice Ginsburg issued a rare concurrence to make the point that abortion rights remained — for now — firmly established.\\n\\nAs long as Roe remains good law, Justice Ginsburg wrote, laws that “do little or nothing for health, but rather strew impediments to abortion, cannot survive judicial inspection.”\\n\\nJustice Ginsburg did most of her work in dissents. She said she most lamented the court’s decisions in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission (2010), which opened the way for greater corporate and union spending in elections, and Shelby County v. Holder (2013), in which the court threw out a key provision of the civil rights-era Voting Rights Act of 1965.\\n\\nIn a famous passage, she faulted Roberts’s logic that restrictions on states with past desegregation needed to be justified anew.\\n\\n“Throwing out pre-clearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet,” she wrote.\\n\\nJustice Ginsburg sometimes drew attention for more than her legal opinions. Tiny and frail-looking, despite the fact that she worked out with a trainer and boasted of doing push-ups, photos of Justice Ginsburg falling asleep at the State of the Union address became the subject of news reports. She explained that it wasn’t fatigue; in fact, she was known as something of a night owl, working late. Instead, she said, Kennedy had brought a good bottle of wine to the dinner that the justices traditionally hold before crossing the street to the Capitol.\\n\\nJustice Ginsburg was also criticized for speaking too frankly in interviews and speeches, especially about abortion rights and same-sex marriage.\\n\\nShe drew criticism for surprisingly critical remarks about businessman Donald Trump, saying she feared for the court and the country if he were elected president. After several days of controversy, she issued a statement saying it was wrong of her to have commented about politics, but not apologizing for her views.\\n\\nDuring her court tenure, Justice Ginsburg had several bouts with cancer, although she never missed a day of the court’s public schedule.\\n\\nShe had colon cancer surgery in 1999, which was accompanied by precautionary chemotherapy and radiation treatment, but she never missed a day of oral arguments. And in February 2009, she underwent surgery for early-stage pancreatic cancer but managed to return to the bench when the court returned from recess less than three weeks later.\\n\\nInstead, cancer took her husband first. Again, she was on the bench the next day.\\n\\nIt was the final day of the court’s term, and she had an opinion to deliver. She thought of having another justice read the summary for her, but her children insisted she go herself, saying it was what their father would have wanted.\\n\\nJustice Ginsburg’s survivors include two children, Jane C. Ginsburg and James S. Ginsburg; four grandchildren; two step-grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.\\n\\nFletcher is a former Washington Post staff writer.\"}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/10/09/trump-nobel-peace-prize-foreing-allies/', 'Full Text': 'In 2018, a reporter asked him if he felt he deserved it. “Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it,” he responded.\\n\\n“I’m going to get a Nobel Prize for a lot of things — if they gave it out fairly, which they don’t,” Trump said in 2019.\\n\\n“Nobel Peace, can you imagine?” he asked in September — the same month he retweeted at least 12 different messages from supporters on the topic.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump’s unofficial, unorthodox quest for the prize has benefited from the help of far-flung foreign allies — including an anti-immigrant Norwegian politician and an Australian law professor best known for pro-monarchy campaigns — who ensure that he is nominated time and again.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEven prominent world leaders, including South Korea’s Moon Jae-in, Britain’s Boris Johnson and former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, have found themselves dragged into the effort.\\n\\nThis year, the White House itself released an official statement to announce that Trump had been nominated for the 2021 prize. The World Food Program was awarded the 2020 prize on Friday.\\n\\nSo far, Trump’s campaign for recognition in Oslo has earned him plenty of headlines, but borne no other fruit.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNobel trackers argue that the campaign of Trump and his supporters is doing him no favors. “Trump is so despised outside the U.S. that I cannot imagine the committee will spend any time on him at all,” Fredrik Heffermehl, a Norwegian peace activist, wrote in an email Thursday.\\n\\nThe U.S. presidents who have won the prize — Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama — did not make similar lobbying statements or seek the prize publicly, historians say.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRoosevelt’s nomination had been sponsored by “several American academics and several European diplomats for his efforts in mediating the end to the Russo-Japanese War,” said Stanley Wein, author of “Ambassador for Peace: How Theodore Roosevelt Won the Nobel Peace Prize.\"\\n\\nTrump’s history of nominations\\n\\nUnlike most other awards, the Nobel Peace Prize has a remarkably open system for nominations: Among the list of people who can nominate a person or group for a prize are university professors and national lawmakers. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was nominated in 1939.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee say that there were 318 candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020, of which 211 are individuals and 107 are organizations. It is not clear whether Trump was nominated this year — the deadline for nominations was Jan. 31 and the committee keeps nominees’ names secret for 50 years.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump’s initial entry into the nominations appears to have been unusual. Ahead of the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that the new U.S. president had been nominated twice, but the nominations were withdrawn after officials said they were fakes.\\n\\nTrump was subsequently nominated multiple times for the prize in 2019 because of his negotiations with North Korea, according to public statements from those who nominated him. Among those who announced they had nominated him were Christian Tybring-Gjedde and Per-Willy Amundsen, two Norwegian lawmakers with the populist, anti-immigration Progress Party, and a group of 18 Republican lawmakers from the United States.\\n\\nNot everyone who nominated Trump may have admitted it. In February 2019, Trump told reporters that Abe, then Japan’s prime minister, had given him “the most beautiful copy” of a letter nominating him for the prize. Abe, who sought a close relationship with Trump before retiring this year, never denied the account, instead telling lawmakers that he was “not saying it’s not true.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMoon suggested Trump should win the Nobel for talks with North Korea, though it is not clear whether the South Korean president nominated him, while Johnson, the British prime minister, suggested in 2018 that Trump would deserve a prize if he makes peace with North Korea and Iran.\\n\\nAlthough Trump did not win this year, there have been at least three nominations for him announced already for the 2021 prize. Tybring-Gjedde, who nominated Trump in 2018, wrote to Oslo in support of him again in September, citing the importance of a U.S.-brokered peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.\\n\\nWell-known for anti-immigrant and anti-Islam views in Norway, Tybring-Gjedde had previously stoked controversy for comparing the hijabs worn by Muslim women to robes worn by Ku Klux Klan members.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMagnus Jacobsson, a member for the center-right Christian Democrats in Sweden’s parliament, later announced he had nominated Trump for the prize because of U.S.-led peace talks between Kosovo and Serbia.\\n\\nA third nomination came shortly afterward from a group of Australian lawyers led by David Flint, an 82-year-old legal professor and monarchist campaigner whose eccentric comments have long earned him both fans and foes.\\n\\n“What he has done with the Trump Doctrine is that he has decided he would no longer have America in endless wars, wars which achieve nothing but the killing of thousands of young Americans,” Flint told Sky News Australia.\\n\\nAn unlikely prize\\n\\nDespite this praise, Trump-led negotiations in the Middle East and the Balkans have drawn some cautious reserve, with many arguing that they are small-scale and not the diplomatic breakthroughs Trump allies tout.

Here’s what demonstrations look like in some places that have implemented new restrictions.\\n\\nIsrael\\n\\nFor months, demonstrators have been gathering weekly in front of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence on Balfour Street in Jerusalem to protest a lengthy list of grievances against Israel’s longest-serving leader.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSigns focus on the corruption charges against Netanyahu. Chants call for him to step aside amid repeated election impasses and coalition-building standoffs. And people gather to register their frustrations with the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Critics accuse the prime minister of politicizing public health measures and failing to contain the economic fallout.\\n\\nAfter taking swift initial action to curb the virus this spring, Netanyahu pushed for a quick economic reopening this summer — and new cases have since climbed. So in early September, ahead of the Jewish high holidays, when many businesses close and families gather, Netanyahu ordered a sweeping, nationwide shutdown. Under the new rules, no groups of more than 20 people can gather, and no one can travel more than a kilometer (0.6 mile) from their home to attend a protest. That has not gone over well.\\n\\nDemonstrators condemned the measures as an attempt to silence protest. Others accused Netanyahu of capitulating to ultra-Orthodox leaders, who form a key part of his coalition and were frustrated that previous rules limited prayers but not protests.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSo far, demonstrations have continued nonetheless. Israelis have taken to their cars in motorcades bearing black flags, one of the symbols of the protests. Others gathered in front of Israel’s parliament when it debated and approved the new measure. Some groups are organizing synchronized local protests. On Thursday, some 1,000 demonstrations were held across the country, everywhere from street corners to bridges. Thousands of people joined demonstrations on Saturday, and about 15 people were arrested, the Reuters news agency reported.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Israel’s health minister said Tuesday that it’s unlikely the latest measures, originally slated to last three weeks, will be lifted soon.\\n\\nSpain\\n\\nSpain’s capital has opted for partial, localized shutdowns as coronavirus cases in the region — just months ago one of the hot spots of the pandemic in Europe — once again begin to rise.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSince Sept. 21, around 850,000 people in 37 hard-hit districts of Madrid have been unable to leave their neighborhoods except for work, school or for essential purposes such as to seek medical treatment. Within these zones, social gatherings are limited to six people, with fines in place for noncompliance.\\n\\nBut the communities in question are also predominantly lower-income and have high immigrant populations. The problem, community leaders say, is not the number of coronavirus cases alone, but also the lack of sufficient health provisions and economic opportunities to sustain people through the pandemic.\\n\\nOver the past two weeks, hundreds of people have defied local regulations and taken to the streets against policies they say discriminate against the poor. “No to a class-based lockdown,” rang one chant, the BBC reported. Others have used motorcade protests to bypass the restrictions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It is illogical that you can go and do things in wealthier areas, but you cannot do the same in [the neighborhood of] Vallecas,” Begona Ramos, 56, a protester in one of the locked-down neighborhoods, told Reuters. “There is the same risk of contagion. They are discriminating.”\\n\\nOn Friday, Spain’s government expanded the restrictions to include more than 3 million Madrid residents.

He resisted early calls for a lockdown and boasted that he shook hands with people at a hospital.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe prime minister was stricken in March, as coronavirus cases were rising exponentially in Britain. He announced his diagnosis on March 27 and then spent 10 days ravaged by fever, self-isolated in an apartment at 10 Downing Street.\\n\\nHis spinners told a nervous nation that the prime minister was “working hard” while in isolation, and was in “good spirits” even as he was wheeled into the hospital “for some routine tests.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the public sensed something more. Johnson looked like death warmed over. In a last video clip before he was hospitalized, his face was pale and puffy, blotched with sweat and fever.\\n\\nFinally, Johnson was ushered into an intensive care unit, to be kept alive by forced oxygen and the ministrations of a pair of immigrant nurses, “Jenny from New Zealand” and “Luis from Portugal,” Johnson said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab was tapped to stand in for Johnson, but there was a sense that the government was winging it, that decisions were being delayed pending the leader’s return. It was an anxious time, but not nearly as fraught as the current moment is for the United States, in the midst of the election.\\n\\nJohnson catching the virus didn’t boost support for his government — that surge came before Johnson was sick — but it did appear to give him a personal bump in the polls. Suddenly he wasn’t just the ambitious prime minister but a plump middle-aged bloke fighting for his life. The public wished him well.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJohnson’s popularity ratings this year peaked during the week he left the hospital, reaching a high of 60 percent, according to a YouGov survey. Those figures have since slumped, with a poll this week showing that opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer has higher favorability ratings than Johnson.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe nation — and close political observers — are divided over what Johnson’s brush with death, at age 55, did to the man and the leader.\\n\\nSome thought it made him more empathetic; others see him as weakened.\\n\\nPerhaps surprisingly, some of the harshest criticism of Johnson these days comes from members of the libertarian wing of his Conservative Party, who worry that the jolly old Johnson is now beset, like some past English king or a Shakespeare character, by dark clouds and portents of doom.\\n\\nToby Young, writing in the Spectator, where Johnson once served as editor in chief, quoted a friend saying that surviving a near-death experience can affect people in one of two ways.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Either you become more devil-may-care, thinking it could all end at any moment so why not live life to the full; or you become super-cautious, having been left feeling vulnerable by your brush with mortality,” Young wrote. “According to that armchair psychologist, Boris has gone through door number two.”\\n\\nThe Daily Telegraph, another former Johnson employer, is filled with columns questioning his \\xadvirility and grit, suggesting that the English bulldog has become the whipped dog, intimidated by \\xadnanny-state medicos and fearmongering epidemiologists.\\n\\nYoung wrote, “A less generous theory is that the disease actually damaged his brain in some way — and there is some evidence that cognitive decline can lower your appetite for risk. Whether the damage was psychological or physiological, the implication is clear: he’s no longer fit to be prime minister and should step down as soon as he’s got Brexit done.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnand Menon, a professor of European politics at King’s College London, told The Washington Post that “it’s very, very hard to tell” how Johnson may have been influenced by getting the virus. He noted that Johnson and his partner, Carrie Symonds, had a baby boy at the end of April, only two weeks after he came out of the hospital.\\n\\n“You could [attribute] some of the things he seemed to do as a result of coronavirus — his anti-obesity drive or the warmth in which he spoke about the National Health Service — to his fatherhood or to his illness. It’s hard, unless you’re a good friend of his, to know what is what,” he said.\\n\\nSome have questioned whether Johnson’s hours of lying prone, having oxygen pressed into his lungs, influenced any major changes on his policies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSteven Fielding, a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham, said that if it had, “it’s not observable.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“If he wanted to dramatize the necessity of following rules, Dominic Cummings would not be working for him,” he said, referring to Johnson’s top aide who was accused of breaking lockdown rules by driving across the country with wife and son while he was sick.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/trump-cuts-refugee-cap/2020/10/01/a5113b62-03ed-11eb-8879-7663b816bfa5_story.html', 'Full Text': 'The 15,000 figure, the lowest since the 1980 Refugee Act took effect, is a drop from the 2020 cap that was set at 18,000.

Fewer than 12,000 refugees have arrived in the past 12 months, statistics show.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKrish O’Mara Vignarajah, CEO of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services, called the 15,000 cap an “abdication” of the nation’s humanitarian leadership role in the world.\\n\\n“This absurdly low number is based on nothing more than xenophobic political pandering, and it’s no surprise that this all-time low comes during an election year,” Vignarajah said.\\n\\nWhite House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who wields broad influence over U.S. immigration policy, has long argued that refugee admission levels should be set in accordance with the volume of asylum claims from migrants who arrive seeking humanitarian protections.\\n\\nWhile the refugee program is administered primarily through the State Department and is available to applicants in conflict zones and other imperiled locations abroad, the asylum program is available to those already present on U.S. soil who claim a fear of harm if returned to their native countries.\\n\\nA surge of claims at the Mexico border during the past five years has worsened a backlog of pending cases in U.S. immigration courts that now exceeds 1 million.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe notice, issued jointly with the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services, said the United States “anticipates receiving more than 300,000 new refugees and asylum claims in Fiscal Year 2021,” introducing a numerical projection of anticipated asylum claims. “Of that number, up to 15,000 would be refugees admitted through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and more than 290,000 would be individuals in new asylum cases.”\\n\\nNotably, the statement does not say that 290,000 asylum seekers will be allowed to stay in the United States. That decision rests with U.S. immigration courts. Instead, the figure appears to be a projection of how many asylum claims the United States expects to receive.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has all but shut the door to new asylum applicants during the past six months, adopting emergency enforcement measures that allow U.S. agents to rapidly “expel” 90 percent of border-crossers back to Mexico.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Since the beginning of the pandemic, the administration has attempted to achieve much of its anti-immigration agenda under the guise of a public health rationale, but it’s a bad-faith excuse,” Vignarajah said.\\n\\n“We have shown as we have resettled thousands of refugees that there’s no evidence any of these arrivals have endangered Americans,” she said. “Refugees come to this country after the most extreme vetting procedures, including medical-health checks.”\\n\\nFor more than a half-century, U.S. politicians from both parties have generally spoken favorably of refugees as a benefit to the country, people who bring fresh ideas, entrepreneurialism and patriotic fervor. Donald Trump is the first president in the modern era to depict them as a threat and a burden.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnder previous Republican and Democratic administrations, the refugee cap typically exceeded 70,000 a year, and Trump challenger Joe Biden has pledged to set the figure at 125,000 per year if elected.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“This inexcusable new admissions ceiling is a mere fraction of the number of refugees the United States can and should resettle in a year,” Isra Chaker, of Oxfam America, said in a statement condemning the State Department notice. “During the final year of the previous administration, the U.S. safely and successfully resettled an average of 15,000 refugees every two months.”\\n\\nTrump administration officials have reframed the goal of the refugee program to conform with Miller’s view that those seeking humanitarian protections should remain in temporary housing outside the United States until they can safely return to their countries. “We are working to assist refugees and other displaced people as close to their homes as possible until they can safely and voluntarily return to rebuild their lives, their communities, and their countries,” the State Department’s notice to Congress said.\\n\\nThe notification also framed the lowered cap as a public health decision. “The President’s proposal for refugee resettlement in Fiscal Year 2021 reflects the Administration’s continuing commitment to prioritize the safety and well-being of Americans, especially in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” it said.\\n\\nTrump administration officials insist that the United States remains a generous and welcoming country, an assertion Secretary of State Mike Pompeo repeated during a visit to Italy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“We continue to be the single-greatest contributor to the relief of humanitarian crisis all around the world,” Pompeo said. “We will continue to do so, certainly so long as President Trump is in office.”\\n\\nThe president’s campaign speeches veer from that view, most recently in Minnesota, where he told supporters Wednesday that Biden was planning to “inundate your state with a historic flood of refugees.” He paused to allow the boos and jeers to resonate.\\n\\nThe president told supporters that Biden “will turn Minnesota into a refugee camp, overwhelming public resources, overcrowding schools and inundating your hospitals,” by bringing foreigners “from the most dangerous countries in the world, including Yemen, Syria, and your favorite country, Somalia.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMinnesota has resettled thousands of refugees from war-torn countries, including Somalia, the birthplace of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), one of the president’s most frequent targets for attack.\\n\\nTrump belittled Omar in the speech for “telling us how to run our country,” using language typical of authoritarian governments that attempt to stigmatize minorities and depict non-White citizens as foreigners.

The first financial filings shared with investors ahead of the offering revealed Palantir’s business is concentrated among a handful of loyal customers, raising questions about whether it can scale up the same way as other tech outfits.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe records show that Palantir has just 125 corporate and government customers, a relatively small number for a large, publicly-traded tech company. Two-thirds of its revenue comes from its top 20 customers, raising concerns that it could lose business as long-running government contracts are renegotiated. It generated an average revenue per customer of $24.8 million last year.\\n\\nTo some, the surprising concentration of Palantir’s customer base shows the limits of its business. Palantir’s reliance on that insular market could make it a risky bet for many investors, said Rohit Kulkarni, a senior analyst at MKM Partners in San Francisco.\\n\\n“The company is still almost at the mercy of a small number of government contracts,” Kulkarni said. “If and when they come up for renewal, the investment community will get extremely spooked about how those negotiations go.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOthers see it as a sign that Palantir still has room to grow. Palantir chief operating officer Shyam Sankar said the company is just beginning to build out a modern sales operation and hired its first formal salesperson last year.\\n\\n“It shows you how much headroom we have in front of us ... we have six customers in the Fortune 100 and 94 more to go,\" Sankar said. “We have a way of building deep, meaningful relationships … its what you expect if you aspire to be the central operating system of an institution.\"\\n\\nNamed for a mysterious black orb that a dark wizard uses to communicate with a giant disembodied flaming eye in J.R.R. Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings” trilogy, Palantir has long been one of Silicon Valley’s most closely held secrets. It was founded in 2004 by billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel with financial help from the CIA and has stayed private far longer than many observers thought it would.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhile government contracts make up more than half of its revenue, it has attempted to recent years to build new lines of business serving corporate customers. Today, its algorithms, sporting names such as “Gotham” and “Foundry,” are applied to problems as high-stakes as spotting terrorists and as mundane as analyzing payroll.\\n\\nSome of Palantir’s contracts with the U.S. government have been a lightning rod for human-rights activists and its own employees. It has a lucrative partnership with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, providing digital profiling tools to the federal agency as it carried out President Trump’s policies for apprehending and deporting undocumented immigrants. The company acknowledged in its filing with securities regulators that some of its contracts have made it a target for protests, but did not detail any of its work with ICE.\\n\\nPalantir has also nosed its way into the Defense Department’s information technology industry, capitalizing on efforts to modernize the department’s technology to compete with foreign nations such as Russia and China. In an $800 million coup for its military business, Palantir in 2019 beat out Raytheon to become the primary provider for the Army’s battlefield intelligence system.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat sort of work is expected to take on a higher profile in the future as the U.S. military seeks to rely more heavily on artificial-intelligence algorithms and unmanned weapons systems.\\n\\nPalantir doubtlessly has more room to grow as it seeks to expand its military work. It recently tacked on a $110 million contract to manage an Army personnel system, and won in March an $80 million contract for a complex Navy logistics system. And on Tuesday it was awarded yet another Army contract, this one a $91 million opportunity to research new ways that artificial intelligence algorithms can be integrated into how military agencies make decisions.\\n\\nStill, there is a concern that the company’s long-term market could be limited.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPalantir’s typical corporate customer is a large, multinational company with huge amounts of data. While Palantir has emphasized its opportunity to expand within these companies — aiming to become “a central operating system” for their data — it will eventually run out of giant global companies to sell to.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBrendan Burke, an analyst at venture capital industry research firm PitchBook, said he thinks investors have valued Palantir as if it were an enterprise software company. But its financials suggest it is primarily in the government contracting business.\\n\\n“It’s clearly not an enterprise software company with government customers,” Burke said. “It is a government contractor that is expanding and transferring some of its lessons to the private sector.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPalantir is still growing revenue rapidly like a tech company, but because it invests heavily in sales and marketing, its profit margins are below typical software companies. At about $20 billion, Palantir would be valued in line with other business software makers such as Splunk and Elastic. At that price, public market investors would be betting the company can find new avenues of growth.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It has achieved high growth. I think investors expect high growth to continue,” Burke said.\\n\\nPitchbook analyst Mark Cash said he expects the company’s margins to more closely emulate that of a software company over time, adding that it has shifted away from being purely a government consultant and now more closely resembles a software company.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“We view Palantir as a land-and-expand operation: a lot of upfront investments can be needed to land a customer, but incremental revenue starts outpacing costs as more subscriptions are added per customer, over time,” Cash said in an email.\\n\\nEric Munsun, a technology investor whose Adit Ventures firm invested in Palantir in 2014, said he thinks Palantir can double its customer base and its revenue in the next 18 months.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/trump-history-education/2020/09/17/f40535ec-ee2c-11ea-ab4e-581edb849379_story.html', 'Full Text': \"The federal government has no power over the curriculum taught in local schools. Nonetheless, Trump said he would create a national commission to promote a “pro-American curriculum that celebrates the truth about our nation’s great history,” which he said would encourage educators to teach students about the “miracle of American history.”\\n\\nTrump is calling the panel the “1776 Commission,” in what appeared to be a barb at the New York Times’s 1619 Project. The project, whose creator won a Pulitzer Prize for its lead essay, is a collection of articles and essays that argue that the nation’s true founding year is 1619, the year enslaved Africans were brought to the shores of what would become the United States. Trump said Thursday the 1619 Project wrongly teaches that the United States was founded on principles of “oppression, not freedom.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Patriotic moms and dads are going to demand that their children are no longer fed hateful lies about this country,” he said. “American parents are not going to accept indoctrination in our schools, cancel culture at work or the repression of traditional faith, culture and values in the public square. Not anymore.”\\n\\nAs he campaigns for reelection, Trump has repeatedly cast education that examines the nation’s failures as a betrayal, seeking to rally his base and tap into hostility toward protesters who have taken to the streets to denounce racial injustice and police brutality.\\n\\nHis argument casts any criticism of the United States, even of slavery, as unpatriotic. It stands in sharp contrast to American leaders such as President Barack Obama, who spoke more frankly of the nation’s shortcomings, painting it as a country constantly striving to perfect itself.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump’s speech Thursday was a continuation of a message he has pushed since the Fourth of July, when he declared at Mount Rushmore, under the gaze of George Washington and other titans of the presidency, that children are “taught to hate their own country” in public schools.\\n\\nIn a lengthy speech to the Republican National Convention, he pledged to “fully restore patriotic education.” And last month, when reflecting on the unrest that had erupted in U.S. cities over police brutality, he also blamed schools.\\n\\n“What we’re witnessing today is a result of left-wing indoctrination in our nation’s schools and universities,” Trump said at a news conference. “Many young Americans have been fed lies about America being a wicked nation plagued by racism.”\\n\\nAmerican roots\\n\\nYet educators and students say that Trump is wildly out of touch with what happens in public school classrooms, where the United States is still held up as a beacon of freedom and democracy, and a moral leader.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump’s gambit seeks to turn local schools — already beset by a global pandemic and many other problems — into another front in the culture war he champions, positioning history teachers as opponents of American greatness along with kneeling football players, police misconduct protesters and racial-sensitivity trainers. It fits neatly into his argument that presidential rival Joe Biden and other Democrats want to “Abolish the American Way of Life,” as Trump tweeted in July.\\n\\nThe president also has worked to rewrite what federal employees learn in racial sensitivity training. The White House compelled agencies to cancel trainings that mentioned the words “White privilege” or frame the United States as “an inherently racist or evil country.”\\n\\nTrump’s campaign defending American history arrived as protests against police brutality and racial injustice began roiling the country. While many Americans work to reckon with the nation’s racist past, Trump and other conservatives are working to preserve a narrative that casts the United States as a moral leader, as virtuous and as exceptional.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTheir efforts sometimes overlap with those who seek to preserve monuments to Confederate military leaders and who cast them as heroes despite their fight to preserve the institution of slavery.\\n\\nOn Thursday, Trump said he would erect a statue of Caesar Rodney, who cast the tie-breaking vote to declare independence from Britain in 1776, in a “National Garden of American Heroes” that he hopes to establish. Rodney was also a enslaver, and a statue of him was removed from a city square in Wilmington, Del., in June.\\n\\nFor many on the right, any narrative that challenges American exceptionalism is by default, anti-American.\\n\\n“Instead of emphasizing that America was built on slavery, we emphasize that America was built on liberty,” said Noah Weinrich, spokesman for Heritage Action, the lobbying arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOthers say that leaves out the nation’s history of inhumane treatment of Black Americans, women and immigrants.\\n\\n“They don’t want us talking too much about America’s flaws,” said Albert L. Samuels, chair of the history and political science department at Southern University. “Let’s not deal with the fact that many of the framers were slaveholders.”\\n\\n'Ghosts of our country's past'\\n\\nFor schools, the pressure campaign is more about politics and the bully pulpit than federal policy. What issues get taught in classrooms are “always local decisions,” said Arne Duncan, who served as education secretary under Obama.\\n\\nWhen it comes to setting curriculums, Trump “has no ability to do that. He’s a fraud.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Trump’s line of attack is part of a decades-long thread of conservative activism targeting public schools, said Andrew Hartman, an Illinois State University professor of history who studies culture wars. Conservative parent activists have attacked schools for teaching sex education they regard as immoral, for example, or assigning books they view as too lurid.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“This has become a bedrock of the conservative movement since the ’70s — that the public schools are secular, that the public schools are liberal or even radical and that the public schools are destroying the fabric of America,” Hartman said.\\n\\nAlbert Broussard, a professor at Texas A&M who specializes in Afro-American history and has written history textbooks, viewed Trump’s comments less as a serious policy proposal and more as an effort to stoke his base. Broussard believes it’s a backlash against recent efforts to present a more varied narrative of U.S. history.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Trump plays to this idea of White grievance and White fear and White insecurity,” Broussard said. “The country’s population has changed racially and ethnically . . . I think that will continue to provoke anxiety among some people.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEducators expressed bewilderment with many of the president’s comments.\\n\\n“I am not teaching my students to hate America,” said Chris Dier, a high school teacher in Louisiana who was the state’s 2020 teacher of the year. “We are teaching our students to embrace our country, even the things that are negative. We’re choosing not to ignore the ghosts of our country’s past.”\\n\\nEmma Chan, a 16-year-old student at a New Jersey private school who has had her history research published in a student journal, said her history courses had inspired neither love nor hate for her country. It was more complicated than that.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I don’t think that there’s anything that’s so perfect or so evil that we can exclusively love or hate it,” Chan said, “especially with something as complex as a country with a history that’s so convoluted.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTo her, casting criticism of the United States as unpatriotic is unfair.\\n\\n“You can love a country and feel it’s worth defending and still criticize it,” Chan said. “I think pressing for change is a patriotic thing to do.”\\n\\nBroadening education\\n\\nTrump’s fight for schools to emphasize American exceptionalism is running up against efforts by students and teachers to include more voices and perspectives in history education. Students have rallied around the country to urge their schools to teach more Black history, and to assign more books by Black authors.\\n\\nAmina Salahou, a rising senior at Nottingham High in Syracuse, N.Y., is part of a campaign to “decolonize education.” As the daughter of African immigrants, she complained her history courses have been too myopic.\\n\\n“We definitely just learned about White America,” Salahou said. On the contrary, Salahou and other students want to see courses that highlight the achievement and contributions of Black Americans and feature the voices of marginalized people.\\n\\n“Decolonization curriculum means advocating for greater or equal representation of different perspectives,” Salahou said. “It means giving students a chance to see themselves in history.”\\n\\nIt is not the first time that debates over what is taught in history class have drawn national politicians into the fight. The College Board, which administers exams for Advanced Placement courses, in 2014 decided to update the framework it provided to those teaching its Advanced Placement United States History course.\\n\\nThe changes led to an explosive debate between conservative and liberal factions of school boards. It also drew the attention of the Republican National Committee, which condemned it because it “emphasizes negative aspects of our nation’s history while omitting or minimizing positive aspects.” Conservative Ben Carson, now the secretary of housing and urban development, told an audience in 2014 that by the time students finish the course, “they’d be ready to sign up for ISIS.”\\n\\n“A whole section of slavery and how evil we are. A whole section about Japanese internment camps. A whole section about how we wiped out American Indians with no mercy,” Carson said.\\n\\nEducators said they have begun teaching a more inclusive version of history not because it’s mandated but because it’s what students want. Jennifer Hitchcock, a high school teacher in Virginia, once assigned an account by a Filipino soldier battling U.S. occupation during the Spanish-American War, describing what Filipinos endured as American forces attempted to pacify the island. Students were transfixed and wanted to know more.\"}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/09/22/thanks-trumps-actions-millions-lose-health-coverage/', 'Full Text': 'Now, the question: Do you think health coverage went up or down in the years leading up to the current pandemic?\\n\\nBased on those facts, you would probably say “up.” You would be wrong. According to Census Bureau data, coverage has declined to the point where nearly 1 in 10 people in the United States — 9.2 percent, or more than 29 million people — lacked health insurance last year (see Figure 1). More Americans were uninsured in 2019 than in 2018, the third year in a row both the number and share who are uninsured have increased. That’s a sharp reversal from 2016’s historic low uninsured rate of 8.6 percent, according to analysis by our colleagues Aviva Aron-Dine and Matt Broaddus at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\\n\\nHow could those two facts — the ACA remains in place and the job market tightened significantly over the past few years — square with the reality of declining coverage? It’s neither a mystery nor an accident: Despite the ACA’s historic expansion of health coverage to millions of Americans, the Trump administration has taken steps limiting access to comprehensive health coverage.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe pandemic has underscored the recklessness of this sabotage. Because of the administration’s attacks on health coverage, the United States entered the pandemic with 2.3 million more uninsured people than in 2016, including 700,000 more uninsured children.\\n\\nThe administration’s attack has been relentless and multifaceted. It has encouraged states to restrict Medicaid coverage, including taking coverage away from people who don’t meet harsh work requirements or pay premiums or who miss paperwork deadlines. The administration has also sown fear among families with immigrants that enrolling in Medicaid or Marketplace health coverage could prevent them or their family members from remaining legally in the United States.\\n\\nThat’s apart from the Trump administration’s attempts to repeal the ACA as a whole. The latest attempt — a lawsuit in which the administration and 18 Republican attorneys general are asking the Supreme Court to strike down the entire law — may still succeed, particularly given the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. If the ACA is struck down, some 20 million people would lose their health coverage, and millions more with preexisting conditions could be charged more or denied coverage altogether.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat’s especially perverse is that even as the administration continues attacking Medicaid, more and more research documents that program’s positive impacts. The ACA’s expansion of Medicaid to low-income adults saved the lives of more than 19,000 adults between the ages of 55 and 64 between 2014 and 2017, research has shown — while the states that rejected expansion have seen more than 15,000 older adults die prematurely. Medicaid coverage also improves families’ financial security, reduces the likelihood that people will skip needed medical care or medications due to cost and increases the share of people reporting excellent health.\\n\\nMedicaid’s role has only grown due to the pandemic and economic crisis. States are leaning on Medicaid as the backbone of their public health infrastructure, expanding home- and community-based benefits and improving access to testing and treatment. As unemployment remains elevated, people who have lost job-based coverage are relying on Medicaid for access to care.\\n\\nAmericans recognize Medicaid’s importance. Across party lines, voters have a far more favorable view of Medicaid than they do of their representatives in Congress. This summer, voters in the traditionally red states of Oklahoma and Missouri approved ballot initiatives to expand Medicaid to hundreds of thousands of low-income adults.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStates and the federal government must act quickly to reverse the destructive trend of climbing uninsurance rates. States should continue to strengthen and expand coverage through Medicaid, rejecting the Trump administration’s path of greater restrictions. Congress should support states’ covid-19 response by further increasing the federal share of Medicaid funding (the program is jointly financed by states and the federal government). This would provide not only essential coverage but also economic stimulus to states, which could then spend freed-up health-care dollars on other needs.\\n\\nThe ACA isn’t perfect, but it triggered a decline in uninsured rates that is one of the most important policy successes in decades. It delivered a level of security to millions of families who formerly lived in fear of being bankrupted by an unforeseen illness. It also made them healthier by enabling them to get preventive care and family health services.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/17/two-new-polls-show-damage-trump-has-done-us-foreign-policy/', 'Full Text': 'Part of the decline is due to Trump’s egregious mishandling of the coronavirus. Only 15 percent of respondents give the United States good marks on the pandemic. China’s handling of the pandemic is more than twice as popular, even though that’s where the virus originated. Trump himself is intensely unpopular — more so even than Russia’s Vladimir Putin or China’s Xi Jinping. Eighty-three percent of respondents in U.S. allies have no confidence in America’s president. Only 16 percent trust him to do what is right in world affairs. In short, Trump has turned the United States into a global pariah.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA new survey out Thursday from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs offers some heartening news by showing that most Americans reject Trump’s isolationist, protectionist policies. Sixty-two percent say that the lesson of covid-19 is that we need to “coordinate and collaborate with other countries to solve global issues.” Sixty-eight percent say it would be better “for the future of the country if we take an active part in world affairs.” Sixty-five percent say that globalization is “mostly good” for the United States.\\n\\nBut while the majority of the public is in favor of free trade, alliances and international leadership — the traditional pillars of America’s post-1945 foreign policy — Republicans have turned more negative on all of these policies under Trump’s pernicious influence. The percentage of Republicans who support globalization has dropped from 62 percent in 2014 to 55 percent. Now 58 percent of Republicans say that America needs to be self-sufficient; only 18 percent of Democrats agree. Republican support for NATO (60 percent) is 25 percentage points lower than among Democrats (85 percent); that’s the lowest level of GOP support since the question was first asked in 1974. Less than half of Republicans support defending NATO allies such as Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia from a Russian invasion and a slight majority approve of Trump’s troop cuts in Germany. A third want even steeper troop withdrawals.\\n\\nPartisan differences are especially stark when respondents were asked about critical threats to the United States. Seventy-five percent of Democrats cited climate change vs. 21 percent of Republicans. Fifty-seven percent of Democrats cited Russian power vs. 40 percent of Republicans. And only 13 percent of Democrats cited “large numbers of immigrants and refugees coming into the U.S.” vs. 61 percent of Republicans.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDemocrats want to address the United States’ internal problems and take an internationalist approach to foreign policy. Republicans favor a nationalist, unilateralist approach while denying that America needs to address serious flaws such as racial or income inequality. Eighty percent of Republicans say that the United States is “the greatest country in the world,” compared to only 35 percent of Democrats, down from 60 percent in 2014.\\n\\nI’m not overly concerned about Republicans’ Pollyanna-ish pride in America, exaggerated though it may be at this low point in our history. What I am alarmed about is that three times as many Republicans say that immigration is a critical threat (the question did not specify illegal immigration) than say the same of global warming. I am also concerned that Republicans are far more friendly toward Russia, and far more hostile to NATO, than they used to be. The Trump influence is clear — and it will outlast his presidency.\\n\\nThe good news buried in the findings is that a significant number of Republicans haven’t adopted the “America First” mind-set: Roughly 40 percent still see Russia as a critical threat and 60 percent still support NATO despite Trump’s incessant praise for Putin and criticism of our allies. Most independents are closer to the Democrats than they are Republicans on foreign policy. This suggests that, if Joe Biden is elected, he has the potential to pursue an internationalist foreign policy that will win overwhelming support from the general public, if not from a significant number of Republicans.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/10/09/ice-black-jogger-boston-investigation/', 'Full Text': 'Apreala, who noticed one of the officers was wearing an Immigration and Customs Enforcement badge, questioned why he’d been stopped since he’s a U.S. citizen.

Here are some of the biggest October surprises from the past.\\n\\n1840 — This was a wild election year. The challenger, war hero William Henry Harrison, held huge rallies where women stumped for him (gasp!) decades before they had the right to vote. The incumbent, Martin Van Buren, had been dubbed “Martin Van Ruin” because of an economic downturn during his term. But he had a secret weapon, according to Politico: Federal prosecutors allied with Van Buren learned of a voter fraud plot by members of Harrison’s Whig Party. The feds waited until mid-October to arrest the conspirators, hoping the headlines would give Van Buren an edge. It didn’t work. Harrison won in an electoral landslide. But a few months later, there was an “April surprise” when Harrison died shortly after taking office.\\n\\n1880 — Every presidential election in this decade had an October surprise. In 1880, it was the so-called Morey letter — a forged missive supposedly written by Republican candidate James A. Garfield in which he appeared to support Chinese immigration. This was a problem because White voters in the Western states had the racist idea Chinese immigrants were stealing their jobs. Garfield took a while to denounce the letter because he couldn’t remember if he had written it or not, as Atlas Obscura recounted in 2017. Garfield lost California but still won the election by one of the narrowest margins in history. He was assassinated a few months into his term.\\n\\n1884 — Republican James G. Blaine was supposed to have this election in the bag. But on Oct. 29, during an event he attended, a minister said Democrats represented “rum, Romanism and rebellion.” (Translation: Drinkers, Catholics and Confederates.) Blaine later claimed he didn’t hear the comment, but Democratic spies sure did. Soon “the three Rs” had been published in every paper. On election night, it all hinged on New York, which was a swing state at the time. Irish Catholics showed up in droves for Blaine’s opponent, Grover Cleveland, handing him the presidency.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n1888 — Cleveland may have benefited from someone else’s foolish remarks in 1884, but four years later it was his undoing. As The Washington Post’s Robert Mitchell explained, a California political junkie sent a prank letter to the British ambassador to the United States asking for whom he should vote. The ambassador — quite unwisely — wrote back, saying Cleveland was the empire’s favorite. On Oct. 21, newspapers published the response; even the appearance of a foreign power weighing in on domestic politics was a scandal. Cleveland won the popular vote but lost the electoral college, and with it the election.\\n\\n1968 — This October surprise was an unsuccessful attempt to help Democrat Hubert Humphrey. On Oct. 31, outgoing president Lyndon B. Johnson announced an end to bombing runs in North Vietnam, hinting that the war might be coming to an end. Republican Richard M. Nixon still trounced Humphrey.\\n\\n1972 — Four years later, Nixon tried the same October surprise that was used against him. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger held a news conference in which he declared “peace is at hand” in Vietnam. (It wasn’t.) Nixon probably would have won anyway, but the announcement sure helped distract from the budding Watergate scandal.\\n\\n1980 — This one is still the mother of all October surprises and most likely the election from which the term was coined, according to Smithsonian Magazine. Democratic president Jimmy Carter was working hard to get American hostages in Iran freed before Election Day. In late October, Iran suddenly cut off talks, helping Republican Ronald Reagan defeat the incumbent. Iranian officials released the hostages minutes after Reagan was inaugurated in January 1981, leading to conspiracy theories that the Reagan camp had a secret deal with Iran. Congressional investigations found no evidence of this, but Iranian officials said it was true. In 2017, historians claimed to have found evidence that confirmed at least part the conspiracy theory.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n2000 — This was technically a November surprise — and only hinted at the drama to come — but days before the 2000 presidential election, Fox News revealed Republican candidate George W. Bush had been arrested for drunken driving in 1976. Bush strategist Karl Rove suspected an aide to Democratic candidate Al Gore for leaking it. Bush still became president, but Rove later claimed it cost Bush five states and triggered the post-election drama that had Bush and Gore essentially tied.\\n\\n2004 — Bush and his Democratic rival John F. Kerry were neck and neck in the polls. Then on Oct. 29, a video of Osama bin Laden surfaced in which the terrorist mocked Bush. Turns out being condemned by a terrorist is kind of like an endorsement; a Newsweek poll showed Bush suddenly had a six-point lead on the eve of the election.\\n\\n2012 — Some say Hurricane Sandy doesn’t qualify as an October surprise since it wasn’t caused by humans, but photos of Obama shaking hands with Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie were a boon for the incumbent days before voters went to the polls. Challenger Mitt Romney later told Fox News it could have cost him the election, but “I’ve been a governor, and I know what happens when there’s been a national disaster — and that is, you look for help from the federal government.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n2016 — There were so many October surprises in this election, it can be hard to tell which, if any, made a difference. Was it the New York Times story that Trump had avoided taxes? Or The Washington Post release of the “Access Hollywood” tape of Trump admitting to sexual assault? Or what about when WikiLeaks released the hacked emails from the Clinton campaign? According to polling analysis by FiveThirtyEight, the October surprise that had the most effect was FBI Director James B. Comey’s Oct. 28 letter to Congress that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was under investigation. It cost her three or four points in the polls — enough that she lost the electoral college while taking the popular vote by nearly 3 million.\\n\\nLast month, some suggested the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the October surprise coming early. Since then, there have been more Trump tax revelations from the New York Times, the president’s covid-19 diagnosis, his trip to the hospital, his dramatically staged return to the White House, his announcement that stimulus talks with Democrats are off and now his address from the balcony.\\n\\nIf past is prologue, we aren’t close to done with October surprises.\\n\\nRobert Mitchell contributed to this report.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-woodward-coronavirus-panic/2020/09/10/5376cd7c-f375-11ea-999c-67ff7bf6a9d2_story.html', 'Full Text': '“I don’t want to jump up and down and start screaming ‘Death! Death!’ because that’s not what it’s all about. We have to lead a country,” Trump said. He added, “There has to be a calmness.”\\n\\nTrump evidently did not feel the same presidential obligation to imbue serenity a few hours earlier, however, when he sounded the alarm on Twitter about a number of other topics.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“If I don’t win, America’s Suburbs will be OVERRUN with Low Income Projects, Anarchists, Agitators, Looters and, of course, ‘Friendly Protesters,’ ” Trump tweeted Thursday morning.\\n\\nIn another morning tweet, he wrote, “Sending out 80 MILLION BALLOTS to people who aren’t even asking for a Ballot is unfair and a total fraud in the making. Look at what’s going on right now!”\\n\\nThroughout his five years on the national political stage, Trump has used fear to acquire and keep power. Scare tactics are the hammer and screwdriver of his tool kit.\\n\\nTrump famously launched his presidential campaign in 2015 with dark warnings that immigrants from Mexico were “rapists” and “bringing drugs” and “bringing crime.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs president, he has warned darkly — and with considerable hyperbole — of dangers he sees everywhere. At first, it was citizens of majority-Muslim countries bringing terror to the shores of the United States. Then it was MS-13 gang members overtaking tranquil communities. Then it was “caravans” of “illegal aliens” traveling through Central America toward the U.S.-Mexico border. Then it was “un-American” Democrats trying to steal everyone’s guns, obliterate the economy and destroy the country by instituting socialism.\\n\\nThis summer, as polls have shown Trump trailing Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, the president has warned of a “RIGGED 2020 ELECTION … IT WILL BE THE SCANDAL OF OUR TIMES!” as he put it in an all-caps tweet on June 22.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd he has sounded urgent calls for “LAW AND ORDER,” as he has tweeted time and again.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe also has warned that the “radical left” seeks to endanger families and wipe out livelihoods in suburbs everywhere, as he claimed in his address last month when he formally accepted the Republican presidential nomination.\\n\\n“No one will be safe in Biden’s America,” Trump declared.\\n\\nInstilling calm, this is not.\\n\\n“His political campaign’s branding strategy is panic. They should put ‘PANIC’ on a red hat,” said Tim Miller, a longtime GOP strategist who advises Republican Voters Against Trump.\\n\\nMiller said Trump’s assertion that he played down the threat of the novel coronavirus because he did not want to panic the public was “an absurd defense.”\\n\\n“The person warning about the end of suburbia and migrant caravans looting and raping your daughters, the idea that he’s somebody who wants to turn down the temperature and breathe calm is absurd,” Miller said.\\n\\nRuth Ben-Ghiat, a historian at New York University and author of a forthcoming book, “Strongmen,” described Trump as “a chaos agent” and said his strategy of using fear to encourage dependence on him as a leader fits a global pattern.\\n\\n“All leaders of authoritarian tendencies use methods of psychological warfare on their people by creating environments full of uncertainty,” Ben-Ghiat said. “You never know what to expect from the leader, you never know when he’ll be angry or whom he’ll victimize. They use bureaucratic chaos and create uncertainty to keep people divided, too frightened from mobilizing.”\\n\\nAt Thursday’s news conference, Trump argued that he waited many weeks to share what he knew about the virus being airborne and deadlier, far more lethal than the flu, because he did not want to create panic in the public.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I want to show a level of confidence and I want to show strength as a leader and I want to show that our country is going to be fine, one way or the other,” Trump said.\\n\\nAsked why he did not level with the American people by calmly presenting information about the virus in real time — as, for instance, German Chancellor Angela Merkel had done — Trump was defensive. He said coronavirus outbreaks across Europe were “much worse than the numbers here,” which is false. He also argued that the United States has “rounded the final turn,” an assessment in conflict with much of the data.\\n\\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany bolstered Trump’s defense by telling reporters Wednesday, “This president does what leaders do — good leaders: It’s stay calm and resolute at a time when you face an unsurmountable challenge.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut reporting at the time revealed Trump’s motivations for wanting to avoid panic in January and February to be far more nuanced. The president was fixated during that time not on leadership virtues but on the stock market, which he has long seen as a barometer of his reelection chances. He was strongly averse to any government announcement that might scare investors into a sell-off, his advisers explained.\\n\\nTrump’s critics said the president has been misguided, stoking fear where little exists while trying to instill calm when his silence has had deadly consequences, with the coronavirus death toll now nearing 200,000.\\n\\n“When we talk about what our real threat is, it’s clearly not the child that’s locked up in a detention center. It’s not the mother displaced in asylum or the people trying to cross the border. Our clearest danger right now is the president of the United States,” said Maria Teresa Kumar, president of Voto Latino, a grass-roots political group.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Thursday at the White House, Trump lashed out at a pair of reporters who questioned why he hadn’t been truthful with the public about the lethality of the virus. He effectively said that any suggestion that he should have was nonsense.'}, {'url': 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump--white-men-boat-parade/2020/09/27/dcd7bdd8-fe79-11ea-8d05-9beaaa91c71f_story.html', 'Full Text': 'There were motorcycles and pickup trucks on the shore, and an antique military plane in the sky. Trump flags seemed to far outnumber American ones; at least one Confederate flag flew among them. The dozen or so men firing the cannons wore red hats embroidered with Trump’s name and praise for the president. They shouted strings of excited obscenities as they marveled at the hundreds of boats behind them.\\n\\n“There are still people coming to get into the parade!” exclaimed Shaun Bickley, 54, the barge owner who organized the parade and would later change into a black tank top with “Trump 2020” and an expletive written around an American flag-patterned skull. “Man, do you see all of these people?”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Act like we’re being fired on!” yelled Jeff Karr, 59, who dropped out of high school to join the Ohio National Guard and spent 36 years in the military, including the Army Reserve, with two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. Another volley of explosions sounded.\\n\\nBlue-collar men such as Bickley, Karr and their buddies on the barge are the core of Trump’s base of support, and their enthusiasm for the president has only deepened since they first voted for him, even as Trump has driven away some voters, especially college graduates and women. As illustrated by the masculinity-oozing boat parade, the Trump Party is largely a party of men — especially White men without college degrees and especially those over the age of 40.\\n\\nA majority of White men have long sided with Republican presidential nominees, and they voted for Trump at about the same rates as in previous years, according to exit polls — but Trump won the votes of White men without college degrees by the highest rate in at least 36 years, or as long as comparable exit polling has existed. Four years into a tumultuous presidency, these men consistently give the president his highest approval ratings, and polls show they’re happier with the economy and the direction of the country than White women or voters of color.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTheir connection with Trump is cultural and emotional as much as political, closely intertwined with their lives and identities. His enemies are their enemies, his grievances are their grievances. They live by the rules he lives by: that concepts such as White male privilege or structural racism and sexism are to be scoffed at, that the working class, Christians and Trump supporters have been victimized, that it’s okay to be moved to tears by a love for the country and its president but that liberals are crybabies and snowflakes. They pride themselves on being self-made and see Trump, whose life has been nothing like their own, as a once-in-a-lifetime leader.\\n\\nBickley, who owns two marinas and a shoreline construction company, gets frustrated by the suggestion that White men such as him were born more powerful, or with advantages.\\n\\n“There’s 8 billion of us on the planet. There’s only 780 million White people. . . . So I’m personally really tired of hearing that I’m a majority, that I’m a superpower White privilege kid,” Bickley said. “My mom and dad had nothing. . . . I have been working my whole life.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Now, here I am, 54, and I’ve got a lot of stuff. . . . Somebody says: ‘Look at all of this stuff you have, you must have been privileged.’ Oh, really? Really? I’ve been working since I was 10.”\\n\\nBickley says that while he’s now “on the top of the food chain,” he remembers the years he spent as a lowly worker, helping make other people millions of dollars. He thinks Trump has that same mentality. Trump’s strategy for winning reelection relies on finding more White men who support him but didn’t vote in 2016, as well as pulling in more votes from Black and Latino men.\\n\\n“The people who love Trump can’t be swayed by anything,” Bickley said. “If you love Trump, you’re all in. There’s nobody on the fence. You’re in.”\\n\\nThose on the barge on the Saturday before Labor Day are labeled as “White working-class men” by journalists, political strategists and university researchers — people in professions that some of these Ohio men don’t consider real work, as they define it: the sort that’s physical and might get your hands dirty. That’s the work most of them have been doing since they were children and will continue to do until they die.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMany have done well for themselves without a college diploma, and they’re living a version of the American Dream that involves owning a boat and a truck to haul it.\\n\\nBickley has deep experience organizing large events on the water. For many summers, he hosted the Sandusky Bay Barge Party, which featured live music and bikini-clad women dancing around stripper poles. Bickley likes to circulate a video compilation of women’s jiggling bodies from these parties, set to an off-color song.\\n\\nHe lost his enthusiasm for it in 2015 when his father — a Navy veteran, former police officer and Democrat — died. He started paying attention to the Republican presidential primary and gleefully watched as Trump trounced established politicians — especially former Florida governor Jeb Bush.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“So in typical Bickley fashion, I started liking Trump a lot,” he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor much of his life, Bickley was an independent, although he mostly voted for Republicans, even during the decade that he worked at a quarry and was involved with a union. He’s staunchly conservative on nearly all issues except for those related to the environment, on which he’s aligned with liberals, worried about factory pollution and the health of the nation’s waterways. This is one area where he says he hasn’t studied Trump’s record.\\n\\nBickley loves that Trump puts “America first,” especially when that offends the educated elites. He supports building a wall along the southern border and forcing immigrants who arrive legally to learn English. And he agrees with Trump “constantly backing our men and women in blue,” although he says he has had a few run-ins with law enforcement himself.\\n\\nSomeone on Facebook recently suggested that Trump hasn’t accomplished much and Bickley responded, in part: “46 days away to your absolute pain. Perhaps you could stick a red hot fork in your eye. Or better yet, cut off your little buddy in despair.”\\n\\nEven as Bickley’s businesses have prospered, he still considers himself blue-collar. He recently added an image of Trump’s profile to the window of the back seat of his white SUV, so that it looks as if he is chauffeuring the president around town.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Sometimes my wife will be like: ‘More attention? You just need more attention, Shaun?’ ” he said of his wife of 31 years.\\n\\nThere was something about Trump that transcended both political parties — which is also a big reason Karr voted for him after voting for Barack Obama in 2008 and Ron Paul in 2012.\\n\\nKarr retired from the Army a few years ago, disgusted with most politicians, military leaders, government contractors and federal workers, who he said put their pursuit of wealth and power above all else, including keeping their word. For years, he has struggled with serious digestive issues that he believes were caused by burn pits in the Middle East, and he was frustrated by Veterans Affairs doctors who seemed unable to accurately diagnose him or ease his pain.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSometimes, he said, he feels as if the United States has become a nation of victims, even when they’re not — a feeling that has become especially strong amid protests over racial inequality.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“These guys that say: ‘We didn’t get a chance,’ ” he said. “No, you didn’t take a chance.”\\n\\nKarr says that racism should not be tolerated, but that he doesn’t think the nation’s problems are as bad as the media claims. Slavery was terrible, Karr said, “but that was then and this is now, and we can’t go in a negative direction.”\\n\\nTrump and Biden have squabbled over who could best serve blue-collar workers, but Bickley and Karr rolled their eyes at the notion that Biden understands them. As they see it, Biden has spent his entire career in elective office with a generous salary, posh benefits and opportunities to become wealthy. Trump is right to call him weak, they said. Although Trump was born into a wealthy family, they see him as someone who knows how to build a business and understands the pressure of trying to make payroll.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBickley said he feels bad that Biden’s son Beau died of cancer. As a father of three, he can’t imagine the pain of losing a child. But he’s taken aback that Biden has used that pain “as a political crutch.” He assumes campaign staffers suggested doing so.\\n\\n“He should have punched them in the mouth and said: ‘No, we’re not going there. That’s painful,’ ” Bickley said.\\n\\nAmy F. Grubbe, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party for Erie County, where Sandusky is located, says her volunteers don’t even bother trying to win over the men who voted for Trump in 2016.\\n\\n“People tend to go down with the ship. . . . That hardcore group, they’re going to be flying Trump flags at their funerals 30 years from now,” said Rep. Tim Ryan (D), whose eastern Ohio district is heavily blue-collar. While Ryan said he is confident Biden will win Ohio, he has little hope of converting Trump’s strongest supporters. “They’re all in with him, and there’s no way to change their minds.”\\n\\nThe issues Trump has chosen to highlight are, like his cultural positions, attractive to his White male supporters. His focus on law and order, seen by many as a way to scare some suburban women and seniors into voting for him, has also excited and rallied the men who already love him and are willing to follow him anywhere, including into an actual battle.\\n\\n“We’ll grab my AR and head for Washington and join the police force if they think they’re going to riot and destroy Washington — not under my watch. I will die shoulder-to-shoulder with the cops,” said Karr, the veteran who has three grown sons. “There ain’t no way I am going to accept lawlessness in this country.”\\n\\nHe and Bickley say Trump is right to refuse to accept any blame for the coronavirus pandemic and the nation’s resulting economic problems. Yes, people are getting sick, they said, but they do not believe the death toll is really as high as some claim.\\n\\nBickley and Karr blame the pandemic on China and credit Trump for blocking many foreign travelers from China and other countries. Bickley says he spent thousands of dollars stocking up on food and protective gear. When Trump touted the lifesaving potential of hydroxychloroquine, Bickley ordered 90 pills online, along with a bunch of Z-Paks and some zinc pills, also touted by the president. Although federal health officials have strongly warned against using the medications to treat covid-19, especially without the oversight of doctors, Bickley is confident that they work.\\n\\n“I’m not letting anybody on my team die,” he said.\\n\\nKarr nodded and added: “He’s a friend who cares.”\\n\\n“I’m a friend who can get [stuff],” Bickley said with a laugh.\\n\\nIn July, Bickley’s 32-year-old son-in-law became sick and tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Soon his 27-year-old daughter was also sick. Bickley offered them the medication, but they declined, suggesting that it was “quack science.” The two quickly recovered, he said.\\n\\nAt the boat parade, those on the barge wore headphones or earplugs to protect their hearing against the cannon blasts, but they did not wear masks.\\n\\nTwo weeks after the parade, Bickley was invited by the Trump campaign to sit in the bleachers directly behind the president as he spoke at a rally in Swanton, Ohio, just outside of Toledo. He brought along Karr and some others and wore jeans with rhinestones on the pockets and ostrich skin boots. Because they would be in view of television cameras, the campaign asked the group to put on masks. Most of the thousands who gathered outside did not.\\n\\nAs Trump took the stage and marveled at the sprawling crowd before him, Bickley and Karr did the same. Trump assured the crowd that polls showing a tight race in Ohio were “fake,” which is exactly what Bickley and Karr have been telling people. Trump debated aloud if he should nominate a woman to the Supreme Court or a man, as he did with his first two nominations — the sort of joke that Bickley and Karr say the media always takes too seriously.\\n\\n“I don’t want to make the men too angry,” Trump said as the crowd laughed. “It will be a woman. Is that okay? I don’t want to have a problem with men.”\\n\\nTrump gave himself credit for saving millions of lives and tens of millions of jobs amid the pandemic. He promised to continue to build up the military, the power of which he said he’s not afraid to use on American soil. He told the crowd that he is “the only thing standing between you and chaos,” and he warned “suburban men and husbands” that if Biden is elected, “you’re not going to have your dream very much longer.”\\n\\nTrump left the stage to the recorded sounds of the Village People telling men everywhere that “there’s no need to feel down . . . there’s no need to be unhappy.”\\n\\nBickley said afterward that the sound system near their group wasn’t working properly, so they couldn’t always understand what Trump was saying. But they applauded anyway.\\n\\n“We could see what he saw. We could feel what he felt. We could see the laughter and the joy and the excitement,” Bickley said of their front-row seats. “So the couple times I couldn’t hear him, that was okay; I knew I was supposed to clap. I don’t know what I was clapping about, but I clapped.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/17/trump-cant-decide-whom-he-should-tell-people-hate/', 'Full Text': 'It’s almost as though the idea that Joe Biden is responsible for violence that occurs while Donald Trump is president makes about as much sense as the idea that Biden should have implemented a national mask mandate. The public, whose ability to rationally weigh evidence and logic is sometimes limited, seems nonetheless to have grasped that Trump’s claim to be the guarantor of order made little sense.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDuring his convention speech, Trump said “No one will be safe in Biden’s America.” But the fear of chaos and societal dissolution should Biden be elected doesn’t seem to have taken hold. Consider these new poll findings:\\n\\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll found that only 11% of suburban whites said the most important factor driving their vote was a candidate’s perceived interest in being “tough on crime” and civil unrest. That is down from 13% of suburban whites who responded to a similar poll that ran Sept. 9-10, and 15% who said the same thing in a Sept. 3-8 poll. Instead, suburban whites, like all Americans, have been largely driven by concerns about the coronavirus, which has killed more than 195,000 people so far in the United States, more than any other country in the world.\\n\\nSo not only is the fear of crime not at the top of the public’s agenda, recent polls have shown that they’re more likely to say Trump is making things worse, not better.\\n\\nTrump’s campaign will keep trying new attacks against Biden until it finds something that works. But for now, it’s adrift, without focus. And for Trump, focus means an enemy.\\n\\nNot Biden himself, though. Try as he might, Trump can’t seem to make Americans loathe the former vice president. Some may not like Biden, some may disagree with his policy positions, but he just isn’t the object of a burning hatred, even among Trump supporters, the way Hillary Clinton was.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut back in 2016, it was more than just Clinton. From the moment he announced he’d run for president, Trump posited immigrants as the enemy, a violent horde of invaders coming to take your job and kill your family. It was something so many of his target voters could relate to, since they perceived immigrants as the source of societal changes that made them feel uncomfortable and alienated.\\n\\nBut Trump’s attempts to make “anarchists” and antifa a similar hate-object haven’t found the same purchase. Your average suburban voter doesn’t see her town in flames, and she’s probably never met an anarchist or a member of antifa. They don’t feel like a direct threat. She’s seen some protests on TV that turned violent, but they never seemed like a profound societal force that could shape her life and imperil her family.\\n\\nBut you know what does? This pandemic.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat suburban voter knows people who have gotten sick. She may even know some who have died. Covid-19 is a daily presence in her life. Her kids are struggling with online learning, her community is suffering financially, she hasn’t been able to see her friends and relatives in months — and you’re trying to tell her that anarchists are what she should be mad about?\\n\\nNor can Trump focus anger on Washington the way he did four years ago, since he and his cronies are running it. Every once in a while, you hear them mention “the swamp,” but it inevitably falls flat, not only because he is quite obviously more corrupt than any president in modern times and probably in all of U.S. history, but because you can’t run against the establishment when you’re the establishment.\\n\\nAt least not if you want to persuade anyone who isn’t already behind you. Complaints about the “deep state” opposing Trump may thrill Sean Hannity’s audience and the significant portion of Trump’s base made up of QAnon conspiracy theorists, but those people were always going to vote for him. It won’t win him any new supporters — which he needs, given that he trails Biden by a significant margin.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut it’s difficult to imagine Trump sticking with an economic message from here until November. It’s too quiet, too polite, too ordinary. That’s not how Trump rolls. He needs something more visceral, something that gets the adrenaline pumping and dials up the anger of his crowds. He doesn’t know he’s succeeding until he sees them seethe with rage.\\n\\nAs much as Trump loves to claim that he’s been the greatest president in history and turned every American’s life into unmitigated bliss, he knows that, for him, it isn’t the real path to success. He needs hate and fear to get people to vote for him. But he can’t find the right target.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/18/trump-americas-perfection-shall-not-be-questioned-except-by-me/', 'Full Text': 'For Joe Biden this year, it’s about a restoration of calm and national unity. For President Trump, as ever, it’s about telling voters that there’s a competition underway, one that you’re currently losing — and only he can make you into a winner, restore your dignity and self-worth by vanquishing people you hate.\\n\\nOn Thursday, Trump found a new way to tell this story. He held an event attacking “left-wing indoctrination in our schools” and those who would talk too much about racism. Here’s part of the speech he gave, likely written by in-house white nationalist Stephen Miller:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCritical race theory, the 1619 Project, and the crusade against American history is toxic propaganda, ideological poison that, if not removed, will dissolve the civic bonds that tie us together. It will destroy our country. That is why I recently banned trainings in this prejudiced ideology from the federal government and banned it in the strongest manner possible. The only path to national unity is through our shared identity as Americans. That is why it is so urgent that we finally restore patriotic education to our schools. Under our leadership, the National Endowment for the Humanities has awarded a grant to support the development of a pro-American curriculum that celebrates the truth about our nation’s great history.\\n\\nWe’re discussing the legacy and persistence of racism more now than in decades. And Trump understands that all this talk about institutional racism and White privilege makes many White people feel attacked and defensive, as though they’re being personally accused of sins they feel they haven’t committed.\\n\\nSo in response he gives them permission to stop feeling bad. Not only will I protect Confederate statues and banish talk of racism from schools, he claims, I’ll convince everyone that the real thing we need to eradicate isn’t racism itself but talking about racism.\\n\\nCall it the White Innocence Project.\\n\\n“We’re launching a new pro-American lesson plan,” Trump said later that day on a campaign trip. But the truth is that this will have precisely zero practical impact; the president himself has no power to dictate what schools teach, and even the federal government’s powers are limited.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere will be no “pro-American” curriculum distributed to every school district, no Trump-approved teaching materials vetted for their appropriately over-the-top boosterism — even though for most of our history, textbooks painted just the kind of cheery picture of slavery Trump seems to want.\\n\\nOf course, a Republican candidate running on the idea that his love for America is deeper than that of his opponents is nothing new. Mitt Romney’s campaign biography written for 2012 was called “No Apology: The Case for American Greatness,” a reference to the conservative fantasy that President Barack Obama had gone on an “apology tour” belittling America around the world.\\n\\nYet Trump talks about America’s shortcomings all the time, just as conservatives always have. Four years ago, he told us that we were a country full of losers, suckers and fools. “Nothing works in our country,” he said, and his campaign book was called “Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe understood that the people whose votes he needed, particularly White men, felt a loss of status that was only partly economic; it also came from the ever-increasing diversity of American society. He channeled their anger and resentment, promising to deliver them back to their rightful place at the top of the hierarchy.\\n\\nNo idea was more central to that promise than his proposal to build a wall on the southern border and make Mexico pay for it: We’d kick out all the immigrants, then enact a ritual humiliation on someone else that would allow us to stand tall again.\\n\\nThe fact that it would never happen was almost beside the point. Just electing someone who talked that way was nearly an end in itself, the validation that allowed his supporters to feel like winners.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNow, with his new crusade against critical race theory, Trump offers his supporters another restoration, in which once again he will grant them back their dignity.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHaving enacted a positively historic performance of cruelty toward immigrants — what says “America is great again” more than ripping children from their parents’ arms and throwing them in cages? — now he’ll show those ungrateful Black people and their White liberal enablers a thing or two.\\n\\nThis is the message Trump wants those supporters to hear: We’re done talking about slavery and racism. You don’t have to do any soul-searching, you don’t have to question how American institutions operate, and you sure as hell don’t have to feel guilty about anything. You, beleaguered White man, are the best there is, because you are America, not them.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nConservatives often convince themselves that when liberals point to societal problems and conditions that demand remedial action — the large number of Americans in poverty, or our high rates of homicide, or the fact that American police kill so many people — it’s because they hate America.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBy contrast, when conservatives complain about problems and conditions they don’t like — increasing secularism; the fact that automated customer service systems give you an option for Spanish — they’re only being patriotic, because the things they don’t like about America are betrayals of its true spirit.\\n\\nI have no doubt that the new version of this message will resonate with Trump’s most ardent supporters.

Altogether, we examined 1,047 articles about Obama and 423 about Harris.\\n\\nWhat differences we found\\n\\nAlthough Obama and Harris have both primarily described themselves as Black, the media has portrayed their identities in different ways.\\n\\nObama is described solely as Black in almost half (49 percent) of 1,047 articles. One example is a Nov. 30, 2008, story from the Hoosier Times that said “a black man had been elected to the presidency of the United States of America.” Another post-election story, from a newspaper in Marysville, Calif., referred to Obama as a “black man named Barack Hussein Obama.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the other half of the articles, he is described as biracial. He is “the son of a Kenyan father and a white mother from Kansas,” for example.\\n\\nBy contrast, Harris is described solely as Black in only 34 percent of the articles about her. For example, LaTosha Brown, the co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, celebrated the VP pick as “a historic win for Black women, who have long been disenfranchised.”\\n\\nA larger fraction (60 percent) describe her as both a “Black woman” and an “Asian American,” and the rest describe her as a “woman of color.” For example, in a USA Today article, Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress, argued that the selection of Harris “says to Asian Americans that [they] are not just Americans, too, but part of the civic life, with the ability to reach the highest of offices.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn short, the media tends to describe Harris as the combination of her ethnic identities, in tandem with her gender identity. This was less true for Obama.\\n\\nWhy the difference?\\n\\nOne reason has to do with gender. Prior research suggests that racial boundaries are less malleable for men. For example, one study found that biracial men, and specifically those of Black-White descent, were more likely to be perceived as racial minorities than biracial women.\\n\\nMoreover, there is a long legacy of biracial people of Black-White descent being categorized as simply “Black.” In the United States, the “one-drop rule” long classified people with any Black ancestry as Black. This rule and its legacy may not apply as neatly to Harris because of her Asian and Black heritage.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHarris may also be different from Obama because of her history as a prosecutor, which has produced questions about Harris’s potential appeal to Black Americans concerned about racial bias in the criminal justice system. This controversy may also make political analysts and reporters less likely to see her only as “Black.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhy it matters\\n\\nThe importance of how the media covers Harris isn’t so much that it affects how people see her. Recent research shows that it doesn’t.\\n\\nRather, news coverage that emphasizes Harris’s multiracial background may help the Democratic Party broaden the set of groups that the party is perceived to represent. For some activists, this means establishing the Democratic Party as the party of marginalized groups. Harris’s nomination thus signals not only a commitment to Black people, much as Obama’s nomination did, but also a commitment to women, Asian Americans and immigrants.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOf course, the Republican Party will not let these Democratic efforts go unanswered. Black Republican candidates and Black conservatives in the popular media seek to challenge the assumption that Black voters will turn out for Democratic candidates. They may not.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHowever, if Harris’s candidacy tells us anything, it is that the Democratic Party will not give up “the Black vote” — or the vote of other marginalized groups — without a fight.\\n\\nAndrea Pena-Vasquez (@andrea_penav) is a PhD candidate at the University of Notre Dame.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/02/how-do-newspapers-cover-racial-religious-minorities-heres-data/', 'Full Text': 'Joshua Tucker: First, tell me a bit about how you do your research.\\n\\nErik Bleich: We collect every article from four newspapers with a national circulation — the New York Times, USA Today, the Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post — that mention African Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, Latinos, Jews or Muslims. We then look at two essential things: How positive or negative are those sets of articles, and what are the main topics of coverage? This gives us a good sense of what newspapers convey about each of these groups across the year.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJT: What do you mean by “positive or negative?” How do you measure that?\\n\\nEB: We compare all the words in each article to eight widely used dictionaries of positive and negative words. Our score for each article is benchmarked against the average score of over 40,000 articles from 17 U.S. newspapers from across a 20-year period. So when we say an article is extremely negative, we mean it has a lot more negative words than positive words in it, relative to the average newspaper article.\\n\\nStories that are very negative are not always negative about the group or person. For example, there were a lot of very negative Latino articles that covered the El Paso Walmart shooting in August 2019, which drives down the tone of Latino articles for the entire year. Negative articles can at times evoke sympathy, but even in those, they often leave a lasting residue of negative feelings associated with a group or person in the back of readers’ minds.\\n\\nJT: Given the debate’s explosive discussion of white supremacist groups and everything that has happened this year with the Black Lives Matter movement, what can you tell us about coverage of African Americans in 2019?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEB: African American stories were relatively visible in U.S. newspapers last year and, overall, were relatively close to neutral in tone. Of course, there were a lot of race-related articles about policing. In fact, almost a quarter of all the Black-associated stories mentioned words linked with police or policing. These articles were strongly negative. Some of this coverage included an uptick in stories about New York City’s earlier “stop-and-frisk” policy when former mayor Mike Bloomberg entered the Democratic primary for the presidential nomination. Other coverage of African Americans, however, focused on more positive stories, such as the Democratic presidential bids of senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, or museums, opera and art in the African American community.\\n\\nJT: What is the most striking thing you found for 2019?\\n\\nEB: Coverage of Muslims stands out as having been far more common and far more negative than that of the other groups that we monitored. There were nearly 9,000 articles that mentioned Muslims in 2019. The next most covered group was African Americans, with closer to 6,000 articles. The tone of Muslim articles was also strongly negative — almost four times as negative as the tone of those touching on Latinos, the group associated with the second-greatest negativity.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJT: What is the focus of the negative articles that mention Muslims? Are these mostly about foreign events and locations?\\n\\nEB: Yes, that is a lot of what we see. Stories about Syria and ISIS, the Iran nuclear deal, or terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka and New Zealand [where a white supremacist shot and killed 51 Muslims at two mosques] include quite a high level of negative language. But even articles focused on events in the United States are still more than twice as negative as articles about any other group. Around 4 percent of all articles that mention Muslims also mention Rep. Ilhan Omar, for example, and these stories are just as negative as the average Muslim article. Some articles are about her as a target of President Trump’s insults; others are about accusations of anti-Semitism.\\n\\nJT: What are some other big takeaways from your study?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEB: In addition to analyzing articles that mention a group once or twice, we also zoom in on stories with three or more mentions of a group, and which are more likely to be “about” those groups. In most cases, the tone is relatively similar no matter how many times a group is named. One case is a notable exception. Stories about Jews go from being essentially neutral to clearly negative when Jews are mentioned three or more times. These articles tend to contain more references to topics like anti-Semitism and the Holocaust; a majority of them touch on Israel/Palestine. These topics are more intensely associated with Jews as a group by these newspapers, and they drive greater negativity.\\n\\nJT: Is coverage of these racial, ethnic, and religious groups mostly bad? Do you find any good news?\\n\\nEB: No, and yes, to some degree. On the whole, coverage is not markedly negative. For African Americans, Asian Americans and Native Americans, the average article tone is roughly the same as that in the average U.S. newspaper story. Native Americans and Asian Americans are the least-covered groups in 2019, but coverage is very slightly positive in stories that mention them three or more times. While Native American articles included significant coverage of Elizabeth Warren’s DNA controversy, fully 30 percent mentioned “museums.” Among Asian American articles, a large proportion touched on the theme of educational successes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/21/we-may-get-2008-level-turnout-among-young-voters-thats-bad-trump/', 'Full Text': 'Could that help produce the sort of youth turnout in this election that we last saw in 2008, when Barack Obama’s first presidential run inspired young people to pour out to the polls in unprecedented numbers?\\n\\nThe answer to this might be yes, according to a new poll of 18- to 29-year-olds from the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe poll finds that among likely voters in that 18-to-29 demographic, Biden is leading President Trump by 60 percent to 27 percent among likely voters. That’s significantly better than the 49 percent that Hillary Clinton got in this poll in 2016.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut that’s not all. The poll also finds that an astonishing 63 percent of respondents say they will “definitely be voting,” compared to 47 percent in the 2016 version of this poll.\\n\\nThat matches 2008 levels. The 2008 version of this poll found that among a somewhat smaller segment of young voters, approximately the same percentage said they’d definitely be voting.\\n\\nWhile this comparison between the two subsets isn’t perfect, it nonetheless indicates that it’s reasonable to posit that 18- to 29-year-olds might post 2008-level turnout this time, according to Chase Harrison, the acting director of the Institute of Politics poll.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I would assume that we should see actual turnout among 18-to-29 year-olds similar to actual turnout in 2008,” Harrison told me. “Young voters care about this election.” If so, that would be striking.\\n\\nNow here a wrinkle intrudes: In 2008, in the end turnout among young voters was somewhat lower than what they indicated in this poll (since not all voters who say they will vote end up doing so).\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut still, in 2008 the turnout among this youth demographic ended up being 48.4 percent of eligible voters, according to data from University of Florida demographer Michael McDonald.\\n\\nThat dwarfs youth turnout in any election going back at least to the mid-1980s. If that replicates itself, it could give a lift to efforts to defeat Trump.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHere another wrinkle intrudes: The poll also finds that enthusiasm for Biden is lagging a bit, with 44 percent of young Trump voters being very enthusiastic about voting for him while 30 percent of young Biden voters say the same.\\n\\nDespite this, not only is Biden winning by 2-to-1 among these voters; the overall demographic is promising 2008 levels of turnout. How can this be?\\n\\nHarrison suggests that it might be rooted in recent events.\\n\\n“This is a cohort that has been in many ways uniquely affected by covid,” Harrison told me. “Many younger voters have had their entry into the labor market delayed. They’re facing all sorts of challenges.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHarrison pointed out that many young voters might have more of an identification with young immigrants who were brought here illegally as children and thus enjoyed the Obama-era protections for “dreamers” that Trump has tried to destroy. He noted that this cohort is more racially and ethnically diverse than even the 18-to-29 year-olds who rallied behind Obama the first time.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd, of course, for many young voters, the protests that have swept the country might be their first serious experience of political activism and engagement, similar to how the young people who rallied behind Obama were galvanized by opposition to the Iraq War.\\n\\n“Many of the things that people have been concerned about with Donald Trump have been observed more closely by 18- to 29-year-olds,” Harrison said.\\n\\nTrump, of course, has botched the coronavirus crisis with unique awfulness, even as he’s actively sought to incite a backlash against the protests, which has included unleashing federal law enforcement and threatening to send troops into major cities. And so, if youth turnout really does have a chance of attaining 2008 levels, perhaps this will constitute another way Trump has made his own comeuppance more likely.'}, {'url': 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/wildfires-california-dream-compromise/2020/09/12/780e80da-f465-11ea-a852-eb7526c580f4_story.html', 'Full Text': 'San Francisco, and much of California, has never been like this.\\n\\nCalifornia has become a warming, burning, epidemic-challenged and expensive state, with many who live in sophisticated cities, idyllic oceanfront towns and windblown mountain communities thinking hard about the viability of a place they have called home forever. For the first time in a decade, more people left California last year for other states than arrived.\\n\\nMonica Gupta Mehta and her husband, an entrepreneur, have been through tech busts and booms, earthquakes, wildfire seasons and power outages. But it was not until the skies darkened and cast an unsettling orange light on their Palo Alto home earlier this week that they ever considered moving their family of five somewhere else.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“For the first time in 20-something years, the thought crossed our minds: Do we really want to live here?” said Mehta, who is starting an education tech company.\\n\\nIt would be difficult to leave. They love the area’s abundant nature and are tied to Silicon Valley by work and a network of extended family members, who followed them west from Pittsburgh. But Mehta says it is something she would consider if her family is in regular danger.\\n\\n“Yesterday felt so apocalyptic,” Mehta said. “People are really starting to reconsider whether California has enough to offer them.”\\n\\nThis is the latest iteration of the California Dream, a Gold Rush-era slogan meant to capture the hopeful migration of an old nation to a new, rich West. For generations, the tacit agreement for California residents resembled a kind of too-good-to-be-true deal. Live in the lovely if often drought-plagued Sierra, or beneath the beachfront Pacific Coast cliffs, and work in an economy constantly reinventing itself, from Hollywood to the farms of the San Joaquin to Silicon Valley.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut for many of the state’s 40 million residents, the California Dream has become the California Compromise, one increasingly challenging to justify, with a rapidly changing climate, a thumb-on-the-scales economy, high taxes and a pandemic that has led to more cases of the novel coronavirus than any other state.\\n\\nDuring the course of his term, President Trump has singled out California, a state he lost by 30 percentage points, as an example of Democrat-caused urban unrest, irresponsible immigration policy and poor forest management, even though nearly 60 percent of the state’s forests are managed by the federal government. Several are burning today, with millions of acres already scorched.\\n\\nGov. Gavin Newsom (D) has responded specifically in some cases, but in others, he has invoked the California Dream, an aspirational noun attached to no other state. In his January 2019 inaugural address, Newsom warned that “there is nothing inevitable about” that dream.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“And now more than ever, it is up to us to defend it,” he said.\\n\\nAs the state’s climate has shifted to one of extremes, soaking wet seasons followed suddenly by sharp, dry heat and wind, no region has been safe from fire. This year — even before peak fire season has gotten underway — widespread fires have forced evacuations, from San Jose in Silicon Valley to the distant hamlet of Big Creek along the western slopes of the Sierra.\\n\\nMore than two dozen major fires are burning around the state and have consumed a record 3.1 million acres of land, more than 3,000 homes and at least 22 lives. Los Angeles has reported the worst air quality in three decades as a result of fires surrounding that city, already notorious for orange air and seasonal dry cough.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWine Country has burned four straight years, with a number of vineyards lost. Homes have been destroyed far to the south in San Diego County, and more than 200 campers had to be airlifted to safety amid the Creek Fire, still burning hot and fast between Fresno and Mammoth Lakes.\\n\\nThe mountains behind Santa Barbara County, which gave way after being burned bare by the Thomas Fire three years ago, have turned a worrisome gray-brown tinder in recent weeks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThose slopes, prepared by one of the state’s largest fires in history at the time, slid during rain-saturated mudslides in January 2018. Twenty people were killed in the wealthy enclave of Montecito, sweeping some from inside their foothill homes all the way to the sea.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe mandatory evacuation orders issued then included the home recently bought by Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, newcomers to Santa Barbara’s shifting climate.\\n\\n“Hopefully, this is a wake-up call,” said Anne-Marie Bonneau, who two decades ago left her home in Ontario, Canada, for the Bay Area but misses the clean air and less-fractious political environment beyond the northern border. “What is it going to take for this country to do something about the climate crisis? Millions of people are affected by this.”\\n\\nShe sees what is happening in California as just the beginning of what is to come across the continent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“As always, California’s sort of on the leading edge,” she said. “We’re always ahead of everybody.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKim Cobb is among the climate scientists who, for years, have warned that the consequences of a warming planet will grow more intense, more deadly and more costly over time. But even she has been startled by the scenes unfolding across the West as wildfires rage this summer.\\n\\n“It’s an entirely different thing to look at this footage and hear the sobbing voices of people who have lost loved ones and property and livelihoods,” said Cobb, a professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Earth and Atmospheric Science. “It’s shocking for us emotionally, as well as for any global citizen who is watching this.”\\n\\nShe is also adamant that on our current trajectory, the worst lies ahead.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“The science couldn’t be any clearer on this point. The links between warming temperatures and these wildfires are clear,” Cobb said. “This is going to get a lot worse. . . . I know that challenges the imagination.”\\n\\nThe fire fallout and the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed 14,000 people in California, have provided a kind of CT-scan view of the state and its many inequities.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLatinos account for 61 percent of coronavirus cases, an infection rate disproportionately high given that they make up just 35 percent of the overall state population. Many are the “essential workers” serving food, picking crops and living lives that are not privileged enough to take refuge in the safety of telecommuting.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDuring the summer, the novel coronavirus and wildfires have revealed much for Californians: who stays safe from fire and disease, who keeps their jobs, who waits at home for a shrinking benefits check, and who has a soft-landing evacuation site or a hard shelter bed.\\n\\nThis is the debit side of the California Compromise. It is an economy, the world’s fifth largest, that is built by government policy and private enterprise to favor the skilled in Silicon Valley and Hollywood and the wealthy everywhere else. The rest of California is increasingly a service economy that pays a far larger share of its income in taxes and on housing and food.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMedian income in the state is $75,277. The median home price in San Francisco is $1.3 million, nearly twice that of Los Angeles. The state government is doing next to nothing to close the gap.\\n\\nThree years ago, state lawmakers approved the nation’s second-highest gasoline tax, adding more than 47 cents to the price of a gallon. With home prices skyrocketing along the coast, service workers in particular are moving farther inland from their jobs and into fire country, meaning they are paying far more as a share of their income on fuel just to stay employed.\\n\\nThe taxes raise more than $5 billion in annual revenue for roads and transportation projects. But the sometimes hours-long commutes, with affordable housing so far from job centers, also undermine the state’s goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2045, an achievement that could alleviate some of the extreme weather.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA poll conducted late last year by the University of California at Berkeley found that more than half of California voters had given “serious” or “some” consideration to leaving the state because of the high cost of housing, heavy taxation or political culture.\\n\\nThe draw for some, and the magnet that keeps many here, is the state’s breathtaking physical beauty, family history and a liberal political culture appealing to supporters, many of whom in the north are inheritors of a counterculture ethos.\\n\\nThrough legislation or direct action at the ballot box, California voters established the country’s first “sanctuary state” for undocumented immigrants, built from the ground a vibrant justice-reform movement, and committed to some of the boldest environmental protection goals in the country.\\n\\nIn addition, a measure to restore affirmative action to college admission decisions, banned since 1996, is on the November ballot. The legislature just created a committee to study the cost of reparations to racial and ethnic groups the state has historically mistreated. Marijuana is legal. So are hallucinogenic mushrooms in Oakland.\\n\\nThe political gulf once ran between north and south in California, a Bay Area vs. Los Angeles standoff for power and resources. Now the delineation is east and west, including between liberal San Francisco and towns such as Oroville, now threatened by fire.\\n\\nSarah and Joey Wilson, a therapist and the owner of a gold mining supply shop, respectively, live 15 minutes from Oroville in Kelly Ridge and are experienced evacuees. But what most bothers them, beyond the frequent fires, is encroachment by the government on their outdoor lifestyles.\\n\\nLakes that Joey used to fish are now off-limits. State-erected gates now block public roads he used to drive to access recreational land. And regulations have limited some kinds of gold prospecting, the hobby that supports his business.\\n\\n“That’s actually probably made us want to move more than something like this,” Sarah Wilson, 45, said of the close-by wildfire flames.\\n\\nThe loyalty to liberal politics serves as an anchor for many of the state’s urban — and most-entrenched — residents. But it has only light, if any, appeal to newcomers or those here specifically for work.\\n\\nPeter Alvaro has lived in his rent-controlled apartment in the heart of San Francisco since 1999, when he moved from New Jersey for a taste of the city’s famed counterculture.\\n\\nHe knows the fires will only get worse, as they have steadily in the past three years. But Alvaro feels his identity is tied up in the city and in the surrounding nature. He loves raising his two daughters here, going to the beach three times a week and watching the city constantly change around him.\\n\\nMany of the people leaving San Francisco are tech workers, newly freed from the city they helped make so expensive by the ability to work remotely during the coronavirus outbreak.\\n\\n“The tech workers weren’t necessarily attached to the city, they came here because there was opportunity,” said Alvaro, a professor of computer science at the University of California at Santa Cruz. “I hope the city can regrow some of the unique character that was lost in the last boom. The fact that young, wealthy adults are fleeing is good for the culture.”\\n\\nJust after the first fires started last month, Gary Cook and his wife packed their three rescue cats into a rented SUV and drove from Napa to their new home in Idaho. After 18 years in Wine Country, Cook and his wife felt California was not right for them anymore.\\n\\nIt was not the fires, which Cook said were not an issue for him, but the area’s cost of living, high taxes, power outages and political climate. Cook, who recently retired, felt that as a conservative, he no longer had a voice politically in California.\\n\\n“There were significant changes going on that changed our outlook on the whole California dream,” Cook said.\\n\\nHe said he will miss Napa’s famed restaurant scene. Idaho is laid back, and the people are more aligned with his views, but it is more of a steak-and-potatoes kind of place, he says.\\n\\nBusiness is booming for Scott Fuller, who runs a real estate relocation business. Called Leaving the Bay Area and Leaving SoCal, the company helps people ready to move away from the state’s two largest metro areas sell their homes and find others.\\n\\nNevada, Arizona, Texas and Idaho are the top four states his clients are buying in, and many tech workers are trying out smaller industry hubs such as Denver, Austin, Phoenix and Seattle.\\n\\nSince the pandemic began, he also has been helping people move to less-populated areas within the state such as Placerville or Lake Tahoe. But that trend could reverse quickly because of the record wildfire season, which has been burning around those regions.\\n\\n“For a lot of people, [California’s] losing its luster,” Fuller said. “For the average person who maybe came out here for the weather, I think they’re saying the trade-off is just not worth it any longer.”\\n\\nIt has been hard to locate a place on the map, outside the city centers, where a fire has not cropped up in the past month. Some are burning deep in wilderness, a possible long-term benefit for the health of the forests now struggling for the same scant water supply, and others along coastal stretches that have never seen fire in modern history.\\n\\nOthers are haunting the dry foothills where fire — and death — have been commonplace in recent years.\\n\\nJust a few miles north of Oroville lies the Sierra foothill town of Paradise, having burned to the ground in just hours on Nov. 8, 2018, in a wind-whipped tragedy of historically deadly proportions.\\n\\nEighty-five people died, many simply overwhelmed by the sprinting flames as they tried to flee in cars and on foot. The Bear Fire is at Paradise’s door again, with much less there to burn as the city slowly rebuilds.\\n\\nNow a thick layer of black and white ash covers the streets, sidewalks and shops of Oroville, a city of 15,000 people that swelled by 25 percent virtually overnight with evacuees from the fire in Paradise, also known as the Camp Fire. The fire followed a near-disaster by a year when the Oroville Dam spillways almost failed with the flooding of the Feather River, threatening to inundate the city.\\n\\nIt is difficult today to find an Oroville resident who did not know someone who perished or lost a home in the Camp Fire. Now, amid a pandemic, the fast-moving Bear Fire is forcing new evacuations as it burns northeast of town.\\n\\nThe fire already has wiped out the small town of Berry Creek, which sits just north of Lake Oroville. Just outside of Oroville, police cars block entry to the roads that lead to the lake, which this time of year would normally be abuzz with Jet Skis and motorboats.\\n\\nBut few residents of Oroville, a conservative, roll-with-the-punches kind of frontier place, are discouraged enough to leave California.\\n\\nMore than natural disasters, many residents say it is the liberal overreach of the Democrat-dominated government of their state that has them frustrated. In 2016, Trump won Butte County in a state where he was trounced almost everywhere else.\\n\\n“California is always going to be California,” said Judy McClure, 69, a retired school librarian.\\n\\nRather than leave, she said, she would like to see the government loosen regulations and allow more aggressive forest management to prevent bigger fires.\\n\\n“There’s too much government,” she said.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/14/why-hispanic-vote-florida-is-particularly-worrisome-bidens-campaign/', 'Full Text': 'Alvarez immigrated to the United States from Cuba.

But Alvarez wasn’t there to convince blue-collar workers in Michigan. He was there, it’s safe to say, to bolster Trump’s position with Cuban Americans in Florida.\\n\\nNationally, Biden maintains a big advantage among Hispanic voters relative to 2016 exit polling. A Washington Post average of recent polls shows that he’s faring almost as well as Hillary Clinton did with that group four years ago. In Arizona, he’s outperforming Clinton — a good sign for his candidacy. But in Florida, the picture is starker for the Democrat: His lead over Trump is only in the low double-digits.\\n\\nWhy? Several recent polls have offered a hint: the density of the more-heavily Republican Cuban vote.\\n\\nThe differences between Cuban American and other Hispanic voters was obvious in 2016 exit polls. About 3 in 8 Hispanic voters in the state were Cuban that year, and they preferred Trump by 13 points. Non-Cuban Hispanics preferred Clinton by 45 points, more in line with the national figure.\\n\\nSeveral recent polls have reflected similar differences: Cuban American voters more strongly support Trump than do Hispanic voters overall. Hence the problem for Biden. About three-quarters of Cuban immigrants to the United States live in the electoral-vote heavy swing state of Florida.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe same phenomenon is visible at a county level nationally.\\n\\nThere’s a loose correlation between the density of the Hispanic population in a county and how the county voted in 2016. Two heavily Hispanic counties stand out here, Los Angeles and Miami-Dade. The former was more heavily supportive of Clinton despite being less heavily Hispanic.\\n\\nMiami-Dade also has a large Cuban American population — the largest in the country.\\n\\nComparing the density of the Cuban population among a county’s Hispanic population, the results-vs.-density chart reverses. Setting aside places with small Hispanic populations (such as Wheeler County, Neb.), a few counties stand out. A number are in Florida.\\n\\nOne of the interesting trends in Cuban American politics has been the difference in partisan identity between older and younger Cuban Americans. When then-President Barack Obama began an effort to normalize relations with Cuba in 2014, we noted data from Pew Research Center showing that while Cuban Americans overall had become more Democratic, it was younger Cuban Americans (fewer of whom are immigrants) who were more likely to be Democrats.\\n\\nThose data haven’t been updated since 2013, but the pattern isn’t unexpected. Vietnamese immigrants in California, for example, are often more heavily Republican, in part because Republican politicians in the United States like Ronald Reagan held a more hard-line position against communist and socialist states.\\n\\nThat’s the sentiment that Alvarez was meant to bolster.

Others noted that most undocumented immigrants, whom Trump has repeatedly bashed as a detriment to the economy, often pay more than he did.\\n\\n“He contributed less to funding our communities than waitresses & undocumented immigrants,” wrote Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who noted that she, too, had paid more in 2016 and 2017 while working as a bartender. “Donald Trump has never cared for our country more than he cares for himself. A walking scam.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJoseph Bankman, a Stanford Law School professor who studies tax law, told The Washington Post that a comparable tax payment would most commonly be found among Americans who make between $15,000 and $20,000 a year.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“We’re talking about someone who works at a McDonald’s, and not someone who is managing it,” he said. “This is an hourly worker at a fast-food restaurant.”\\n\\nIf the tax return is filed by a married couple, like Trump and his wife, Melania, Bankman said, a comparable income in the broader population moves up, but only slightly. Another couple in the United States paying that much in federal taxes would most likely be making between $20,000 and $25,000 together.\\n\\nIn other words, Bankman said, it might be analogous to two minimum-wage workers who are married to each other.\\n\\nIn 2016, about half a million tax returns were filed by couples who make that much, Bankman said.

For the first time in a decade, more people left California last year for other states than arrived.\\n\\nMonica Gupta Mehta and her husband, an entrepreneur, have been through tech busts and booms, earthquakes, wildfire seasons and power outages. But it was not until the skies darkened and cast an unsettling orange light on their Palo Alto home earlier this week that they ever considered moving their family of five somewhere else.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“For the first time in 20-something years, the thought crossed our minds: Do we really want to live here?” said Mehta, who is starting an education tech company.\\n\\nIt would be difficult to leave. They love the area’s abundant nature and are tied to Silicon Valley by work and a network of extended family members, who followed them west from Pittsburgh. But Mehta says it is something she would consider if her family is in regular danger.\\n\\n“Yesterday felt so apocalyptic,” Mehta said. “People are really starting to reconsider whether California has enough to offer them.”\\n\\nThis is the latest iteration of the California Dream, a Gold Rush-era slogan meant to capture the hopeful migration of an old nation to a new, rich West. For generations, the tacit agreement for California residents resembled a kind of too-good-to-be-true deal. Live in the lovely if often drought-plagued Sierra, or beneath the beachfront Pacific Coast cliffs, and work in an economy constantly reinventing itself, from Hollywood to the farms of the San Joaquin to Silicon Valley.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut for many of the state’s 40 million residents, the California Dream has become the California Compromise, one increasingly challenging to justify, with a rapidly changing climate, a thumb-on-the-scales economy, high taxes and a pandemic that has led to more cases of the novel coronavirus than any other state.\\n\\nDuring the course of his term, President Trump has singled out California, a state he lost by 30 percentage points, as an example of Democrat-caused urban unrest, irresponsible immigration policy and poor forest management, even though nearly 60 percent of the state’s forests are managed by the federal government. Several are burning today, with millions of acres already scorched.\\n\\nGov. Gavin Newsom (D) has responded specifically in some cases, but in others, he has invoked the California Dream, an aspirational noun attached to no other state. In his January 2019 inaugural address, Newsom warned that “there is nothing inevitable about” that dream.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“And now more than ever, it is up to us to defend it,” he said.\\n\\nAs the state’s climate has shifted to one of extremes, soaking wet seasons followed suddenly by sharp, dry heat and wind, no region has been safe from fire. This year — even before peak fire season has gotten underway — widespread fires have forced evacuations, from San Jose in Silicon Valley to the distant hamlet of Big Creek along the western slopes of the Sierra.\\n\\nMore than two dozen major fires are burning around the state and have consumed a record 3.1 million acres of land, more than 3,000 homes and at least 22 lives. Los Angeles has reported the worst air quality in three decades as a result of fires surrounding that city, already notorious for orange air and seasonal dry cough.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWine Country has burned four straight years, with a number of vineyards lost. Homes have been destroyed far to the south in San Diego County, and more than 200 campers had to be airlifted to safety amid the Creek Fire, still burning hot and fast between Fresno and Mammoth Lakes.\\n\\nThe mountains behind Santa Barbara County, which gave way after being burned bare by the Thomas Fire three years ago, have turned a worrisome gray-brown tinder in recent weeks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThose slopes, prepared by one of the state’s largest fires in history at the time, slid during rain-saturated mudslides in January 2018. Twenty people were killed in the wealthy enclave of Montecito, sweeping some from inside their foothill homes all the way to the sea.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe mandatory evacuation orders issued then included the home recently bought by Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, newcomers to Santa Barbara’s shifting climate.\\n\\n“Hopefully, this is a wake-up call,” said Anne-Marie Bonneau, who two decades ago left her home in Ontario, Canada, for the Bay Area but misses the clean air and less-fractious political environment beyond the northern border. “What is it going to take for this country to do something about the climate crisis? Millions of people are affected by this.”\\n\\nShe sees what is happening in California as just the beginning of what is to come across the continent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“As always, California’s sort of on the leading edge,” she said. “We’re always ahead of everybody.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKim Cobb is among the climate scientists who, for years, have warned that the consequences of a warming planet will grow more intense, more deadly and more costly over time. But even she has been startled by the scenes unfolding across the West as wildfires rage this summer.\\n\\n“It’s an entirely different thing to look at this footage and hear the sobbing voices of people who have lost loved ones and property and livelihoods,” said Cobb, a professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Earth and Atmospheric Science. “It’s shocking for us emotionally, as well as for any global citizen who is watching this.”\\n\\nShe is also adamant that on our current trajectory, the worst lies ahead.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“The science couldn’t be any clearer on this point. The links between warming temperatures and these wildfires are clear,” Cobb said. “This is going to get a lot worse. . . . I know that challenges the imagination.”\\n\\nThe fire fallout and the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed 14,000 people in California, have provided a kind of CT-scan view of the state and its many inequities.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLatinos account for 61 percent of coronavirus cases, an infection rate disproportionately high given that they make up just 35 percent of the overall state population. Many are the “essential workers” serving food, picking crops and living lives that are not privileged enough to take refuge in the safety of telecommuting.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDuring the summer, the novel coronavirus and wildfires have revealed much for Californians: who stays safe from fire and disease, who keeps their jobs, who waits at home for a shrinking benefits check, and who has a soft-landing evacuation site or a hard shelter bed.\\n\\nThis is the debit side of the California Compromise. It is an economy, the world’s fifth largest, that is built by government policy and private enterprise to favor the skilled in Silicon Valley and Hollywood and the wealthy everywhere else. The rest of California is increasingly a service economy that pays a far larger share of its income in taxes and on housing and food.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMedian income in the state is $75,277. The median home price in San Francisco is $1.3 million, nearly twice that of Los Angeles. The state government is doing next to nothing to close the gap.\\n\\nThree years ago, state lawmakers approved the nation’s second-highest gasoline tax, adding more than 47 cents to the price of a gallon. With home prices skyrocketing along the coast, service workers in particular are moving farther inland from their jobs and into fire country, meaning they are paying far more as a share of their income on fuel just to stay employed.\\n\\nThe taxes raise more than $5 billion in annual revenue for roads and transportation projects. But the sometimes hours-long commutes, with affordable housing so far from job centers, also undermine the state’s goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2045, an achievement that could alleviate some of the extreme weather.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA poll conducted late last year by the University of California at Berkeley found that more than half of California voters had given “serious” or “some” consideration to leaving the state because of the high cost of housing, heavy taxation or political culture.\\n\\nThe draw for some, and the magnet that keeps many here, is the state’s breathtaking physical beauty, family history and a liberal political culture appealing to supporters, many of whom in the north are inheritors of a counterculture ethos.\\n\\nThrough legislation or direct action at the ballot box, California voters established the country’s first “sanctuary state” for undocumented immigrants, built from the ground a vibrant justice-reform movement, and committed to some of the boldest environmental protection goals in the country.\\n\\nIn addition, a measure to restore affirmative action to college admission decisions, banned since 1996, is on the November ballot. The legislature just created a committee to study the cost of reparations to racial and ethnic groups the state has historically mistreated. Marijuana is legal. So are hallucinogenic mushrooms in Oakland.\\n\\nThe political gulf once ran between north and south in California, a Bay Area vs. Los Angeles standoff for power and resources. Now the delineation is east and west, including between liberal San Francisco and towns such as Oroville, now threatened by fire.\\n\\nSarah and Joey Wilson, a therapist and the owner of a gold mining supply shop, respectively, live 15 minutes from Oroville in Kelly Ridge and are experienced evacuees. But what most bothers them, beyond the frequent fires, is encroachment by the government on their outdoor lifestyles.\\n\\nLakes that Joey used to fish are now off-limits. State-erected gates now block public roads he used to drive to access recreational land. And regulations have limited some kinds of gold prospecting, the hobby that supports his business.\\n\\n“That’s actually probably made us want to move more than something like this,” Sarah Wilson, 45, said of the close-by wildfire flames.\\n\\nThe loyalty to liberal politics serves as an anchor for many of the state’s urban — and most-entrenched — residents. But it has only light, if any, appeal to newcomers or those here specifically for work.\\n\\nPeter Alvaro has lived in his rent-controlled apartment in the heart of San Francisco since 1999, when he moved from New Jersey for a taste of the city’s famed counterculture.\\n\\nHe knows the fires will only get worse, as they have steadily in the past three years. But Alvaro feels his identity is tied up in the city and in the surrounding nature. He loves raising his two daughters here, going to the beach three times a week and watching the city constantly change around him.\\n\\nMany of the people leaving San Francisco are tech workers, newly freed from the city they helped make so expensive by the ability to work remotely during the coronavirus outbreak.\\n\\n“The tech workers weren’t necessarily attached to the city, they came here because there was opportunity,” said Alvaro, a professor of computer science at the University of California at Santa Cruz. “I hope the city can regrow some of the unique character that was lost in the last boom. The fact that young, wealthy adults are fleeing is good for the culture.”\\n\\nJust after the first fires started last month, Gary Cook and his wife packed their three rescue cats into a rented SUV and drove from Napa to their new home in Idaho. After 18 years in Wine Country, Cook and his wife felt California was not right for them anymore.\\n\\nIt was not the fires, which Cook said were not an issue for him, but the area’s cost of living, high taxes, power outages and political climate. Cook, who recently retired, felt that as a conservative, he no longer had a voice politically in California.\\n\\n“There were significant changes going on that changed our outlook on the whole California dream,” Cook said.\\n\\nHe said he will miss Napa’s famed restaurant scene. Idaho is laid back, and the people are more aligned with his views, but it is more of a steak-and-potatoes kind of place, he says.\\n\\nBusiness is booming for Scott Fuller, who runs a real estate relocation business. Called Leaving the Bay Area and Leaving SoCal, the company helps people ready to move away from the state’s two largest metro areas sell their homes and find others.\\n\\nNevada, Arizona, Texas and Idaho are the top four states his clients are buying in, and many tech workers are trying out smaller industry hubs such as Denver, Austin, Phoenix and Seattle.\\n\\nSince the pandemic began, he also has been helping people move to less-populated areas within the state such as Placerville or Lake Tahoe. But that trend could reverse quickly because of the record wildfire season, which has been burning around those regions.\\n\\n“For a lot of people, [California’s] losing its luster,” Fuller said. “For the average person who maybe came out here for the weather, I think they’re saying the trade-off is just not worth it any longer.”\\n\\nIt has been hard to locate a place on the map, outside the city centers, where a fire has not cropped up in the past month. Some are burning deep in wilderness, a possible long-term benefit for the health of the forests now struggling for the same scant water supply, and others along coastal stretches that have never seen fire in modern history.\\n\\nOthers are haunting the dry foothills where fire — and death — have been commonplace in recent years.\\n\\nJust a few miles north of Oroville lies the Sierra foothill town of Paradise, having burned to the ground in just hours on Nov. 8, 2018, in a wind-whipped tragedy of historically deadly proportions.\\n\\nEighty-five people died, many simply overwhelmed by the sprinting flames as they tried to flee in cars and on foot. The Bear Fire is at Paradise’s door again, with much less there to burn as the city slowly rebuilds.\\n\\nNow a thick layer of black and white ash covers the streets, sidewalks and shops of Oroville, a city of 15,000 people that swelled by 25 percent virtually overnight with evacuees from the fire in Paradise, also known as the Camp Fire. The fire followed a near-disaster by a year when the Oroville Dam spillways almost failed with the flooding of the Feather River, threatening to inundate the city.\\n\\nIt is difficult today to find an Oroville resident who did not know someone who perished or lost a home in the Camp Fire. Now, amid a pandemic, the fast-moving Bear Fire is forcing new evacuations as it burns northeast of town.\\n\\nThe fire already has wiped out the small town of Berry Creek, which sits just north of Lake Oroville. Just outside of Oroville, police cars block entry to the roads that lead to the lake, which this time of year would normally be abuzz with Jet Skis and motorboats.\\n\\nBut few residents of Oroville, a conservative, roll-with-the-punches kind of frontier place, are discouraged enough to leave California.\\n\\nMore than natural disasters, many residents say it is the liberal overreach of the Democrat-dominated government of their state that has them frustrated. In 2016, Trump won Butte County in a state where he was trounced almost everywhere else.\\n\\n“California is always going to be California,” said Judy McClure, 69, a retired school librarian.\\n\\nRather than leave, she said, she would like to see the government loosen regulations and allow more aggressive forest management to prevent bigger fires.\\n\\n“There’s too much government,” she said.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/30/former-dhs-insider-sheds-darker-light-trumps-vile-proud-boys-comment/', 'Full Text': 'Pressed at the debate to condemn “white supremacist and militia groups,” Trump said he would. Then, after Joe Biden pushed him to condemn the far-right extremist “Proud Boys,” Trump told them to “stand back and stand by,” then immediately pivoted to attacking the left — without condemning either the Proud Boys or white supremacist groups.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA day later, Trump is now claiming that he has no idea who the Proud Boys are, and is calling on them to “stand down” and “let law enforcement do their work.”\\n\\nBut there is zero doubt that the Proud Boys, who celebrated Trump’s initial comments with great joy, as well as other similar groups, will continue taking an undiluted message of empowerment from what happened.\\n\\nThis is where Neumann’s Twitter thread comes in.\\n\\nAs Neumann recounted, she had a front-row view of the surge of right-wing extremist activity in the Trump era, since it took place on her watch. She said that in her position, she tried to get Trump to take this sort of right-wing extremism far more seriously, yet was unable to do so.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNeumann noted that she, along with others, “tried to educate” Trump and his staff on this threat. Strikingly, Neumann also said that she viewed Trump as bearing some of the blame for the mass murder in El Paso, where the alleged shooter told police he was targeting “Mexicans.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNeumann pointed out that an online manifesto believed to be linked to the alleged shooter had used language about immigrants that Trump often uses, calling them an “invasion.”\\n\\n“I concluded after the attacks in El Paso that POTUS was complicit in the deaths of Americans for his refusal to recognize his language was in the shooter’s manifesto,” tweeted Neumann, who has said she voted for Trump but has since spoken out publicly against him.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNeumann asked us to look at Trump’s latest comments in this context. “He was given the opportunity to condemn White Supremacy,” she said. “He refused.”\\n\\nWhat this strongly suggests is that Trump surely knows that all sorts of right-wing extremists and white supremacists out there are paying extremely close attention to his language, both about their potential targets and about the groups themselves.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis includes language from Trump that comes in response to their activity. Other experts on right-wing extremist groups have noted that when Trump declines to offer unequivocal condemnation of them — such as with his “many sides” comments after white supremacist violence and murder in Virginia — they understand this as tacit support.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump offered exactly the same sort of language at the debate. After saying he’d condemn white supremacy, he immediately said: “Almost everything I see is from the left wing, not from the right wing.”\\n\\nThis language is itself a clear sign to those groups that Trump is willing to deflect attention from them, giving them cover.\\n\\nAs Neumann also pointed out, Trump can still issue an unequivocal condemnation of this activity any time he wants. If not, she noted, we should assume he “intended” to refrain from such full condemnation — again, in the full knowledge that these groups are heavily influenced by what he says.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump’s latest clean-up comments stop well short of that. Indeed, Neumann just said that they are “not a condemnation,” and added: “Extremists will assume he was sending them a signal last night.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHere’s the final point: It seems likely that Trump and his staff have been extensively briefed on all these nuances — that these groups pay extremely close attention to what he says about their activity, and that hedging or equivocating in response to it only emboldens them further. Yet this continues unabated.\\n\\nWe need to know more about what Trump and his staff have been told about the impact of his own words on these groups. It would shed more light on just how depraved and reckless Trump is being through his refusal — or inability — to condemn them forcefully and unequivocally.

Republicans might cling to their Senate majority even as millions more Americans vote to be represented by Democrats.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe are already in an age of minority rule. If Republicans manage to hang on to their power, it will get much worse.\\n\\nSome of the most profound abuses of democracy in recent years have happened at the state level; what’s happening there now offers us hints of what is to come. Let’s look at Florida, a perfect example of how Republicans use the full range of their powers to make sure democracy doesn’t threaten their hold on government.\\n\\nLike many states, Florida used to have a law that deprived people convicted of felonies of their voting rights. These laws are a racist relic of the post-Civil War era, a tool designed to help maintain white supremacy (even if they sweep up plenty of White people in the disenfranchisement).\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn 2018, a ballot initiative amending the state constitution to eliminate this law got nearly 65 percent of the vote. But the GOP-controlled state legislature soon passed a law stating that ex-felons could only vote if they paid every last penny of every fine and fee they had been assessed. And the system for paying those fines and fees is so convoluted that even people trying to pay them find it almost impossible.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome of those voters sued, but earlier this month, a conservative majority on a federal appeals court denied their plea to not be victimized by what is essentially a poll tax.\\n\\nSo everything was going according to plan: Despite what voters demanded, the GOP kept the disenfranchisement system in place. But then Mike Bloomberg, who has some extra money lying around, vowed to help former felons pay off their fines. Now the state’s attorney general — yes, a Republican — announced that she is investigating Bloomberg for possible violations of election law.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat this shows is a broad Republican mobilization — the state’s legislature, its governor, its attorney general and the courts — all teaming up to beat back an expansion of democratic rights the public overwhelmingly supported.\\n\\nFor the Republican Party, that kind of effort is a matter of survival — and in the coming years, it will become more important to them than ever.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nConsider the political landscape of 2021 if Trump wins. It would almost certainly be because he once again assembled an electoral college victory that overcame the popular vote — and, in all likelihood, because the Supreme Court stepped in to shut down vote counting, disallow legitimate ballots, possibly rubber-stamp efforts by Republican state legislatures to reject their voters’ choice or otherwise save him from the will of the electorate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere will be gigantic protests across the country amid public outrage at its will being denied and the reelection of a corrupt, incompetent bigot. At Trump’s urging, those protests will be met with thuggery from his armed supporters and violent crackdowns by police.\\n\\nSeeing the chaos engulfing the country, Republicans will look ahead to 2022 and foresee a Democratic sweep that decimates their power at every level of government.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn a different universe, they might consider altering their rhetoric and policies to appeal to a diversifying America. But with Trump leading them, it will not be possible. The only choice will be to double down.\\n\\nWhich would mean mobilizing all three branches of the federal government to fortify minority rule, a wide-spectrum attack on democracy to maintain Republican power in a country that with each passing day is less likely to support it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt will require creativity and commitment, to make the attack on democracy not just defensive but offensive. They could pass an Anti-Voting Rights Act to make voter suppression easier across the country. The Justice Department, which under William P. Barr has already become Trump’s personal law firm, will devote itself to investigating elected Democrats — including potential 2024 presidential candidates.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Supreme Court will join the effort, striking down nonpartisan redistricting commissions, gutting campaign finance laws to increase the influence of plutocrats over our elections and perhaps even validating Trump’s move to exclude undocumented immigrants from census counts used to determine congressional representation. State suppression laws such as the notorious one in North Carolina that an appeals court said targeted African Americans “with almost surgical precision” could get the thumbs-up.\\n\\nDoes this sound far-fetched? By now, the question is absurd. Ask yourself this: Is there any action you can think of, perhaps outside of literally dropping nuclear bombs on cities where Democrats live, about which you could say “Republicans would never go that far”?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf they win this year, more than ever before, democracy will be their enemy.

They laugh at the suckers who believed them in 2016 when they said a Supreme Court pick had to wait for a new president. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) chortles about the legislative graveyard that stymies hugely popular legislation. They can do these things because a government designed to prevent the tyranny of the majority has become vulnerable to the tyranny of the minority.\\n\\nTwo Republican presidents in the past quarter century entered the White House with a minority of the popular vote. Together, those presidents appointed four of the justices on the Supreme Court. The Senate bias in favor of small states with small populations has been exaggerated as the bigger states get even bigger and more diverse. Despite the growth in nonwhite voters in larger metropolitan areas in blue states, the influence of White voters grows even more pronounced. CNN’s Ron Brownstein explains, “Today the 47 Democratic senators represent almost 169 million people, while the 53 Republican senators represent about 158 million. ... The senators in the current Democratic minority won 14 million more votes than those in the Republican majority.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt some point, our system (if it does not already) will lack democratic legitimacy. Consider the very real possibility of yet another election that skirts the popular vote, decided by a Supreme Court dominated by justices who themselves were nominated by men who became president without a majority vote and confirmed by a Senate majority that has drifted further from a representative cross-section of voters. As Brownstein notes, Trump and the Republican Senate majority were put in place by “states with few immigrants, more White Christians and relatively fewer college graduates. Fully 26 of the 30 states Trump won rank among the 30 states with the smallest share of immigrants, according to census data; those same states elected 45 of the 53 Republican senators.\" That does not sound like “democracy” to many Americans; it surely does not sound like multiracial democracy.\\n\\nThe question is not whether the system is designed that way; it is whether it is tenable in the 21st century to have a Senate dominated by overwhelmingly small White states, a Supreme Court that is entirely untethered to popular will and a president without a popular majority. Likewise, our voting system is far from the envy of the world. It is a system in which voters face barrier after barrier, in which voter suppression techniques have been legitimized by the undemocratic Supreme Court and in which one party can intentionally sabotage the credibility of an election.\\n\\nThe good news is that if you think the system has strayed too far in the direction of minority rights, changing it might be easier than you think. We do not have to live with the system as is. The system has changed before, as it did when the 17th Amendment allowed for direct election of U.S. senators and when the franchise was expanded by the 15th, 19th and 26th Amendments. We have divided states (as when West Virginia severed from Virginia) and added others.\\n\\nPlainly, only one party has an interest in making the system more democratic. A Democratic president and a Democratic-led Congress could revive the preclearance procedures of the Voting Rights Act and move under the 14th Amendment to ban discriminatory practices such as voter-ID requirements, gerrymandering and voting-roll purges. Making Election Day a holiday, instituting automatic voter registration and ensuring voting-by-mail is accessible and secure in every state can expand the franchise, a critical component of any democracy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Senate can alter or abolish the filibuster to prevent obstruction from a minority. Congress can alter the size of the Supreme Court and the lifetime tenure of justices. It can admit D.C. and Puerto Rico as states, another step toward democratization. It can expand the House of Representatives (something that has not happen since 1911).\\n\\nState legislatures and governors can mute the electoral college. States can require that their electoral votes be awarded to the national popular-vote winner. Under such rules, presidents would no longer campaign in just a few battleground states (and perhaps Trump would pay more attention to natural disasters in Western states that he has already written off). Winning 270 votes in the electoral college would finally reflect the popular vote.\\n\\nThese ideas are generally opposed by Republicans precisely because they are small-\"d\" democratic. For decades, Republicans have clung to power by a shrinking White minority. They cannot and do not want to appeal to a greater cross-section of Americans, so they do whatever is needed to disenfranchise groups perceived as unwinnable, or to at least tamp down on their influence. That’s not a system that protects minority rights.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome of these reforms might have serious drawbacks. Others might not be necessary if, for example, the electorate more closely tracks the demography of the country. There might be more effective means of expanding democracy. But these ideas should all be on the table. A bipartisan commission of constitutional experts from a wide ideological spectrum should study issues, quantify the extent of our slide toward minority domination and provide a menu of options. The country deserves a national debate on the state of our democracy.\\n\\nAt issue in 2020 is how democratic we want our nation to be. If you think a system that grows less attached to popular will with each passing year can endure and function without losing legitimacy and without regard to racial justice, then you will oppose any change. But let’s be clear: We can choose to limit the tyranny of the minority.\\n\\nRead more:\\n\\nAD'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/08/kamala-harriss-critics-fell-into-is-she-likable-trap/', 'Full Text': \"Wednesday’s vice-presidential debate, the first one ever to feature a Black woman, was a textbook example of this gender disparity in politics. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) was going up against a White man, Vice President Pence, who because of his race and gender doesn’t have to consider whether he’s likable to get votes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThus, Pence could and did interrupt Harris’s allotted speaking time (not to the degree of President Trump in his debate last week, but enough to get noticed) without worrying it would ding how people felt about his campaign.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHARRIS: That is -- PENCE: Senator -- HARRIS: That is -- PENCE: -- that's the math. HARRIS: -- absolutely not true. That tax bill -- PENCE: Is he only cutting -- is he only going to repeal part of the Trump tax cuts? HARRIS: If you don’t mind letting me finish. ...\\n\\nBut research shows voters hold women to a much higher standard of likability and experience. And that Black women are doubly saddled with a perception that they are naturally angry or domineering in nature. So Harris had a lot of hills to climb just by being on that stage and who she is, the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants.\\n\\nAnd that’s why her facial expressions — not her words — were the subject of intense criticism on the right. To the inevitable conclusion of: She wasn’t likable enough.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“She was terrible,” President Trump said in a Fox Business interview the next morning. “I don’t think you can get worse and totally unlikeable.”\\n\\nHere’s Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), a top Republican.\\n\\nAnd South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem (R) on Fox News: “Her persona was off. She was smug and condescending. And I just don’t think that resonates with people today.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOr journalist Megyn Kelly:\\n\\nHarris’s actions appeared carefully calculated to the reality that she would be judged this way. She would smile (rather than give any other facial expression or interrupt and risk coming off as angry) when Pence would say something false and it wasn’t her turn to speak.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen Pence did try to interrupt her early on, she told him, “I’m speaking,” but without raising her voice.\\n\\nHarris is naturally a direct talker, and she criticized the Trump administration plenty on Wednesday. But she also didn’t bring the energy of a forceful, forward-marching attack we saw during the primaries, when she went after Democrat Joe Biden’s record on busing. And that may have been on purpose.\\n\\n“If she appears too tough, then she could jeopardize her likability, and that’s a nonnegotiable for women” when voters are deciding whom to vote for, warned Amanda Hunter of the Barbara Lee Family Foundation in an interview in August when Biden picked Harris as his running mate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd yet:\\n\\n“She was just not prepared for it,” Donald Trump Jr. said on Fox News after the debate. “You could see it in the facial expressions, in the attitude that she took, and the fact that she had to start resorting to all sorts of lies and going back to the usual lies that they've been pushing for decades.”\\n\\n“No, I don’t think she did a good job of making herself likable. And the scowls and the funny faces were not that helpful,” said Karl Rove on Fox News.\\n\\n“How those smirks and nods and eye rolls and laughs play on the split-screen is another part of the debate,” Fox News Host Brett Baier threw out there for viewers to chew on.\\n\\n“The only real mistake Kamala D. Harris made tonight was the over-smirking, over-smiling,” Fox News analyst Geraldo Rivera said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLiberal group Media Matters compiled a whole host of blue-checkmark Twitter accounts on the right criticizing her facial expressions, or using language saturated in sexism or racism to describe Harris’s performance.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis kind of language was largely relegated to the conservative Fox News world. But given how polarized the country is, that’s a significant chunk of it. And opposition to people like Harris because of who she is a defining feature of the Trump movement.\\n\\nAs The Fix’s Eugene Scott wrote before the debate, in anticipation of such reaction: “Harris, a biracial woman born to parents from Jamaica and India who immigrated to the United States, is arguably a manifestation of the trends [that many Trump supporters] disapprove of.”\"}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/09/nobody-likes-her-trump-tries-his-likability-standard-women-politicians-kamala-harris/', 'Full Text': '“People don’t like her. Nobody likes her. She could never be the first woman president. She could never be. That would be an insult to our country,” Trump said Tuesday at a campaign rally in Winston-Salem, N.C.\\n\\nThe president didn’t say why it would be insulting for Harris to occupy the Oval Office — a position she is not actually running for, although Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said it was key that his VP pick be ready for the top job on “Day One.” But in the president’s attacks on Harris last month, he used several unflattering adjectives to describe the woman hoping to become vice president.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“She was nasty to a level that was just a horrible thing, the way she was, the way she treated now-Justice Kavanaugh. And I won’t forget that soon,\" he told reporters. “I thought she was the meanest, the most horrible, most disrespectful of anybody in the U.S. Senate.\"\\n\\n“Nobody likes her.” \\'Nasty.” “The meanest.” “Most disrespectful.”\\n\\nTrump regularly attacks his male critics, giving them nicknames that he hopes shapes their image for his supporters and other voters. But focusing on the likability of the women who threaten his position seems to be a particular focus of Trump’s. And it is a sentiment that women in the workplace often hear when attempting to climb the career ladder.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe used his “nasty woman” phrase when competing against his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, someone he regularly portrayed as unlikable even though she went on to receive more votes than Trump. And now he is using that line of attack against Harris, who has a higher favorability rating than Trump, according to the most recent Washington Post poll.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt is likely that Trump will spends quite a bit of time on Harris’s likability because he believes it will be effective. Amplifying how unlikable Clinton supposedly was worked in Trump’s favor in 2016, and the president is probably hoping the same will be true this year.\\n\\nMy colleague Amber Phillips previously wrote about research from the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, a nonpartisan group that advocates for women in politics, showing that female candidates must be likable to earn a person’s vote. The organization published a 2017 report on likability and electability for women that said:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLikability and qualifications are the two components of electability that women must consistently balance. Past research conducted by BLFF has repeatedly shown that women face a litmus test that men do not have to pass. Voters will support a male candidate they do not like but who they think is qualified. Men don’t need to be liked to be elected. Voters are less likely to vote for a woman candidate they do not like. Women have to prove they are qualified. For men, their qualification is assumed. Women face the double bind of needing to show competence and likeability.\\n\\nWhich is perhaps why Trump is also attacking Harris in the area of competence. While speaking last month to supporters in New Hampshire, Trump said:\\n\\n“You know, I want to see the first woman president also, but I don’t want to see a woman president get into that position the way she’d do it — and she’s not competent. She’s not competent. They’re all saying, ‘We want Ivanka.’ I don’t blame you.\"\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt’s no surprise that Trump believes his own daughter — who has worked alongside him in business and the White House — would be a more competent president than Harris, a former prosecutor who broke glass ceilings on her way to holding statewide offices before entering Congress — achievements that neither Ivanka nor even the president have accomplished. Which raises the question: Why doesn’t Trump like Harris — someone whom he previously supported in her political career?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt could be as simple as he sees her as a threat to his political legacy. Harris has been quite vocal in her desire to devote her time to undoing as much of the Trump presidency as possible if elected.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/10/bidens-campaign-goes-full-throttle-trump-lied-people-died/', 'Full Text': 'During the call, I asked the campaign and Urquiza to respond to Trump’s defense that he was simply trying to prevent panic. Campaign adviser Bill Russo said that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden time and again had promised to “level with the American people.” Biden, he said, believes Americans \"can handle the truth”; Trump does not. I was surprised Russo did not burst out laughing at the notion that Trump is interested in preventing public panic, given Trump’s wild stories of mysterious figures on planes headed for the Republican National Convention, his warnings that Biden will destroy suburbs, his claims that Biden will destroy the economy and his tendency to paint Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists. One can almost hear Biden in the debates say, “C’mon, man.”\\n\\nIn a more personal vein, Urquiza said: “My dad trusted this president. He listened to the president and followed his advice. So sure, my dad did not panic. Instead, he died.” She added, \"I’d much rather have put up with a father who was a little scared versus one that was led to his death.”\\n\\nIs there any sign Republicans are ready to break with the president? Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), also on the conference call, confessed, “I can’t explain this spinelessness.” History, he said dryly, will not treat them well. Speaking for many Americans, Brown explained: “I am flummoxed. ... It must bother their consciences.” As the lawyers would say, the last part assumes facts not in evidence.\\n\\nOver the past 24 hours, we have gotten clarity on certain aspects of the Biden campaign. First, the speed and extent of its attacks on Trump for his comments on the military and his confession to misleading the public on covid-19 suggest the Biden team thinks these are fatal errors for the incumbent president who has wrapped himself in pro-military mystique and insisted he has nothing to apologize for in handling the pandemic. Expect those hundreds of millions of dollars the Biden camp raised in August to be used, in part, to make sure every voter knows what Trump said. It is easy when it has Trump on tape.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSecond, the most devastating aspect of Trump’s dishonesty: the deaths he could have prevented by telling everyone from the get-go that this is a deadly airborne disease and that we must wear masks, avoid crowds and practice social distancing. Family members, friends and colleagues of those who died while Trump lied can be powerful witnesses to Trump’s mendacity.\\n\\nThird, the Biden camp has figured out Trump has no defense. Not only were Trump’s comments recorded, but we also have multiple public statements including his remarks on Wednesday that confirm he intentionally played down the virus. The more Trump lashes about, raising dumb excuses (Why didn’t Bob Woodward out me sooner?), the deeper Trump digs.

Minorities including immigrants have streamed to the suburbia. Bloomberg reported last year that “today’s suburbs no longer look much like the lily-white places portrayed on 1950s and 1960s sitcoms. Whites comprised less than ten percent of growth of the suburban population in America’s 100 largest metros between the years 2000 and 2010.” In short, when Trump says Biden “threatens” to destroy the suburbs by bringing in “low-income housing\" — meaning making them less White — he is decades late. Some individual neighborhoods in suburbia certainly are not well integrated, but non-Whites compromise a greater share of the suburbs than Trump’s politics frozen in the 1950s recognizes.\\n\\nIt might not be surprising then that a recent Monmouth poll shows, “Overall, about 3 in 4 Americans believe that having more racially integrated neighborhoods in their local communities is either very (41%) or somewhat (33%) important.” The percentage who say it is very important is up five points from January. A blatantly racist pitch is not likely to win these voters over, in part because the suburbs include many non-Whites. Bloomberg reported last year, “Between 1970 and 2000, the share of African Americans living in suburban Atlanta increased from 27 percent to 78 percent; while in greater Washington D.C it rose from 25 percent in 1970 to 82 percent.”\\n\\nThe suburbs have been trending away from Republicans since Trump was elected. In 2016, Trump won the suburban vote 49 percent to 45 percent. By 2018, Democrats split the suburbs with Republicans 49 to 49 percent. Now, The Post reports the suburban vote is a major weak point for Trump: “Biden holds an 11-point lead among suburban voters in Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Nevada, where the president appeared for a not-socially distanced rally last night, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll released Saturday.” This is in line with The Post’s national polling: “A mid-August Washington Post/ABC News poll showed Biden winning the suburbs by 8 points. Suburban women support Biden by 13 points compared to a more even divide among men there.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn key battleground states, Biden is also winning strongly among suburban voters. In a recent NBC/Marist Poll, 59 percent of suburban voters in Pennsylvania disapprove of Trump’s performance with only 38 percent approving; when asked about their voting preference, suburban Pennsylvanians pick Biden by a nearly identical margin (58 to 39 percent). In polling in Wisconsin — the location of recent violence in Kenosha — Biden leads 48 to 43 percent.\\n\\nPart of the explanation for Trump’s failure to win over suburbia is his choice of topic. The moderate group Third Way has been studying suburbia in a polling project that started in January. Co-founder and executive vice president Matt Bennett tells me, “The first question is what suburban voters, who will decide the election, worry about more: the economy and COVID or protests and violence. Our data indicate strongly that it’s the former.”\\n\\nThat is one reason Biden is strenuously focusing on covid-19 and tying Trump’s failure to address it to the recession. Unless something changes dramatically, Biden stands to win the suburbs — making a Trump victory nearly impossible. There simply are not enough rural White voters to carry Trump to victory, if Democrats maintain their lock on urban voters and hang onto gains in the suburbs.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWatch Opinions videos:'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/20/when-it-comes-race-relations-left-right-are-miles-apart/', 'Full Text': 'The low prioritization of race relations among GOP voters helps put into perspective why President Trump and the Republican Party have chosen to respond to the issue in the way they have.\\n\\nEven if that’s not surprising, it matters.

Since the earliest days of his presidential campaign, he has communicated a vision of the country that views America at its best when rooted in the past.

Critical Race Theory is being forced into our children’s schools, it’s being imposed into workplace trainings, and it’s being deployed to rip apart friends, neighbors, and families.\\n\\nTrump’s critics have focused on this from the moment he began running, when his campaign announcement speech stoked white supremacist ideals by portraying immigrants from Mexico as a threat to the American way of life in part because of their Latino heritage.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMost Americans — especially those left of center — have concluded Trump is racist, according to a Yahoo News-YouGov survey.

Once a mutation occurs, it will remain in the genome of the virus and all its future offspring — a clue that can reveal how the virus has spread. ← Virus C T G T T T A C A A G G T T C G C G A C T G C T C G T A C G T G G C T T T G G A G A C T C C G T G G A G G A G G T C T T A T C A G A G G C A C G T C A A C A T ←\\n\\n← Nucleotides\\n\\n← ← Mutation C T G T T T A C A A G G T T C G C G A C T G C T C G T A C G T G G C T T T G G A G A C T C C G T G G A G G A G G T C T T A T C A G A G G C A C G T C A A C A T → C T G T T T A C A A G G T T C G C G A C T G C T C G T A C G T G G C T T T G G A G A C T C C G T G G A G G A G G T C T T A T C A G A G G C A C G T C A A C A T →\\n\\nThese single-letter switches rarely change the way the virus behaves. But much the way shared features help a person recognize members of the same family, researchers use the mutations to group samples into virus “sub-strains.” Their findings can help decipher which infections are related to one another, exposing links invisible to traditional contact tracers.\\n\\nKenny wasn’t sure what he would find in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. But it would be information — objective evidence in a pandemic rife with obfuscation and uncertainty. He figured he had to try.\\n\\nHe converted his suddenly empty lab into a coronavirus sequencing facility. He ordered the chemicals and kits needed to study viral genomes, sought approval from Gundersen’s institutional review board to sequence samples taken from patients at the system’s hospital and clinics.\\n\\nThe first vials of virus arrived in early April, carried by courier in a cooler packed with ice. Sequencing them was a multistep operation that took the better part of 48 hours, but the data was more useful the faster it came in. To keep the process going, Kenny would drive to his darkened laboratory at odd hours of the night, carefully pipetting samples onto sequencing chips while the world around him slept.\\n\\nWhen he at last had results in hand, Kenny uploaded each genome to a global database, then sorted the sequences into their spots on the coronavirus family tree. This allowed him to identify distinct sub-strains introduced to the region from outbreaks around the world.\\n\\nTwo sub-strains, found in La Crosse and Postville, shared a distinctive mutation, marking them as part of the same major lineage.\\n\\nPostville, Iowa The two sub-strains share this mutation . La Crosse, Wis.\\n\\nBy the time the viruses arrived in the Midwest, they had acquired additional key mutations that Kenny could use to track each sub-strain.\\n\\nPostville: 3 key mutations Each sub-strain also has unique key mutations that identify it . La Crosse: 4 key mutations\\n\\nEach virus variant acts as a spark; if it lands on poor kindling — say, someone who practices social distancing and is able to quarantine as soon as she realizes she is sick — it will soon die out. Most of the sub-strains Kenny sequenced, including the La Crosse variant, showed up only a few times in his data, suggesting these sparks were quickly extinguished.\\n\\nLa Crosse, Wis.

This is a crazy, out-of-control situation,’ ” Kenny said. “The fact that they all . . . clustered together on this tree really indicated there was a single introduction to that region that really took hold and expanded.”\\n\\nThe scientist began to scour the documents that accompanied his virus samples. Though the tiny vials of virus had no names attached to them, they came with fairly detailed medical records. The patients ranged in age from 7 to 80. Their symptoms spanned from mild coughs and headaches to breathlessness and raging fever.\\n\\nBut most compelling was this: The majority of initial patients infected with this sub-strain worked at Agri Star or lived with someone who did.\\n\\nSomething had gone terribly wrong in Postville, Kenny realized. Something that provided fuel for a single virus spark to erupt into an inferno.\\n\\n[Get a free briefing on the latest pandemic developments in your inbox with our Coronavirus Updates newsletter]\\n\\nThe outbreak\\n\\nMagdalena Toj Garcia had worked at Agri Star for more than a decade. She went in six days a week to carve up carcasses and clean up spills, arriving before dawn and leaving long after dark. When she learned about the virus in March, she wanted one thing: a mask.\\n\\n“No,” a supervisor told her. “We are only going to give them to the sick.”\\n\\n“But that is precisely why I need a mask,” Toj insisted. “So I will not get sick.”\\n\\nThe answer was still no.\\n\\n“That is a lie,” Agri Star owner Hershey Friedman said when asked about this incident. He said that all workers were required to wear masks in the facility.\\n\\nAgri Star’s head of health, safety and human resources, Diane Guerrero, later clarified that in March the plant was following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that only sick people wear masks. The plant switched to universal mask use when the agency recommended it on April 3.\\n\\nBoth Friedman and Guerrero said the company undertook extensive efforts to protect its 575 workers. The plant plastered public health notices around the facility, doubled the number of hand sanitizer dispensers and installed barriers between workstations. A cadre of workers called “the Covid Crusaders” cleaned surfaces. Starting in early April, they began taking every employee’s temperature and asking them about their health before they entered.\\n\\nIf plant employees became infected, Friedman told The Post, it wasn’t while at work. “There was zero covid-19 in our facility,” he said.\\n\\nToj, and several of her colleagues who were diagnosed with the coronavirus, told a different story.\\n\\nAgri Star confirmed Postville’s first coronavirus cases in mid-March, fracturing the uneasy peace among its diverse residents: the Orthodox Jews who help run the plant, the immigrants from Somalia, Mexico and Central America who make up much of its workforce, the White descendants of the German and Scandinavian farmers who founded the town generations ago.\\n\\nTwelve years earlier, the plant had been the target of one of the largest Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in history. The town rebounded after Friedman, a Canadian business magnate, bought the plant out of bankruptcy in 2009. But the effects of the raid are still felt in the way people mostly keep to their ethnic enclaves. Conversations about the coronavirus are held in hushed tones — when they are held at all.\\n\\n“The problem was here, but people didn’t want to talk about it,” said one ranch worker, whose wife — an Agri Star employee — was hospitalized with covid-19 for more than a week.\\n\\nAgri Star acknowledged three early cases connected to the plant in a brief statement in The Yeshiva World, an Orthodox Jewish online news publication. But Toj and her colleagues, many of whom speak little English, didn’t read the article. Though Guerrero said the company told supervisors to notify anyone who worked near someone who tested positive, six workers who got sick told The Post that no one from the plant warned them about their potential exposure or asked who else they might have infected. Workers said they were forced to triangulate their risk based on snatches of rumor and snippets of fact.\\n\\n“They’re going to get us sick,” Toj would often say, “and they don’t even know it.”\\n\\nThe closest health clinic to Postville had so few covid-19 tests that many residents were sent to Gundersen’s main hospital in La Crosse, where Kenny worked, more than an hour away.\\n\\nAgri Star should conduct its own testing, Toj told her husband, Rudy Pérez. If workers at least knew where the sickness was, they could protect themselves.\\n\\nThe company said it asked the state to test its workers on April 20, more than a month after it confirmed the first infections connected to the plant.\\n\\nBefore then, plant executives told employees to stay home if they had symptoms, Pérez said. That wasn’t much of an option for Agri Star’s low-wage employees, who, like about a quarter of all U.S. workers, have no paid sick leave. The emergency coronavirus legislation passed this March includes a requirement for paid sick leave, but it does not apply to businesses like Agri Star with more than 500 employees — even when workers are instructed to quarantine.\\n\\nToj took matters into her own hands, purchasing six face masks for herself and her husband. The couple would bathe as soon as they got home from work and drank mug after mug of hot tea with lemon, which they hoped would ward off disease.\\n\\nOn a Friday morning in early April, a plant supervisor instructed Toj, Pérez and several others to scrub down the offices, bathrooms and dining area used by the plant’s rabbis, who were not coming into work. It wasn’t until they finished that their supervisor asked if they had used protective equipment, Toj said.\\n\\nOne worker said she had been given a mask that day, but it became so soaked with blood from her work in the slaughterhouse that she had to take it off to breathe. Toj said she had been given no protection at all.\\n\\nThe company’s policy, Guerrero said, is to hand out gear to employees based on their daily assignment. As long as they describe where they’re headed, “everybody is issued the proper equipment,” she said. “Whether they choose to wear it or not is a concern.”\\n\\nIn the days after the cleaning, Toj recalled, “I really started feeling bad, bad, bad.” Though Guerrero said the plant required employees to report symptoms, Toj tried to push through her illness, worried that missing a shift could get her fired. But the virus was settling in her cells, fogging her head and flooding her with fatigue.\\n\\nFinally, Toj felt her chest tighten until she couldn’t breathe. She rushed outside the plant, gasping for air.\\n\\n“I’m scared,” she told her husband. “I am going to the hospital. I need to know if I have it.”\\n\\nThe diagnoses came for both of them two days later: positive.\\n\\nToj called a friend who had cleaned the rabbi’s rooms alongside her. Her friend had also been diagnosed with the virus; her husband was feverish and presumed positive. At least two other members of the cleaning crew tested positive, Toj said, and all the others showed symptoms.\\n\\nBoth women are convinced they contracted the virus at Agri Star. “We didn’t go anywhere else — from our house to work, from our house to work,” said Toj’s friend, who spoke on the condition anonymity out of fear for her job.\\n\\nToj sent her daughters to live with her mother while she and her husband fought off the virus. For three weeks, they were bedridden. And the bills kept piling up: rent, groceries, $300 for Toj’s chest x-ray. She looked over her scant belongings, trying to think of what to sell. She ran through a mental list of friends who might support them and called her boss at Agri Star to ask for financial assistance. Help never came.\\n\\nThe company says it has no record of Toj’s request.\\n\\nHidden numbers\\n\\nSeventeen miles north of Postville, in the county seat of Waukon, city councilman John Ellingson could barely step out of his house in April without being bombarded with anxious questions.\\n\\n“John, what do you know?” constituents would ask, at the grocery store or passing his table at the S&D Café on Main Street. “What’s going on?”\\n\\nLike him, they had been tracking the unusually high case counts for their rural area; the county’s positivity rate was almost as high as Manhattan’s. Yet in a place as spread out as Allamakee, those cases could be next door, or about an hour away. It wasn’t enough to know that the virus was in the county, Ellingson said — people needed to know where.\\n\\nBut when the Republican councilman asked the state health department for a breakdown of infections in each of the county’s 18 townships, the state refused.\\n\\nOfficials claimed that would violate medical privacy law, even though many other states stratify case counts by Zip code. The state wouldn’t even tell Ellingson how many cases were in his own town. When he persisted, the department stopped returning his calls.\\n\\nThe numbers reported at the governor’s news conferences “were damn near worthless,” Ellingson said. “It was more a political show than it was informative to the citizens.”\\n\\nAnd his constituents?\\n\\n“They were pissed,” Ellingson said, “knowing the government had information and they weren’t giving it.”\\n\\nWhen Ellingson asked the Iowa health department for a breakdown of infections in each of Allamakee County’s 18 townships, the state refused.\\n\\nIn seeking what seemed like a simple answer to an obvious question, Ellingson ran into what scientists say is one of the biggest barriers to controlling the pandemic: a dire shortage of facts. There are few national standards for collecting and reporting case counts and hospitalizations. A review of outbreak data led by former CDC director Tom Frieden found that no state discloses even half of what health experts consider “15 essential indicators” for managing the disease.\\n\\nAs the government shifted its coronavirus reporting system, numbers have vanished from CDC Web pages. News organizations have had to sue for information about racial disparities in deaths. In many Florida counties, officials won’t tell parents whether there are coronavirus cases at their children’s schools.\\n\\nIowa is no exception. The state has refused to release its pandemic plan, which guides its response to the coronavirus, saying the document is “confidential.\" The health department’s covid-19 dashboard doesn’t list hospitalizations among health care workers or outbreaks in congregate facilities such as homeless shelters and prisons.\\n\\nIn July, state auditor Rob Sand said Iowa’s system for reporting test results was rife with “illegal and unbusinesslike practices, inefficiencies, and apparently pointless risks.” He criticized Iowa’s use of medical privacy laws to justify its secrecy.\\n\\n“If you live in this town, you’re literally making decisions that affect your health,” Sand said. “And you have people like the state of Iowa and people like meatpacking companies that are falsely describing what the law allows them to do in order to shield the fact that they simply don’t want to share that information.”\\n\\nBy the time Ellingson launched his quest for data, Iowa officials had already received warnings about Agri Star. Weeks earlier, an anonymous worker had called the Iowa Occupational Safety and Health Administration (IOSHA), reporting that employees had been exposed to rabbis who had tested positive for the virus, one of whom was “deathly ill.” A few days later, a lawyer for Iowa Legal Aid told IOSHA that two Agri Star workers said the plant was unsafe. According to the April 3 complaint, released under a public records request from The Post, employees were working closely together and were not given protective equipment.\\n\\n“Several employees are required to come to work ill,” the complaint said. “Management is telling workers that covid-19 is a lie and it has been made up by the government.”\\n\\nIOSHA never visited the plant to investigate these claims; on-site inspections in Iowa have been curtailed during the pandemic. Instead, the agency asked Agri Star for a written response.\\n\\n“Not everyone understands the value of our operations being open, but we can assure you we have taken precautions to ensure our employees are safe,” Guerrero wrote in an April 14 letter.\\n\\nShe denied all the allegations in the complaint and offered a long list of the measures she said the company had adopted: handwashing trainings, homemade masks. The complaint was closed.\\n\\nThose early months of the pandemic were a scramble, Guerrero recalled. She’d never handled a health crisis like this — no one had — and the government provided little help. The Department of Labor and the CDC didn’t release guidance for meatpacking facilities until April 26. The Iowa health department rarely communicated with her about tracking new cases or tracing their contacts, leaving Guerrero to cobble together a spreadsheet of sick workers on her own. When she walked outside the plant, she said, it seemed as though the rest of the town wasn’t taking any precautions at all.\\n\\n“Nobody was really able to guide us on how we should maneuver through this,” she said.\\n\\nIt wasn’t until May 5, more than seven weeks after the first Postville cases were diagnosed and 15 days after Agri Star requested help, that a state testing strike force finally came to the plant. Over 450 workers were tested for current and past infections.\\n\\nIowa did not make the results of that event public, and Guerrero said the state provided no interpretation when it sent the company its lab report.\\n\\nThe state’s policy, articulated by Department of Public Health deputy director Sarah Reisetter at a May 27 news conference, is to only disclose outbreaks in workplaces like meatpacking plants if 10 percent of employees test positive, and then only if specifically asked by a member of the media. (A nursing home is considered to have an outbreak once three people test positive.) The state declined The Post’s requests for Agri Star’s case data.\\n\\n“We didn’t really provide any information about them at all,” Polly Carver-Kimm, a former spokeswoman for the Iowa health department, said of towns like Postville.\\n\\nShe said secrecy was the state’s unwritten rule. The governor’s communications director wouldn’t let her talk to the press without his approval, Carver-Kimm said. She believes she was retaliated against for doing her job: talking with reporters and releasing vital information about covid-19.\\n\\nAfter 13 years on the job, Carver-Kimm resigned in July. This month she filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against Iowa, saying she was pressured to leave after pushing to make more covid-19 data available to the public.\\n\\nPat Garrett, communications director for Reynolds, declined to answer a detailed list of questions about the state’s response. He instead issued a brief statement, saying, “The state of Iowa worked to get testing to all meat processing facilities in Iowa. We regularly reported outbreaks at meat packing facilities if 10 percent of their workforce tested positive.”\\n\\nAfter more than a month of effort, Ellingson finally got a hold of case numbers broken down by Zip code as of May 12: Postville had 87 of Allamakee’s 97 covid-19 infections.\\n\\nWaukon had three.\\n\\nThe councilman posted the numbers on Facebook and told constituents he planned to update them every few days. But then he found out the county workers who had shared the data had been told they could be fined, fired, even imprisoned for violating medical privacy laws.\\n\\nEllingson stopped clamoring for data. The number of cases in Postville has not been released since.\\n\\nCracking the case\\n\\nToj and Pérez spent three weeks battling the coronavirus. Their oldest daughter also apparently came down with the disease: The 14-year-old lost her sense of taste for several days.\\n\\nEven more frightening was when Toj’s mother fell sick. She spent six days in the hospital, breathing oxygen through a tube. She recovered, Toj said, because God was protecting her. This whole time, God was the only one protecting them all.\\n\\nToj walked back into the plant for the first time in late April and encountered a changed Agri Star. All around the building, posters proclaimed the importance of hand washing. New workstations had been marked out on the floor to help people maintain social distance. Every employee was given a homemade mask.\\n\\n“Now we need masks?” Toj asked, infuriated. “Six feet of distance — for what? Everybody is already infected because there were lots of people who got sick and they didn’t even notice.\"\\n\\nBut Kenny did. He kept a vast chart of the region’s coronavirus outbreak pinned to a cork board in his office in La Crosse. Tiny colored dots represented cases for which he had a genome. Thin lines connected them according to the mutations they shared.\\n\\nLooking at the Postville cluster — more than two dozen yellow dots linked by three distinctive mutations — it was clear to him what happened. The sub-strain started with a single case. But in the crowded conditions of the meat processing plant, it exploded.\\n\\n“A single viral introduction led to unrestrained spread within the facility,” Kenny wrote in a study on the website MedRxiv, where scientists post “preprint” research that has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. His research, he said, showed “the collateral damage resulting from widespread dissemination of this disease from a meat-packing epicenter across a large midwestern region.”\\n\\nMultiple lines of evidence put Agri Star at the epicenter of this outbreak, Kenny said. The fact that patients from across Postville’s diverse communities were infected with the same sub-strain — despite living, shopping and worshiping in different places — suggests they contracted the illness in the one setting they shared: the plant.\\n\\nAlso key was that Kenny found a husband and wife with “clearly genetically distinct” variants of the Postville sub-strain. Usually couples infect each other, so they carry identical versions of the virus. But these two had acquired their infections separately — most likely at the plant, where they both worked.\\n\\n“I think one needs to jump through a lot of mental hoops to avoid the conclusion that the plant itself was a significant nexus for spread,” Kenny said.\\n\\nSince Kenny’s results have not undergone peer review, The Post asked seven independent researchers to assess his findings. All agreed that Kenny had found evidence of a cluster of closely related cases, though some cautioned that broader and more representative sampling would strengthen his conclusions.\\n\\nThey also made a key point: While Kenny had clearly found a chain of genetically linked viruses in people who worked at or were connected to Agri Star, an analysis like his cannot definitively show how the virus got into the plant or exactly how individuals became infected. Those details may never be known.\\n\\nYet an explosion of genetically linked cases is exactly what scientists would expect from the conditions that workers described, said Bronwyn MacInnis, a virologist at the Broad Institute in Boston.\\n\\nMacInnis, who has worked on genomic epidemiology investigations during outbreaks of Zika, malaria and now the coronavirus, noted that the vast majority of covid-19 cases are thought to be driven by “super-spreader” situations, where large groups gather in enclosed areas. Kenny’s data, she said, “show that was the case in this setting.”\\n\\nHoping he could help the government response, Kenny took his results to a coalition of local health departments, including Allamakee County officials. In other countries, genomic epidemiology has helped identify chains of transmission so officials could stop the coronavirus from spreading.\\n\\nBut few U.S. health departments have taken full advantage of the cutting-edge tool. As far as Kenny knows, no one from Allamakee County or the state of Iowa ever acted on his genetic evidence.\\n\\nAnd the virus kept on spreading. Kenny identified the Postville sub-strain in patients from 15 cities across three states. A case was detected by researchers in Ecuador this July. According to Kenny, at least one person infected with the sub-strain has died.\\n\\nGenetic information indicates that a variant of the coronavirus that was first found in Postville, Iowa, spread to surrounding counties.

WIS. Detail IOWA Dubuque ILLINOIS IOWA\\n\\nBoth Agri Star and Iowa knew many plant employees became sick, The Washington Post has found. The strike force testing of 463 workers in May found 12 active cases of covid-19 and at least 106 people with antibodies, which are evidence of past infection. Agri Star received lab results for a further 49 positive antibody tests, which Iowa did not report among the county’s case totals.\\n\\n“That’s a lot of people who were positive for antibodies,” said Gigi Gronvall, an immunologist at Johns Hopkins University who is an expert on serology tests. The figures suggest “they had an outbreak and it went on for some time.”\\n\\nIt’s unclear why the state did not report the full number of positive antibody tests. But at least 20 percent and as many as 29 percent of Agri Star workers contracted the coronavirus between mid-March and early May. These numbers, which Guerrero confirmed, clearly exceed the CDC’s recommended definition for an outbreak — two or more linked cases of a disease — and likely meet Iowa’s 10 percent threshold.\\n\\nHealth experts and worker advocates have criticized Iowa’s metric, which was adapted from an older policy for monitoring flu outbreaks in schools.\\n\\nCovid-19 is far more contagious and virulent than the flu, said Jan Flora, a sociology professor at Iowa State University. “To use the same threshold means that the state and the meatpacking plant will always be attempting to close the barn door after the horse has escaped.”\\n\\nIn denying The Post’s request for Agri Star’s case numbers, the Iowa Department of Public Health said it only released information about workplaces in cases of “active viral infection.\" In other words, because the state took so long to test workers, the peak of the outbreak had already passed — so Iowa never had to acknowledge that the outbreak occurred at all.\\n\\nCases in Allamakee County are creeping back up. With 27 new daily cases per 100,000 residents, Iowa has one of the highest infection rates in the country.\\n\\nIt also has some of the nation’s loosest coronavirus restrictions. Reynolds has rebuffed a White House task force recommendation to issue a statewide mask mandate. Bars remain open in all but six counties, and public schools are required to hold at least half of their classes in person. Since the state does not report school outbreaks, an Ames couple have taken it upon themselves to track cases in the state’s education system; as of Sept. 24 they have found 473 infected students and 246 infected staff.\\n\\nMany people in Postville think the danger is over, because no one in power has said otherwise. Masks are rare on the small town’s streets. Toj and Pérez have returned to their storefront church, where they shake hands, share hymnals and sing with their faces uncovered.\\n\\n“It’s sad,” Kenny said. What he’d found in the genome was not just the transmission history of the coronavirus in his region. It was a record of humanity’s failures — of mistakes made and warnings missed and information withheld during those early months of the pandemic. In exposing what went wrong, it offered a guide to getting things right.\\n\\n“But we don’t learn from our mistakes,” Kenny said. “And we certainly don’t learn from science.”\\n\\nAlice Crites and Nate Jones in Washington contributed to this report.

Who knows. You look — take your hat off to the young because they have a hell of an immune system, but it affects virtually nobody.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“By the way, open your schools,” he added to cheers. “Everybody, open your schools.”\\n\\nThis riff of Trump’s that young people are less affected by covid-19 and, in some states, haven’t died from the disease isn’t new. (For a while, Trump would tell an anecdote about how the governor of New Jersey told him that only one young person had died from the disease.) What is less common from Trump is that flat “affects virtually nobody” claim, apparently centered on younger Americans.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt’s an assertion that’s both dangerously misleading and aggressively hypocritical.\\n\\nAs Trump spoke on Monday, the death toll from the pandemic in the United States was nearing the 200,000 mark, a boundary that Trump repeatedly insisted this spring and summer that we probably wouldn’t near.\\n\\nIt is true, to Trump’s point, that the vast majority of those deaths were among older Americans. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through mid-September indicate that nearly 8 in 10 deaths from covid-19 occurred among those who were 65 and older.\\n\\nBut it’s not the case that “virtually nobody” who is younger has been affected by the disease. About 400 people younger than 25 have succumbed to the virus, making up more than 1 out of every 100 deaths in that age group since February. Among those aged 25 to 64, 8 percent of all deaths in that period were the result of covid-19. Among those 65 and older, 9.8 percent of deaths since February were linked to the virus.\\n\\nOf course, death is only the worst possible outcome from contracting the virus. The American Academy of Pediatrics compiled data on how the virus affected children across the United States, finding that between 0.2 and 8 percent of kids who contract it end up being hospitalized. Children account for between 0.5 and 3.7 percent of all hospitalizations.\\n\\nDepending on the state, the group found, between 0 and 0.15 percent of children who contract the virus die.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat remains unknown is the long-term effects of the illness. There are signs that contracting the virus could lead to heart or lung damage that lasts far longer than the infection itself. It has been less than a year since the virus emerged, so it’s impossible to say how young people infected by the virus might be affected as they get older, if at all.\\n\\nWe can say one thing with certainty, though: Even 400 deaths among those 24 and younger — or, say, the 5,500 among those younger than 45 — would not be shrugged off by Trump had they been a function of a terrorist attack or of immigration.\\n\\nWhen a man drove into joggers and pedestrians in Manhattan on Halloween 2017, Trump mentioned the incident nearly two dozen times in the following few months. He falsely alleged that the attacker had abused immigration laws to bring a number of relatives to the United States and demanded that the laws be changed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe attack was a tragedy and an avoidable one. Eight people died.\\n\\nWe can outline any number of examples. When a husband and wife murdered 16 in San Bernardino, Calif., in December 2015, Trump demanded that the United States ban any Muslim from entering the country. When he was elected president, he tried to make that policy into law.\\n\\nSince 2001, the coronavirus has killed more people younger than 45 than have been killed in terrorist attacks — including the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\\n\\nThere’s obviously a difference between deaths from disease over a multi-month period and deaths in bursts of violence. But it’s also the case that Trump has, in the past, casually pledged to prevent deadly childhood illnesses.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine,” Trump pledged in March, describing what he hoped to accomplish if he won a second term. “Finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in less than nine years. We’ve already started.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCancer is likely to lead to the deaths of about 1,200 kids ages 14 and younger this year and another 540 deaths among those 15 to 19. Covid-19 has killed 400 people younger than 25, a group that Trump describes as “virtually nobody.”\\n\\nWhat this comes down to is politics. Trump benefits from railing about immigrants and terrorists as threats to the United States, bolstering his efforts to portray an unusual toughness. He similarly benefits from sweeping, nebulous claims about addressing childhood cancer, a horrible and awful disease.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd he benefits every time he convinces a voter that the coronavirus pandemic is not a big deal. That the people who died were going to die anyway and that everyone else emerges virtually untouched. Months into the pandemic, this sort of wheat-from-the-chaff approach to the death toll is familiar enough that we’re mostly immune to it — to Trump’s benefit.

Despite the Justice Department’s determination that the city is one of three that is permitting violence and destruction of property, things in the city seem pretty normal — at least by pandemic standards.\\n\\nWhen Trump decided this month that New York; Portland, Ore.; D.C.; and Seattle should be considered “anarchist jurisdictions” from which the government would withhold funding, the announcement was met with a very New York roll of the eyes from most observers. There were obviously two rationales for Trump’s executive order — his effort to portray heavily Democratic areas as rife with violence and crime and his repeatedly demonstrated interest in lashing out at the city where he grew up. That the Justice Department has now formally identified New York for admonition seems simply to have restarted the eye-rolling.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfter all, it doesn’t make much sense as an argument. While Portland has seen repeated incidents of violence since late May, when the country saw a surge in protests centered on police treatment of Black Americans, New York hasn’t. Data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project tracking protests and violence since that time shows a stark difference between what has unfolded in Oregon relative to New York.\\n\\nWhile Portland has seen violent confrontations (including during the period when federal law enforcement was deployed to the city in July), it’s still not the case that those demonstrations, largely focused on a federal courthouse, have significantly affected life in the city. Likewise in Seattle, where the establishment (and uprooting) of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone offered a brief period of actual anarchy, albeit for a few blocks.\\n\\nBut New York? There was a stretch in Manhattan in early June when there were riots and violent confrontations. Otherwise, though, things have been largely peaceful. That there have been a number of protests in the city is hardly an indicator of any particular shift; there are protests on a range of subjects in any given week in the city.\\n\\nUsually when Trump is attacking New York as dangerous, he’s focused not on protests but on crime. He likes to talk about how crime is up 300 percent in some cases.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs it stands, though, that’s not the case. The number of shooting incidents has doubled relative to 2019, which isn’t good, but other serious crimes, such as grand larceny and rape, are down significantly. The number of murders is up 40 percent over 2019, hitting 321 this year, with three months to go. By contrast, there were 649 murders in the city in 2001, the last year in which Trump’s ally Rudolph W. Giuliani served as mayor.\\n\\nIf the level of crime in New York now is a signal of anarchy, that’s a much bigger indictment of Giuliani than the city’s current leadership.\\n\\nTrump’s inclusion of New York City on his list of targets is clearly more about some combination of pique and politics than life on the ground. The city and the state it anchors have been consistent burrs under Trump’s saddle, from the launch of a range of investigations targeting him and his business by Attorney General Letitia James (D) to Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) having “Black lives matter” painted in large letters on Fifth Avenue outside Trump Tower.\\n\\nTrump’s attempts to bring New York to heel, though, extend beyond the “anarchist” claim. The city’s policy of offering undocumented immigrants certain protections from federal law enforcement has prompted the Trump administration to repeatedly threaten to withhold funding, including funding focused on the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this year, the federal government kicked New Yorkers out of a federal program facilitating security processes at airports, again ostensibly because of sanctuary policies — but also potentially for political reasons.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe president’s most dramatic rejection of the city where he grew up came last fall, when he announced that he was officially moving to Florida. The move had some positive implications for Trump (swing state, potentially avoiding some of the aforementioned investigations) but also marked a significant shift in Trump’s public persona. No longer was he the outer-borough kid who made good in Manhattan, the celeb who worked Page Six with the best of them. Now, admittedly not unlike other older New Yorkers, he sought warmer climes.\\n\\nIt’s clear that Trump sees New York as a useful foil, a representation of the sort of America that many of his supporters view with skepticism. New York is the Bad Place where Bad, Immoral Things Happen. It is a hub of the Coastal Elites against whom he is fighting on their behalf.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/undecided-voters-2020-presidential-debates/2020/09/27/0911c650-fd9e-11ea-8d05-9beaaa91c71f_story.html', 'Full Text': 'The Boltzes, who live in a rural area half an hour outside Pittsburgh, find themselves squarely between their children. Their son who lives next door is more conservative than they are and supports Trump. Their daughter in Seattle and their son in Chicago, whom they hope to see soon happily married to his male partner, are adamant that Trump be removed.\\n\\n“It’s an interesting place to sit as parents,” said Marlin, 63 and recently retired after a long career at a machine manufacturing company. “We consider ourselves as moderate. Conservative on fiscal issues and liberal on gay marriage. There are no candidates that fit. If I had a spreadsheet, I’d be trying to fill it out to say: Who do I think can pull the country back together? I have never been this undecided this close to an election.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen the first of three debates between Trump and Biden begins Tuesday evening, as many as 1 in 10 voters — enough to swing the election either way — will still be searching for the thing that finally seals their choice. National polls in recent days have reported that anywhere from 3 percent to 11 percent of voters are unsure or might yet switch sides.\\n\\nThese undecideds have heard the jokes and insults aimed at people who can’t see the differences between Trump and Biden, but that does nothing to ease their doubts. In interviews, these battleground-state voters spoke of feeling a civic duty to remain open to the candidates’ pitches on Tuesday night, and a desire to see how they perform under pressure.\\n\\nMany still like the idea of Trump as disrupter, the non-politician giving the Washington system a hefty dose of shock treatment, yet they are appalled by his languid approach to the coronavirus pandemic or disgusted by his antipathy toward immigrants and refugees.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMany have always liked Biden, but they worry about whether he’s lost a step or about whether he would stand up to the left wing of his own party.\\n\\n“I’ll decide based on the debates,” said George Cottingham, a 25-year-old music production student in Racine, Wis. “I want to see a sense of purpose. I always can tell if someone’s competent by seeing how they present themselves.”\\n\\nCottingham will be casting his first vote in a presidential election, but he liked Trump in 2016 and is leaning toward him again this time.\\n\\nHe said he sees the coronavirus as a greater threat than Trump seems to, but he says the president’s skepticism about wearing masks is a reasonable ploy: “Honestly, everyone should be wearing a mask, but Trump says things against it to keep people from freaking out, and I get it that he’s trying to keep everything together.”\\n\\nSome undecideds turn out to be people who’ve long felt alienated from the two big political parties, who voted for Libertarian Gary Johnson or Green Party candidate Jill Stein in 2016 and now think their vote may have greater impact if they can make their peace with Biden or Trump.\\n\\nRoan Kirschbaum, 28, who studies sound design in Oshkosh, Wis., and is looking for work, has voted only for Green Party candidates in the past, but he’s open to either Trump or Biden this time and hopes they’ll use the debate to address how social media platforms are warping the country’s political discussion by feeding people evermore extreme views.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It’s a vicious attack on human well-being and I don’t hear either candidate talking about it,” he said.\\n\\nKirschbaum said that although Trump “is better than Biden at listening to the American people, the problem is then he just doesn’t care about doing what’s right. Like on the virus, he wanted to keep people from panicking, but he won’t admit that it’s good to wear masks. Would it be any different under Democratic leadership? Biden is more pro-science, but I don’t know.”\\n\\nSome undecided voters aren’t really voters at all. They belong to the faction that in most presidential elections is just as big as the Democrats or Republicans — non-voters.\\n\\nPete Jordan’s indecision is rooted in exhaustion. An independent who leans Democratic, he voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and said he wanted her “to win real bad. It didn’t happen. I was punched in the throat.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Jordan’s distaste for Trump has diminished over time. He can’t stomach Fox News’s cheerleading for the president, but he also thinks CNN and MSNBC became “a joke” by railing against Trump no matter what.\\n\\n“Everybody knows the guy’s an a------, but do I have to hear it 24/7/365?” asked Jordan, who lives in Becker County, Minn., near the North Dakota border and not far from where Trump held a rally last week.\\n\\nStill, he said, “Donald Trump got elected and my 401(k) went up about 35 percent, so how can I hate the man for that? But his narcissistic brain won’t allow him to shut his piehole. He has to be the center of attention. Shut up and govern.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJordan’s view of the Democrats has soured over time: He thought Democratic senators grilled Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh too harshly over allegations of past sexual assault. And closer to home in Minnesota, the violence that followed Black Lives Matter protests after George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police deepened his disillusionment.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJordan, 57, plans to watch the debates hoping Biden will give him a reason to vote for him. But if the election were held tomorrow, he said, he would likely stay home.\\n\\n“I’m so up in the air right now,” he said. “I just don’t have the patience for all this s--- anymore.”\\n\\nAfter discounting leaners, third-party voters and non-voters, there remain a solid group of people who are simply stuck between Trump and Biden. Many, like Karen and Marlin Boltz, are social liberals and fiscal conservatives who find no echo of their beliefs in Washington politics.\\n\\nThe Boltzes, lifelong Republicans, want the debates to reveal what they say news coverage of the campaign has not: Who will address the cost of health care? Who will support protests for racial justice but stand firm against violence? Who can actually bring people together?\\n\\nFour years ago, the couple watched the debates and liked Trump’s outsider stance but worried that he made outrageous slurs against immigrants.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“They have made it impossible for anyone to come here,” Karen said. “Why would you do that?”\\n\\n“I thought Trump was saying all this stuff about the wall but once he gets advisers, they will pull him back,” Marlin said. “But that didn’t happen. And I didn’t see the tweets coming. I don’t like it. It’s not very presidential-like.”\\n\\nThe Boltzes pray before dinner, attend church every Sunday and believe America should be proud to be a destination for people who live under repressive regimes around the world.\\n\\n“This ‘America First’ thing doesn’t sit well with me,” Marlin said. “The GOP promotes a view of the world of scarcity. As if there is not enough to go around. And I don’t see that. There’s plenty to go around.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKaren avoids watching cable news because it seems like wall-to-wall Trump denunciation or adulation, depending on the channel. She listens to NPR every morning because the reporting seems more factual. But she’ll watch the debates to try to see for herself whether Trump “might be crazier and more wild in the next four years” or if Biden can avoid a huge expansion of the public sector.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“We don’t want the government to be our mum,” Karen said.\\n\\nA thousand miles west, in rural Minnesota, where Erin Tollefsrud teaches refugee children and is a single mother of her own son, that same wish for a president who is openhearted yet tightfisted hangs over her anticipation of the debate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTollefsrud, 35, thought early this year that she’d finally found a candidate who reflects her concerns about climate change, education and racial justice. She liked Andrew Yang in the Democratic primary race, but now she’s torn. She’s suspicious of Democrats like Biden who she sees as unfamiliar with and unsympathetic to rural residents and gun owners.\\n\\nBut she’s appalled by Trump’s Twitter persona and coarse rhetoric at rallies. And she’s worried that “there’s no fiscal conservative in this race.”\\n\\nStill, she likes the attention Trump pays to rural America and she thinks of him as someone who doesn’t flip-flop, who tells it like it is.\\n\\n“Neither candidate represents me,” she said. “Both are old, white, male and rich.”\\n\\nTollefsrud is a classic swing voter, casting ballots for George W. Bush and Barack Obama before going with a third-party candidate in 2016. On Tuesday, she wants to hear whether Biden can hold his own against Trump’s insults.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“His age is concerning,” she said. “If you look at pictures of presidents after their term, they look older, stressed, harried.”\\n\\nBiden’s age and acuity — he would be the oldest president in U.S. history, three years older than Trump — and Trump’s lack of an agenda or principles has Paul Jass stuck in a too familiar place: undecided, with the debates standing as his primary hope for finding clarity.\\n\\nJass, a chemist who lives near Milwaukee, defines himself as a social liberal, especially on climate and natural resources issues, and fiscal conservative who used to be comfortable in the Republican Party. But not in recent years: In 2016, he voted for Gary Johnson, the ex-governor of New Mexico who served as a Republican but made his White House run as a Libertarian. Before that, he voted for Republican John McCain in 2008 and Democrat Obama in 2012.\\n\\nIn the debate, Jass wants to hear a science-based plan for restraining spread of the virus and a coherent approach to restarting the economy. He’s not holding his breath.\\n\\nJass has been perplexed by Trump’s refusal to take the advice of scientists. “He tried to put too much of a false front on to make the virus situation not look so bad,” he said. “He thinks he knows it all. As a person, I really don’t like him. And he’s not a Republican at all.”\\n\\nBut Trump has done some things Jass likes, including closing tax loopholes, evening the playing field for U.S. manufacturers, and brokering peace between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors.\\n\\nBiden’s campaign has left Jass flat so far. “His message is scattered for me other than ‘I don’t like Trump,’ ” he said. “I want to hear a clear philosophy of government. But I really think Biden’s going to win and win handily.”\\n\\nWhile many undecideds eagerly await the debates as a way to clarify their choice, others hold little hope that the TV spectacles will help — or that their vote will do any good.\\n\\nScott Williams has never voted before but is already somewhat apathetic about his first presidential election.\\n\\n“I can’t blink without something telling me I need to go register to vote,” said Williams, 21, a junior at Concordia University in St. Paul, Minn. “They’re really, really hellbent on getting youth to vote right now.”\\n\\nWilliams plans to watch the debate with his girlfriend. He’s curious about how Trump and Biden will interact with one another. And after losing his restaurant job at the start of the pandemic and then finding part-time work at another eatery, he’s especially interested in hearing how the candidates would curb the coronavirus “so we don’t have to worry or practice social distancing.”\\n\\nBut he’s underwhelmed by both candidates. He sees Trump as simply unqualified to serve. And Biden is “another old guy.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/24/what-else-should-chris-wallace-ask/', 'Full Text': 'Mr. President, the Confederate battle flag was the standard symbol for white supremacists who committed treason against the United States.

Some 68 percent of respondents told YouGov between August 2019 and August 2020 that they have a positive opinion of PBS, making the service more popular than awards-dominating HBO and putting it on the heels of streaming giant Netflix. A Pew Research Center study on polarization and the American media published in January found that PBS is one of just three outlets — from among 30 choices — trusted by Americans of both parties more than they distrust it.\\n\\nPaula Kerger, the president and chief executive of PBS, says that trust starts close to home. Even if viewers are skeptical of the media writ large, she argues, they trust journalists who are a part of their own community.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSmall rural stations are helped by shared branding and programming, while the service’s urban behemoths benefit from the member stations’ insights and roots.\\n\\nPBS also does more than take kids to the Land of Make Believe and their parents to English country houses. “American Portrait,” for instance, uses audience submissions to power on-air programming and events. This structure relies on two core assumptions: that the lives of ordinary Americans are newsworthy; and that people are interesting to each other, and not simply as objects of partisan contempt or scorn.\\n\\nSome of PBS’s most popular programming also speaks to fundamental questions that can get steamrolled on more frenetic news networks, or marginalized by channels eager to make “prestige TV” and profits.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn a time of “patriotic education” programs and falling monuments, PBS attempts to navigate a more personal approach to what Kerger calls “a hunger for us to understand where we came from.” The long-running hit “Antiques Roadshow” is about more than the excitement of potentially striking gold in one’s attic. Part of the appeal is discovering a material connection to the past — individual and collective.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPBS is making space for ambiguity and discomfort with social issues, as well as for nostalgia. Henry Louis Gates Jr.’s “Finding Your Roots” does this with his famous guests’ family trees. The show engages uncomfortable parts of the American story. White guests may grapple with finding out that they’re descended from enslavers. Black guests may learn of an ancestor’s accomplishments, previously obscured by a whitewashed historical record.\\n\\nKerger points to the way director Ken Burns and co-director Lynn Novick brought together veterans, protesters and Vietnamese immigrants around their series “The Vietnam War” as events that enabled people to have “conversations that you could never have” under ordinary circumstances.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOther examples abound: “Nature” and “NOVA” speak to audiences’ desire to understand humanity’s place in the natural order and how that order functions. You can guess Americans’ ages by whether their first fictional home away from home was “Sesame Street,” “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” or “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood.” The British import “Downton Abbey” was the rare prime-time destination that was genuinely appropriate for and interesting to multigenerational families.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOne could dismiss these programs and their objectives as inadequate to resolving larger social disputes, or as too vague to be meaningful. But PBS’s first 50 years have been a rebuke to that sort of cynicism. The service’s endurance is itself an argument that there continues to be an audience for the reaffirmation of good values that Fred Rogers practiced for 33 years; for an approach that prioritizes shedding “light rather than heat” on the news; for looking back to move forward when both past and present seem painful and uncertain.\\n\\nIn short: for actually talking and listening to each other.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKerger saw PBS’s uniting power up close on a visit to Morning Fill Up, a regular gathering in Rapid City, S.D. She expected the 7 a.m. conclave, at a former car-repair shop, to be a bust. Instead, 200 people turned out.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“People want to be engaged. They want to be part of something that is important,” Kerger says. When she considers projects, she thinks not only of whether it could be “great television” but also whether it would resonate with the crowd in Rapid City “to really create the kind of conversation that some people are hungering to have.”\\n\\nPBS has made it to 50 by giving Americans a lot to talk about and teaching them how to do it.

But the essence of diversity is in nuance as well as numbers.\\n\\nThe new rules are sort of like a prix fixe menu: Starting in 2024, movies that want to compete for Best Picture must prove that their makers aimed to be inclusive on a number of levels, but they can pick exactly how they want to establish their bona fides from a list of options provided by the academy. Producers can cast racially or ethnically diverse leads. Or they can assemble broadly diverse casts and tell stories “centered on an underrepresented group(s).” Or hire members of minority and underrepresented communities in key behind-the-scenes roles. Or provide internship and training opportunities on set.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNew York Magazine’s Mark Harris and Vox’s Emily VanDerWerff have pointed out that it won’t be terribly difficult for lots of movies — particularly those made by large studios that already have large, diverse staffs and established internship programs — to qualify. Still, those efforts could have an impact. As Variety critic Clayton Davis put it in an op-ed, “The Academy isn’t telling Picasso what to put in his paintings. Still, if he wants to submit his artwork for an Oscar, he’s got to use more vibrant colors or invite a local young painter to watch his process.”\\n\\nAcademics such as Martha Lauzen at San Diego State University and Stacy L. Smith of the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism have long done studies documenting Hollywood’s homogeneity both on- and off-screen. By setting concrete targets for movies that hope to be Best Picture, the academy is providing a real incentive to improve those figures.\\n\\nStill, numbers are just one way to talk about representation in Hollywood, and they can be a crude aspect of the conversation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nConsider this hypothetical: A biopic about a pathbreaking transgender woman is getting Oscar buzz, and while 30 percent of the ensemble cast is made up of LGBT people of color, the lead is played by a cisgender woman. The producers insist that casting an established star was crucial to getting the movie financed, even though the actress doesn’t share a gender identity with the character she’s playing. The movie more than meets the requirements for on-screen diversity to be eligible for Best Picture. But is the film an actual victory for diversity if it reaffirms a message that transgender actors aren’t bankable or interesting to mainstream audiences?\\n\\nThe rules also seem destined to stir debate over who is “underrepresented” — and maybe even over who is considered White. The academy lists Asian, Hispanic/Latinx, Black/African American, Indigenous/Native American/Alaska Native, Middle Eastern/North African and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander as communities it considers underrepresented on the big screen. But it also leaves an opening for “Other underrepresented race or ethnicity.”\\n\\nThe questions that invites are nearly endless. How should the academy consider a movie like “Parasite,” Bong Joon Ho’s South Korean class tragicomedy? That film was directed by and stars people who are underrepresented on American movie screens but who are members of the ethnic majority where the movie was shot. Will there be content qualifications, say, if a film stars a Middle Eastern actor but gives him or her a cliche role as a terrorist?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAre Jews White? If not, are we arguably overrepresented in movies and television — or should Hasidic and Orthodox Jews be considered underrepresented? In America, Irish and Italian immigrants and their descendants were once considered distinct from other White people, but became assimilated into a larger White identity over time. How will the Oscars consider movies about people who might be considered White in the United States, but whose ethnic identities take on a different valance in Europe, like Russians or Slavs?\\n\\nAll of this, and I haven’t even gotten started on what it means that the new academy rules don’t contemplate underrepresentation on the basis of class and religion.\\n\\nIn the best of all possible worlds, these changes to the Oscar rules will result not merely in a more diverse awards show, but in an entertainment industry that more meaningfully represents the world at large. That may be the ultimate measure of success for the academy.

For years, a higher percentage of Republicans have said that the United States has “a unique character that makes it the greatest country in the world,” but the gap has widened dramatically since Trump was elected.\\n\\nIn 2012, 85 percent of Republicans and 66 percent of Democrats said the United States was the greatest nation. Today, 80 percent of Republicans still say that, but among Democrats, it has fallen to 35 percent, down 21 percentage points since 2017, Trump’s first year in office. More than 3 in 5 Democrats (64 percent) now say the United States is no greater than other countries.\\n\\nAn assessment of future threats to U.S. vital interests — and therefore policy priorities — also highlights the deep differences between Republicans and Democrats. Not one of the top five threats identified by Democrats makes the top five identified by Republicans. Democrats see threats both internally and externally, while Republicans see the threats mostly coming from outside U.S. borders.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor Democrats, the five leading threats to U.S. vital interests are, in order, the coronavirus pandemic, climate change, racial inequality in the United States, foreign interference in U.S. elections and economic inequality in this country.\\n\\nFor Republicans, the top five threats to vital U.S. interests are the development of China as a world power, international terrorism, large numbers of immigrants and refugees coming into the country, domestic violent extremism and Iran’s nuclear program.\\n\\nLess than a quarter of Republicans say income inequality or racial inequality represent threats to vital U.S. interests. While 87 percent of Democrats say the coronavirus represents a threat to those vital interests — and 60 percent of independents agree — 48 percent of Republicans say the same. A majority of Republicans say the U.S. government’s response to the pandemic has been effective, although more say it has been “somewhat effective” than “very effective.” They ranked the pandemic ninth in importance out of 15 potential threats.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRepublicans and Democrats agree on the sixth-leading threat, a global economic downturn, but then part company on the seventh, with 53 percent of Republicans citing North Korea’s nuclear program and 59 percent of Democrats naming political polarization in the United States.\\n\\nThe Chicago Council analysis argues that, because Democrats express “deep disappointment” with the government’s handling of the pandemic, climate change, domestic inequality and foreign interference, the percentage of them viewing the United States as the greatest country in the world has dropped sharply.\\n\\nDemocrats have watched the effects of the coronavirus pandemic and concluded that more cooperation and collaboration with other nations is needed to solve global issues, a view shared by 80 percent of those who identify themselves as Democrats. Republicans take the opposite view, with 58 percent saying the pandemic shows that the United States should become more self-sufficient and less reliant on other countries, and 40 percent saying the pandemic should lead to more cooperation internationally.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThese differences exist even as about 2 in 3 Americans, including clear majorities across partisan lines, say the United States should play an active role in the world. But fewer than 1 in 3 overall want the United States’ role to be a dominant one. Still more — over two-thirds — prefer that the U.S. role be shared with other nations. Most Americans agree with the argument that problems such as climate change and pandemics are so large and complex that only through cooperative efforts can they be dealt with adequately.\\n\\nDespite the differences of opinion between members of the two major parties, support for security alliances is at or near an all-time high, according to the survey, and this includes accepting decisions that are not necessarily the preferred approach by the United States. Most Americans see the transatlantic alliances as mutually beneficial to the United States and European allies and remain committed to NATO, which Trump has challenged and at times questioned during his presidency. But Democratic support is much higher than Republican support — 85 percent versus 65 percent.\\n\\nMeanwhile, there is majority support for decreasing U.S. troop strength in Germany, as the president has called for, and a small percentage of Americans now favor pulling all troops out of that country.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAttitudes toward China have turned negative in the past few years. On a scale of 1 to 100, with 100 being most favorable, views of China are at 32 on average, down from 45 two years ago and from a high of 53 in 1986. A majority now see the development of China as a world power as a critical threat, and even more say the United States should build up relations with Japan and South Korea, even at the expense of relations with China, rather than prioritize China over traditional allies.\\n\\nRepublicans favor taking a harder line in the U.S. approach to China, with about 2 in 3 saying the United States should “actively work to limit the growth of China’s power,” limit the number of Chinese students allowed into the country and restrict scientific exchanges. An even bigger percentage of Republicans favor increased tariffs on Chinese goods and slightly more support reducing overall trade with China, even at the cost of higher prices for goods.\\n\\nLarge majorities of both Republicans and Democrats favor putting sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for human rights abuses, stopping U.S. companies from selling sensitive technology equipment to China and seeking to negotiate arms-control agreements between the two countries.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Republicans favor a nationalist foreign policy that hinges on self-reliance and autonomy and that promotes the use of more direct, forceful means to achieve US goals,” the council report said. “These means include maintaining superior military power, economic pressure, independence in decision making, and a more confrontational approach toward China.”\\n\\nThe Chicago Council survey was conducted online July 2-19, 2020, among 2,111 adults nationwide.

We’re now used to lower-third text in his speeches correcting his false claims in real-time. In mid-to-late 2015, though, that expectation didn’t exist, nor was there a massive database of his past falsehoods that made fact-checking his rhetoric fairly rote. Trump’s demagogic attacks on immigrants echoed a refrain in conservative media even if they didn’t comport with reality — and people tuning in got that rhetoric poured directly into their eyes and ears.\\n\\nBy the general election, the media was wiser to Trump’s game; once he became president, there was an expectation among non-sycophantic outlets that his various speeches and events should be shown only after-the-fact or with qualifiers meant to limit his ability to spread misinformation. Trump infected the discourse in 2015, and by 2017 the media knew enough to apply appropriate shields and keep a generous distance. It wasn’t always able or willing to do so — Trump’s favorite network, Fox News, takes the same precautions with his misinformation as some of its hosts do with the coronavirus — but there was at least a sense that it was necessary.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat’s one of several reasons that Trump hasn’t enjoyed the same roughshod command of the media as he did four years ago. His rallies are by now familiar affairs, of diminished newsworthiness in the same way that the existence of sunny weather in Arizona rarely leads local broadcasts. There are still online shops that carry his rallies regularly without a filter, but thanks to increased wariness, decreased novelty and the constraints of the pandemic, it’s rare that Trump gets a chance to simply riff at millions of Americans without anyone holding him to account.\\n\\nAt least, until Tuesday night.\\n\\nGeneral-election debates are normally a moment of remarkable austerity in a presidential campaign. All of the riffing and chatter is set aside as the two (or, occasionally, more) candidates struggle with all due sobriety over policy and legislative proposals. In the buffet that is an election, debates are the side salad: the healthy thing you get because you recognize you probably should, even if you don’t relish it. At least in normal times.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis year, it’s easy to expect that the debates will be something distinctly different. Trump is trailing former vice president Joe Biden by a significant margin, and the debates are among the last times he might be able to shift the direction of a largely static race.\\n\\nMore importantly, Tuesday night’s debate is being held on largely friendly turf, without the sort of filters that often impede Trump’s ability to say things that aren’t true. Its host is Fox News’s Chris Wallace, perhaps the most objective possible interlocutor from Trump’s preferred network, but by no means the moderator most likely to hold Trump to account for falsehoods.\\n\\nIn fact, Wallace has said as much.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“One of these two people is going to be the next president of the United States, and my job is to be as invisible as possible,” Wallace said during his regularly programmed show on Sunday. “If I’ve done my job right, at the end of the night people will say: ‘That was a great debate. Who was the moderator?'”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn normal times, that’s an admirable sentiment. But in 2020, it’s like a guard at an art museum suggesting that he will try his best not to be in the way of people carrying paintings out the front door.\\n\\nWallace has already made one concession that benefits Trump. The debate is broken out into a number of segments focused on different topics defined by Wallace: the pandemic, the economy and so on.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd then there’s “Race and Violence in Our Cities.” It’s an objectively baffling grouping, tying “race” and “violence” together in the first place and then defining those merged subjects as most important when manifested in urban areas. Race in suburbia and violence in rural areas? Not important. What’s important is all of that violence and, uh, race that’s happening in cities. It’s a framing that fits squarely with Trump’s campaign branding in a way that Biden would be hard-pressed to match. It’s not just that Trump wants to talk about crime and race, it’s that Trump wants to talk about those things in precisely the way that Wallace has suggested they will.\\n\\nThat Wallace has teed up Trump and simultaneously promised to be demure in guiding the conversation is an important consideration because Trump on Tuesday will be offering his commentary to what’s likely to be the largest concentrated group of people he will get between now and the election. In the 12 presidential election campaigns that have included televised debates, the first iteration was the most-watched, according to data from Nielsen.\\n\\nTens of millions of people will likely tune in, and Trump will say the things he says without any objective party offering context. This depends on where the viewer is watching, of course; there may still be the sorts of on-screen text correcting the record that some cable networks have deployed. But they still will be broadcasting Trump’s false claims and assertions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere will be someone else on the stage with Trump and Wallace, of course: Joe Biden. When Wallace was moderating a debate in 2016, he declared that it was up to Trump’s then-opponent, Hillary Clinton, to correct what he said. Fair enough — except that Trump’s willingness (eagerness!) to say false things will necessarily demand that Biden leave some portion of them unaddressed. Or it will mean that all of Biden’s time is spent on rebutting Trump’s claims, meaning much of the conversation would be dominated by the subjects that Trump wants to discuss.\\n\\nThere’s not really a good solution here. Even a proactive moderator can’t spend the entire debate correcting the record, for a variety of reasons. Trump knows this; he’s perfected the approach of flooding the zone with nonsense, knowing that much of it will get through.\\n\\nPhilippe Reines, a former Clinton staffer who served as her opponent in her 2016 practice sessions, offered Biden some advice in an interview with Politico.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“They don’t have opening statements,” Reines suggested, “but I would start with 'I’ve served with and for eight presidents before you, and I never thought I would say this to a president but most of what you hear from him tonight will be false.’”\\n\\nThis gets at the overarching context of the moment. If you understand that President Trump frequently says things that are untrue, that he lies and misleads and misstates, Biden’s warning won’t be necessary. If, on the other hand, you reject the idea that Trump is uniquely prone to falsehood or believe him to be the straight-shooter he claims to be, you’re not going to accept his opponent’s effort at inoculation.\"}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/ginsburg-capitol-court-trump/2020/09/25/8cf017be-ff2f-11ea-8d05-9beaaa91c71f_story.html', 'Full Text': '“Her life and leadership cemented the truth that all men and women are created equal,” Pelosi said in a statement issued after brief remarks at the ceremony.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGinsburg, who served for 27 years and was the second female justice on the Supreme Court, died Sept. 18 at 87 of complications from cancer. She will be buried in a private ceremony next week at Arlington National Cemetery alongside her husband, Marty.\\n\\nHer casket rested upon the Lincoln catafalque as Rabbi Lauren Holtzblatt offered a eulogy and Denyce Graves, one of opera aficionado Ginsburg’s favorite singers, offered a traditional spiritual, “Deep River,” and a patriotic song, “American Anthem,” in somber serenade.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFormer vice president Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, and his wife, Jill, traveled to the Capitol to honor Ginsburg.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut it was the women of Congress who played the most noticeable — albeit silent — role, making up the majority of the invitation-only guests at the brief memorial service. When Ginsburg’s casket departed the Capitol, the lawmakers stood in line on the steps of the East Front, hands over their hearts, to bid her farewell.\\n\\n“What she did for women not only has changed our country, but I think has changed the world,” said Rep. Susan Brooks (R-Ind.), who was one of a handful of Republican women to pay their respects to Ginsburg.\\n\\nLying in state is the United States’s highest form of tribute, normally reserved for presidents, military leaders and other distinguished lawmakers. Ginsburg is only the second Supreme Court justice to receive the honor; the late president William Howard Taft, who also was chief justice, lay in state in 1930.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Look at all the men on the Supreme Court — I doubt that this kind of tribute will be paid to any of them,” said Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), who was assistant legal director at the ACLU shortly before Ginsburg launched its Women’s Rights Project, where she argued six landmark gender discrimination cases before the Supreme Court. She won five, cementing equal access to mortgages, banking services, jury representation and pension, caregiving and military benefits.\\n\\n“Her most brilliant work was done in winning those five women’s rights cases,” Holmes Norton said.\\n\\nFemale lawmakers said the precedent-setting recognition for Ginsburg was a testament to how dramatically women’s rights have changed as a result of her lifetime crusade.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) recalled how earlier this summer, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), the youngest woman in Congress, delivered a floor speech to protest an insult from a male congressman and a “culture” that normalizes “violent language against women.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“If I had done that when I was younger, I would have been fired, I wouldn’t have had a job . . . people do not understand that that was really the experience of a lot of people of my generation,” Dingell said, reflecting on Ginsburg’s work. “She brought to the courts, to everything that she did — she experienced it . . . and she is the first generation. I am where I am because she helped open the doors.”\\n\\nRep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), the youngest Republican woman in Congress, said she credited Ginsburg and the women of her generation with paving the way for others to break barriers, “even if you disagreed with some of her decisions.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“She really lived so many generational changes that women faced,” Stefanik said. “She’s the first but she will not be the last to lie in state.”\\n\\nAbsent from the ceremony were many of the top congressional Republicans, a reminder of the political fight over President Trump’s plans to nominate conservative Judge Amy Coney Barrett to replace the liberal icon within weeks of the election. An announcement is planned Saturday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGinsburg’s dying wish was for the next president to choose her successor, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is moving swiftly to fill the seat as voters are casting early ballots.\\n\\nMcConnell did not attend the service; his spokesman declined to comment on his whereabouts or schedule. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) also did not attend.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA Pelosi spokesman said McConnell and McCarthy were invited. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) was the seniormost Republican in attendance.\\n\\nDemocrats said the current political crossroads weighed on them as they reflected on Ginsburg’s legacy.\\n\\n“We owe so much to her, and we have to recommit ourselves to continue the fight for justice and equality for all in this country,” Rep. Nydia M. Velázquez (D-N.Y.) said. “That journey continues . . . not only in the hall of Congress, but corporate boards and for Black and Brown people, immigrants, especially women.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, said Ginsburg had cleared a path for women like her to thrive.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It’s very important, I think, that in the midst of being 39 days away from an election that we honor one of the, I think, greatest Americans, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in terms of all that she did, all that she inspired, all that she empowered, both legally and just in terms of the way she lived her life,” Harris told reporters after attending the service.\\n\\nAsked whether Ginsburg had cleared a path for her, Harris, who served as attorney general in California before her election to the Senate, said, “Absolutely.”\\n\\n“Because she first of all made America see what leadership looks like, and in the law, in terms of public service, and she broke so many barriers,” Harris said. “And I know that she did it intentionally, knowing that people like me could follow.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhile most mourners paid tribute silently, one stood out for his physical display. Bryant Johnson, Ginsburg’s personal trainer, dropped to the ground and did three full push-ups in front of the flag-draped casket. Even in her advanced years, Ginsburg continued to do strength training with Johnson, who had been her trainer for two decades.\\n\\nA pioneer and a cultural icon, Ginsburg also is the first Jewish person to lie in state.\\n\\n“Today we stand in sorrow, and tomorrow we the people must carry on Justice Ginsburg’s legacy,” Holtzblatt, whose husband, Ari, clerked for Ginsburg, said in her eulogy. “She was our prophet, our North Star, our strength, for so very long. Now, she must be permitted to rest after toiling so hard for every single one of us.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/supreme-court-conservative-majority/2020/09/26/a7c423ce-ff7e-11ea-8d05-9beaaa91c71f_story.html', 'Full Text': 'One would have to go back to Richard Nixon to find a first-term president whose nominees have so reshaped its direction, and for decades to come.\\n\\nThat change is likely to mean a lower bar for laws that restrict abortion.

It will be a surprise if affirmative action and other race-conscious programs survive another challenge.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd whether the public continues to see the court as the government’s most functional branch — or if radical restructuring is pursued — is on the line as well.\\n\\nFate, and political hardball by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), has presented Trump the chance to replace a legendary justice from the right, Antonin Scalia; the iconic leader of the left, Ruth Bader Ginsburg; and the man who for more than a decade occupied the pivotal spot in the middle, Anthony M. Kennedy.\\n\\nThe change has followed a calamitous path. Democrats claim Trump’s first appointee, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, 53, occupies a “stolen” seat — McConnell refused to hold a hearing for then-President Barack Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to fill the 2016 Scalia vacancy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, 55, was a wrenching, hard-to-watch drama that divided the nation over whether he assaulted Christine Blasey Ford as a teenager or was the victim of a left-wing smear aimed to keep him off the court.\\n\\nAnd consider the current scenario: Barrett, the 48-year-old ideological opposite of the woman she would replace, could be locked in to her lifetime appointment days before — or even after — her political benefactor, and his quest for a second term, is rejected by voters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe justices testify endlessly that they put aside partisan impulses when they put on the robe. So the president did the court no favor when he said his political future might depend on getting his nominee confirmed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I think this will end up in the Supreme Court. And I think it’s very important that we have nine justices,” Trump said during the buildup to the nomination. “It’s better if you go before the election, because I think this scam that the Democrats are pulling — it’s a scam — the scam will be before the United States Supreme Court. And I think having a 4-to-4 situation is not a good situation.”\\n\\nIt is difficult for the public to see the court as politically neutral “when a primary reason being given in favor of an expedited Senate confirmation hearing is . . . so the new justice can be there in time to vote in a way that will ensure the reelection of the president who just nominated them,” said Richard J. Lazarus, a Harvard University law professor who studies the court.\\n\\nTrump’s calculations seem to put Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., nominated by President George W. Bush in 2005, in the side against him.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRoberts in the most recent term joined with the court’s liberals to strike a restrictive Louisiana abortion law; declare the administration had not followed the law in trying to abolish the program protecting undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children; and, along with Gorsuch, reject the administration’s view that federal anti-discrimination law does not protect LGBTQ workers.\\n\\nBut likely the most stinging for Trump was that Roberts wrote the opinions dismissing his claims that he had immunity while in office from complying with investigations by congressional committees and a New York prosecutor, each seeking the president’s personal financial records.\\n\\n“No citizen, not even the president, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding,” Roberts wrote in the prosecutor case, and he stitched together seven justices to agree with that outcome, including Gorsuch and Kavanaugh.\\n\\nBut Roberts is hardly a liberal.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“The chief justice seemed to be guided last term by institutional concerns in particular in shifting to the left in some of the more contentious cases, but he has a conservative track record by almost any measure,” said Gregory G. Garre, who represented the government at the Supreme Court as solicitor general under Bush.\\n\\nThe common wisdom, attributed to the late justice Byron White, is that each new justice creates a new court. But each variation is known as the Roberts court.\\n\\nThe intriguing question always has been what Roberts’s role would have been if he were not the chief justice, but simply an associate justice.\\n\\n“Have we seen the real John Roberts?” asked Melissa Murray, a liberal New York University law professor who helps run a podcast about the court. Like others, she finds it hard to imagine him aligning with liberals if it means he is on the losing side of a 5-to-4 vote.\\n\\nThe chief justice’s vote counts no more than any other justice’s, and his colleagues have made it clear they work with him, not for him. But the chief justice does have one institutional power: He can either write the opinion in a case when he is in the majority, or decide who does.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe has used it at times to pump the brakes when more conservative justices would like to advance the law further and faster, or to keep liberals in line when their only chance to prevail is with his vote.\\n\\nThe chief justice’s approach, which last term avoided deciding many of the court’s most high-profile cases based on 5-to-4 ideological votes, proved popular with the public. A Gallup poll showed a majority of Democrats and Republicans approved of the court’s performance, a rare feat in this polarized political climate.\\n\\nRoberts’s influence will be diminished if he is not the person in the middle between four justices more conservative than he is, and four more liberal.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNot all of his conservative colleagues are as concerned as he is about shifting the court’s jurisprudence swiftly; that is what worries liberals most about a new court erasing long-standing protections for minority groups or abortion rights.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe court’s longest-serving member, Justice Clarence Thomas, has been clear in his belief that the court should not be shy about overturning precedent when a majority thinks the original case was wrongly decided.\\n\\nWhen it comes to constitutional cases, the woman who could become Thomas’s junior partner seems to be on the same wavelength.\\n\\n“I tend to agree with those who say a justice’s duty is to the Constitution,” Barrett wrote in a 2013 article for the Texas Law Review, “and that it is thus more legitimate for her to enforce her best understanding of the Constitution rather than a precedent she thinks clearly in conflict with it.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere is little reason to believe Roberts would be unhappy with additional conservative outcomes, but he prefers an incremental pace that prepares the public for change.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“A 6-to-3 court would shift power from the chief justice as the deciding vote in the more contentious cases to the more conservative justices. And Justice Kavanaugh may find himself as the crucial fifth vote in cases,” Garre said.\\n\\n“But Justice Kavanaugh, who aligned with the chief justice in more than 90 percent of the cases last term, seems to share the chief’s institutional concerns.”\\n\\nPredictions about the court are difficult until the results of the election are known. “The idea that the court operates in a vacuum is just fiction,” Murray said.\\n\\nAnd the election of Democrat Joe Biden and a Democratic Senate “would really accelerate and amplify the calls for reform,” she said, such as adding seats to the court to counter conservative gains.\\n\\nBiden has said he is against that — Ginsburg was, too — but he would face enormous pressure. Liberal activists say the court-packing already has been done, with Trump filling the seat that became open during Obama’s term and the president’s rush to nominate a replacement for Ginsburg even though voting in the presidential election has begun.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe unstable atmosphere might be reason for caution, at least initially.\\n\\n“While the chief justice has seemed particularly sensitive to institutional concerns, it is likely that the court as a whole would be sensitive to concerns about an abrupt shift in jurisprudence as it transitions from the current vacancy,” Garre said.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/09/09/white-house-senate-coronavirus-relief-economy/', 'Full Text': 'White House officials have discussed efforts to unilaterally provide support for the flagging airline industry while also bolstering unemployment benefits, according to two people aware of the deliberations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal policy discussions.

The moves have had mixed success and came as political talks faltered on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nSince then, the bipartisan urgency that propelled Congress to act with near-unanimity in March and April to approve an unprecedented $3 trillion in relief has eroded even further.

I hope that’s not the case,” the majority leader said when asked if he thought Congress would adjourn through the election without passing new coronavirus relief.\\n\\nThe only negotiations happening are on a stand-alone spending bill known as a continuing resolution, or CR, to keep the government from shutting down in October. The White House and Democrats have signaled a willingness to pass such a measure quickly before heading home to campaign for reelection, although they have yet to reach agreement on how long it should last.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMcConnell said Wednesday that he would like to see the stopgap spending bill last into December, but Schumer said no decisions had been made.\\n\\n“I think both parties want to get out of here and campaign,” Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard C.

Some White House officials believe the stock market’s recovery since late March means the economy has regained its footing. The labor market has recovered roughly half of the jobs lost in March and April, but millions of Americans remain unemployed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMany Democrats have said much more needs to be done to help the economy, while there is a significant bloc of Senate Republicans who have opposed spending any more money after the unprecedented stimulus in the spring. Pressure from this group forced McConnell to abandon a $1 trillion bill he introduced in July in favor of the legislation that will come to a vote Thursday, which costs about half as much.\\n\\nDemocrats have largely rejected the Senate GOP offering, saying instead that Republicans should negotiate from a $3.4 trillion bill that the House passed in May. That measure included some provisions that the White House supports, such as a new round of stimulus checks for households and small business aid. But the House Democrats’ bill also includes provisions that the White House says it will not accept, such as nearly $1 trillion for states and cities.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDespite polling showing keen public interest in the coronavirus, strategists on both sides say Congress’s inaction has barely broken through in contested House or Senate races.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Some of the Republicans in the Senate need to be listening and need to feel the pressure from their communities,” said Rep.

Virginia was also mentioned in one of Trump’s “liberate” tweets — with the added context that, in his view, the state’s leadership was hoping to end gun rights.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOver the course of the past several months, Trump has repeatedly cast continued efforts to contain the pandemic as politically motivated efforts to suppress the economy and, therefore, his reelection chances. Last month, he retweeted a description of news that a judge had ruled against Pennsylvania’s shutdown that claimed, “TYRANTS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL.”\\n\\nThis is an obviously problematic mixture, blending calls for “liberation” with criticisms of “tyranny” and the need to defend gun ownership. That came to a head when armed protesters stormed the state capitol building in Michigan, calling for an end to shutdowns.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“The Governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire,” Trump tweeted on May 1. “These are very good people,” he said of the protesters, “but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely!”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Thursday, the FBI announced it had charged six men who it said were part of an alleged plot to kidnap Whitmer. The criminal complaint detailing the government’s evidence depicts a serious effort to obtain weapons and explosives, to train for their use, to surveil Whitmer’s vacation home in Michigan and even to disable a bridge with the goal of preventing law enforcement from assisting Whitmer during an attack.\\n\\nWhat had Whitmer done to deserve this? She was a “tyrant.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn a video posted to a private Facebook group — apparently one of the main tools used in organizing the alleged plot — one of the indicted individuals allegedly disparaged Whitmer using that term, according to the criminal complaint. At another point, the complaint asserts, the same man allegedly told his compatriots that Whitmer “loves the power she has right now” and that she “has no checks and balances at all. She has uncontrolled power right now.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I can see several states takin’ their [expletive] tyrants,” he purportedly added. “Everybody takes their tyrants.”\\n\\nAt another point, he allegedly insisted that they weren’t “gonna let ‘em burn our [expletive] state down.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt doesn’t seem that the rhetoric motivating the alleged threat against Whitmer derived from Trump. The group first came to law enforcement’s attention in March when allegedly targeting police; it apparently wasn’t until June that the focus on Whitmer emerged.\\n\\nInstead, it seems clear that Trump understands the political utility of using similar language, of portraying himself as standing with those who see the government as a threat, however improbable that might be, given his own position. He knows that armed individuals who are skeptical of the government and who oppose coronavirus restrictions are people who are likely to vote for him, so he echoes and amplifies them.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn an April YouGov poll, 6 in 10 Michiganders rejected the idea that a lockdown was unconstitutional. More than half of Republicans, though, said it was. Nationally, Republicans were more likely than Democrats or independents to say lockdowns were unconstitutional, but were more evenly split on the subject.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump clearly lets politics drive how he perceives threats. He regularly derides antifa, a loose-knit, leftist ideology, as a significant threat to the country while downplaying the risks posed by groups sympathetic to his positions — though they may pose a bigger risk. We’ve seen multiple instances in which Trump plays footsie with sketchy elements of his base out of apparent concern with alienating them. Asked about adherents of the wildly bizarre QAnon conspiracy theory in August, for example, Trump coyly described the group as one that liked him very much, which he said he appreciated. Asked at the first presidential debate if he would condemn white supremacists, Trump declined to do so explicitly. Instead, he told one prominent group to “stand back and stand by.”\\n\\nTrump gives those dangerous groups oxygen. The FBI announced last year that QAnon was one of a number of fringe groups whose adherents might commit acts of violence. This month, the Department of Homeland Security released a report identifying violent white supremacists as a primary threat to the country.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCalling for the “liberation” of Democratic states and approving of armed protests targeting his opponents might be politically useful for Trump, but the risks should be obvious. We’ve seen several examples in which violent acts have been committed by people echoing Trump’s rhetoric, if not directly.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBefore a mass shooting in El Paso last year, the alleged shooter is thought to have published a document mirroring Trump’s language about immigrants.\\n\\nMore recently, a 17-year-old is accused of killing two people in Kenosha, Wis., at a protest following a police shooting in the city. Trump had repeatedly argued that violence at protests centered on racial justice posed a threat to the country. Kyle Rittenhouse allegedly took his rifle and traveled across state lines to serve as a citizen peacekeeper, with tragic results. Trump later defended the teen’s actions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe alleged plot to target Whitmer was also cognizant of the political calendar.\\n\\n“On September 14, 2020,” the criminal complaint reads, one participant “posted in the group’s encrypted chat that he did not want the exercise to be the last week in October because it would leave insufficient time to execute the kidnapping before the national election on November 3, 2020.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLuckily, federal law enforcement was able to track and disrupt this alleged plot. Trump’s disinterest in rejecting extremists and his explicit mirroring of their rhetoric, though, doesn’t diminish the likelihood that other such plots exist.\\n\\nUpdate: On Thursday evening, Trump addressed the alleged plot in a series of tweets. They began by attacking Whitmer and never criticized the alleged plotters.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/16/2020-summer-black-culture-pushed-back/', 'Full Text': 'For Black Americans, 2020 has been defined by agonizing reminders that the past isn’t really past. Yet something hopeful happened over the past several months, too. This summer, Black culture pushed back. On stages large and small, Black artists boldly offered up galvanizing visions that suggest not only canAmericans of all races disentangle ourselves from a racist past, but also we can build a better future together.\\n\\nSome of these works emerged from the ground up. In Richmond, activists and artists transformed a monument to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee into a graffiti wall, a screen displaying the ghostly visage of George Floyd, and a stage for Black ballerinas Kennedy George and Ava Holloway. Black Irish step dancer Morgan Bullock went viral with TikTok videos of traditional choreography set to hip-hop.\\n\\nPainting, sculpture and ballet are fine arts, which is a polite way of saying they’ve been dominated by White artists and patrons. Turning a formal monument to the Lost Cause into an illustration of the cost of racism doesn’t just make the point that Floyd is dead when he shouldn’t be. Putting the delicacy of ballet or the precision of Irish step dancing to work in service of Black power and Black playfulness doesn’t merely send the message that Black girls can dance, too. Works such as these free up our imagination and ambition. If Monument Avenue can become a venue for Black creativity rather than white supremacy, and if dance can be a tool of militancy, what else about the world could be different as well?\\n\\nThis ambition showed up not just in work by outsider, lesser-known artists but in new releases from more traditional sources, from Beyoncé Knowles-Carter’s “Black Is King” to Christopher Nolan’s “Tenet.”\\n\\n“Black Is King” is striking not merely for telling a fantastical story about a Black royal family but also for where and how it was released. The film premiered on Disney Plus and on cable channels in African and Middle Eastern countries in special deals negotiated by Disney at Knowles-Carter’s behest. With “Black Is King,” Knowles-Carter used her power as an artist to depict the African diaspora, and as a businesswoman to convene a virtual gathering of its members.\\n\\n“Black Is King” is a retelling of Disney’s “The Lion King.” But Disney is a company that in its early years routinely trafficked in vicious racial stereotypes. Rather than reckon with or contextualize the movies that helped build the Mouse House, the company has buried the most notorious one, “Song of the South,” in service of a brand that aims to be as blandly appealing to as many people as possible.\\n\\nBy contrast, “Black Is King” is not intended to be universal; it’s specific to Knowles-Carter’s experience as a Black mother raising a Black son, to whom the album is dedicated, and Black girls. Still, the movie doesn’t feel exclusionary. It simply asks White audiences to make the same mental adjustment Hollywood has long expected from audiences of color — to accept that while they won’t see themselves in every detail of the lyrics and visuals, they can be stirred just the same. For Disney to acknowledge that Black artists can speak specifically, and that White audiences are willing to absorb themselves in a Black artist’s perspective, is a step in the direction of a company that’s not merely more progressive but that also makes more interesting work.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the African syndication deals for “Black Is King” enabled a debate that wasn’t solely defined by Black Americans but was expanded to include Nigerian students who felt stereotyped by the movie’s use of animal skins and prints, or Kenyan immigrants to the United States frustrated that the movie paid little attention to East African countries.\\n\\nWhile “Black Is King” debuted on small screens, the movie industry hoped to lure audiences back to big ones with the release of “Tenet,” starring John David Washington as a nameless special operative chasing messages sent back in time from the future. Washington, as a second-generation Black leading man (his father is Denzel Washington), is a rarity because the entertainment industry has wasted so many opportunities to elevate Black superstars in previous generations.\\n\\n“Tenet” is not squarely about race. Yet there’s something striking about watching Washington’s character with his White male sidekicks. Washington isn’t decor in “Tenet”; the movie relies on the idea that he has the potential to be a massive star. The men who are helping make him one include Robert Pattinson, a former teen heartthrob, and Michael Caine, who memorably played butler to Christian Bale’s Batman, the superheroic epitome of White elitism.\\n\\n“Tenet” reaches its climax when Washington’s character declares himself the protagonist of the story and claims a special ability to grapple with the past and influence the future. This dialogue might have felt like time-travel movie boilerplate in the mouth of a White actor. As spoken by Washington, against the current backdrop of political upheaval, his character’s assertion of control feels radical and exciting.\\n\\nTaken together, these works give the summer of 2020 an Afrofuturist cast. That movement imagines what might come of the relationship between technology and various offshoots of the African diaspora, be it Parliament Funkadelic’s spacefaring Cadillacs or novelist Octavia Butler’s dream of extreme empathy as an interplanetary superpower.\\n\\n“Tenet” gives us a Black master of multiple timelines, “Black Is King” a vision of a Black aristocracy. Both refuse to allow racism to constrain the scope of the future they imagine for Black characters. And the way smaller, grass-roots artworks went viral serves as a reminder that we are already living in the future. Even 15 years ago, who could have dreamed that teenage dancers would use pocket-size computers to broadcast themselves to the world?\\n\\nIf this was a summer of surprising hopefulness, the death of actor Chadwick Boseman inflicted a particularly cruel blow. The roles that made him a star — groundbreakers such as Jackie Robinson, James Brown, Thurgood Marshall and the superhero T’Challa — positioned him as a bridge between Black history and a future of Black liberation.\\n\\n“Black Panther” was the ultimate mainstream Afrofuturist movie, a romp through a fictional African country that has used technology to spare itself the scourges of racism. As the titular character, Boseman played a king trying to guide his nation about whether to stay hidden or to reveal its discoveries.\\n\\nBoseman’s characters in his biopics were trying to share their talents with a racist world that didn’t want to recognize their abilities. In “Black Panther,” he got to play a figure who represented what Black people might have been able to do if they were free to follow their gifts.\\n\\nBoseman will not be the last Black artist to take off running from the past to carry us into a vision of the future. In 2013, the novelist N.K. Jemisin published an essay titled “How Long ‘Til Black Future Month?” She has her answer, and so do we: The time is now. The question is what all of us, Black and otherwise, do with it.\\n\\nRead more:\\n\\nKaren Attiah: ‘Black Is King’ is built on problematic narratives.

Gore 20 years ago.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAppropriately enough, the court begins its work Monday with a case about political appointments to the high court — of Delaware.\\n\\nThat state’s history of requiring that its top court be roughly balanced between Democrats and Republicans has won plaudits from business interests and others. But it is being challenged by a lawyer who says that, as a political independent, he and others who do not want to affiliate with the major political parties are denied an opportunity to serve.\\n\\nThe politics of the U.S. Supreme Court are unsettled by the Sept. 18 death of its second-longest serving member, the 87-year-old Ginsburg. Her absence leaves the court with three liberals chosen by Democratic presidents and five conservatives picked by Republicans.\\n\\nIt will be six conservatives, if the Republican-led Senate uses its slim majority to confirm Barrett by the end of October. But those plans are also uncertain, following the news that the president had been hospitalized after contracting the coronavirus and some GOP senators had tested positive for it after last weekend’s Rose Garden ceremony announcing Barrett’s nomination.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe 48-year-old judge and law professor from the University of Notre Dame is the ideological opposite of the woman she would replace. Her confirmation to the lifetime appointment would move the ideological center of the court to the right and could cost Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. the pivotal role he played last term. He alone was in the majority for almost all of the court’s major decisions, whether the outcome cheered conservatives or liberals.\\n\\nBut it could also be that, for the short term, the court takes on a less ambitious agenda. The court with a new member tends to tread cautiously at first, although eventually Barrett would almost ensure a majority that looks more skeptically at abortion rights, gun control, affirmative action and the power of government agencies.\\n\\nThose issues are largely missing from the court’s docket at this point, though it continues adding cases through January.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf the White House timeline for confirming Barrett holds, she would be in place for what are now the biggest controversies on the court’s docket.\\n\\nThe week after the election, the court hears its third challenge to the legal merits of the Affordable Care Act, the signature domestic accomplishment of President Barack Obama.\\n\\nThe justices will review a federal appeals court decision that found part of the law, also known as Obamacare, unconstitutional. While the court did not pass judgment on whether that doomed the entire law, a coalition of Republican-led states, supported by the Trump administration, is making that argument at the Supreme Court.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSince the Trump administration is not defending the law, a coalition of Democratic-led states and the House of Representatives are on the other side in the case, California v. Texas.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe challenge, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, arose from a decision in 2017 by Congress to reduce the penalty for a person not buying health insurance — the so-called individual mandate — to zero. But lacking the votes to bury Obamacare, Congress left the rest of the law intact.\\n\\nPaxton argues that Congress has removed the essential tax element that Roberts cited in finding the law constitutional in 2012, when he joined with the court’s four liberals to save the program. A district judge in Texas agreed, as did two of three judges on a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the dissenting judge said the question of whether the individual mandate is constitutional is “purely academic.” What matters, said Judge Carolyn Dineen King, is the decision by the 2017 Congress that “left the rest of the Affordable Care Act in place.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGinsburg was part of the majority in both previous challenges to the ACA, and Barrett has written critically about the legal underpinnings of Obamacare and Roberts’s decisions upholding it.\\n\\nBut even lawyers who have been supportive of past challenges say this one seems a long shot.\\n\\nJustices across the ideological divide have said that when the court finds an unconstitutional element in the law, it must look carefully at whether the rest of it can be severed and remain in place.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe court found that was the case twice last term, with Roberts writing one such opinion and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, one of Trump’s two appointees, writing another.\\n\\n“Constitutional litigation is not a game of gotcha against Congress, where litigants can ride a discrete constitutional flaw in a statute to take down the whole, otherwise constitutional statute,” Kavanaugh wrote.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPaul D. Clement, who was a solicitor general for President George W. Bush and who made the case against Obamacare at the Supreme Court in 2012, said, “It’s a very different case this time around.”\\n\\nOn Nov. 4, when the rest of the country may still be counting the presidential vote, the court returns to unfinished business: what to do when anti-discrimination laws conflict with religious rights.\\n\\nThe justices will take up a legal fight from Philadelphia, where city officials ended a contract to provide foster care services with Catholic Social Services because the agency said it would not accept applications from same-sex couples.\\n\\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit ruled the city was within its rights to end the contract and was not targeting the Catholic agency for its religious views. Instead, the court said, the city was insisting that those with whom it does business agree with its nondiscrimination policy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCatholic Social Services, which has provided foster care services for decades, said the city’s decision forces it either to violate religious views about marriage or forgo providing the kind of services essential to its mission. It notes the city contracts with other agencies who are happy to work with same-sex couples.\\n\\nThe agency is represented by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which is asking the court to reconsider an important 1990 decision written by Justice Antonin Scalia.\\n\\nThe ruling in Employment Division v. Smith said there was no special protection from laws that apply equally to everyone. “We have never held that an individual’s religious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the state is free to regulate,” Scalia wrote.\\n\\nBut the decision has become unpopular, and the court’s most conservative members have said they are open to reviewing it.\\n\\nThe case, Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, raises questions that the court largely sidestepped in 2018, when it found other reasons to rule for a Colorado baker who refused to discuss making a wedding cake for a gay couple, even though a state law prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation.\\n\\nLegal experts said there might be similar off-ramps in the Philadelphia case, if justices are not yet ready to declare a winner in such a contentious area of the law.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ginsburg-trump-biden-campaign/2020/09/18/f3658f64-fa12-11ea-be57-d00bb9bc632d_story.html', 'Full Text': 'Democratic and Republican leaders assembled for all-out political war. Despite Ginsburg’s dying wish that her successor not be determined until after the election, White House officials said President Trump is preparing to nominate a replacement in the coming days. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said that nominee would receive a vote in the Republican-\\n\\ncontrolled Senate — a departure from McConnell’s refusal to consider a nominee chosen by President Barack Obama before the 2016 election.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“President Trump’s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate,” McConnell said in a statement.\\n\\nDemocratic presidential nominee Joe Biden warned the Senate not to hold an election-year confirmation vote to fill Ginsburg’s seat.\\n\\n“Tonight and in the coming days we should focus on the loss of the justice and her enduring legacy. But there is no doubt — let me be clear — that the voters should pick the president and the president should pick the justice for the Senate to consider,” he told reporters in a hastily arranged appearance late Friday.\\n\\nPreviewing the path ahead, Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala D. Harris said in a statement Friday: “Tonight we mourn, we honor, and we pray for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her family. Tomorrow we fight for her legacy.”\\n\\nThe rare opportunity to replace a liberal stalwart and feminist icon with a conservative and cement the court’s shift to the right is likely to motivate Republicans more than any other issue and help further unite the right behind Trump and the party’s vulnerable Senate candidates, according to GOP strategists.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGinsburg’s death promises to be a catalyst for Democrats, too, who are poised to mobilize to elect Biden as president and replace the late justice with a liberal who would protect a generation of social measures — from same-sex marriage to the Affordable Care Act to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for undocumented immigrants known as “dreamers.”\\n\\n“The polarization in the country was already a 12 on a 1-to-10 scale. It was already off the charts. This is going to push it up to 15,” said Neil Newhouse, a longtime Republican pollster. “This energizes both liberals and conservatives, it ratchets up the intensity, and it puts a focus on what’s at stake in this election.”\\n\\nDavid Axelrod, who served as top political strategist to Obama, concurred.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“This is another log in an already roaring fire,” Axelrod said. “This is going to further intensify feelings on both sides. For Trump, there has been some softening among evangelicals in some of the polling. He may see this as a way to fire them up again.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBy 10 p.m., names of potential nominees began floating inside the top ranks of the GOP, with two particular names being mentioned in the early going — Judge Allison Jones Rushing and Judge Amy Coney Barrett — according to four Republicans close to the process who were not authorized to speak publicly. But the Republicans noted that talks were fluid and that Trump ultimately would come up with his own shortlist.\\n\\nWhite House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows has been preparing for a vacancy for months, the Republicans said, and will be central in the coming weeks since he sees himself as a conduit to right-wing leaders on this front, such as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who has made the court and abortion a policy focus, and Leonard Leo, a conservative lawyer who has worked closely with the White House on past high court nominations.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump has long considered judicial appointments as the glue between him and his evangelical base. In the 2016 campaign, he released a list of possible Supreme Court picks as a way to prove his allegiance to social conservatives. And since taking office, he has nominated a record number of judges to the federal courts, including two Supreme Court justices, Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEarlier this month, Trump updated his list of Supreme Court contenders as a way to motivate evangelicals in the run-up to the election.\\n\\nRallying supporters Friday night in Bemidji, Minn. — where he delivered a lengthy and largely off-the-cuff speech without apparent knowledge of Ginsburg’s death — Trump brought up judicial appointments.\\n\\n“The Supreme Court is so important,” Trump said. “The next president will get one, two, three, or four,” he added. “I had two.”\\n\\nAfter leaving the stage, Trump learned of the justice’s death, and told reporters: “She just died? Wow. I didn’t know that.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer,” a Trump rally staple, played in the background, the president added, “You’re telling me now for the first time. She led an amazing life. What else can you say? She was an amazing woman, whether you agreed or not, she was an amazing woman who led an amazing life. I’m actually sad to hear that. I’m sad to hear that. Thank you very much.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome in Trump’s political orbit were notably enthusiastic about the potential impact of Ginsburg’s death on the contours of the campaign. One former White House official, reflecting an emerging consensus in Trump world, said, “This is certainly a catalyzing event that needed to happen in this moment.”\\n\\nThis official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the politics of the moment so soon after Ginsburg’s passing, added, “This is an animating issue for the entire right. It unifies everybody from Mitt Romney to the most hardcore MAGA Trump person out there at a time when Trump needed that. It will give something to fight for over the next 45 days or so that could potentially remind people, ‘Okay, this is why I voted for Trump, and this is why even if he makes me crazy sometimes, I’ve got to stick with him.’ ”\\n\\nFor Trump — who polls show has been trailing Biden nationally and in many battleground states for months now, in part because of overwhelming disapproval of his management of the pandemic — the Supreme Court vacancy offers the opportunity to reframe the race away from the coronavirus.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It helps Trump and it helps Republican Senate candidates,” said Dan Eberhart, a Republican donor and fundraiser. “We are not running solely on the covid response and the economy anymore. This resets the race.”\\n\\nThe court vacancy has implications for Senate candidates as well, most especially a handful of Republican incumbents in danger of losing their seats. In a message to Republican senators Friday night, McConnell urged his colleagues to “keep your powder dry” and to refrain from commenting definitively on whether they would agree to vote on a Trump nominee now or wait until after the election.\\n\\n“Over the coming days, we are all going to come under tremendous pressure from the press to announce how we will handle the coming nomination,” McConnell said. “For those of you who are unsure how to answer, or for those inclined to oppose giving a nominee a vote, I urge you all to keep your powder dry. This is not the time to prematurely lock yourselves into a position you may later regret.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nObama weighed in just before midnight with a statement imploring the Senate to adhere to the standard McConnell set in 2016.\\n\\n“A basic principle of the law – and of everyday fairness – is that we apply rules with consistency, and not based on what’s convenient or advantageous in the moment,” Obama said. “The rule of law, the legitimacy of our courts, the fundamental workings of our democracy all depend on that basic principle. As votes are already being cast in this election, Republican Senators are now called to apply that standard.”\\n\\nNeera Tanden, the president of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, predicted that any Republican efforts to jam through a Trump nominee before the election would hurt Republican candidates with voters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Independents will find this disgusting,” Tanden said. “People are voting today. The American people will recoil in disgust.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a Biden supporter and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, also warned that Republicans would pay a price at the ballot box.\\n\\n“It will be an ultimate insult to the rule of law and an offense to our constitutional principles to make the court a political football,” Blumenthal said in an interview. “The American people will judge any Republican who votes to fill it before the election in this politically driven, reckless and irresponsible way.”\\n\\nDemocratic strategists said the vacancy could have an especially profound impact on women voters, perhaps more so than Kavanaugh’s 2018 confirmation hearings, considering Ginsburg’s outsize legacy as a feminist pioneer.\\n\\n“We saw during the Kavanaugh hearings that it rallied suburban women, that they cared about the issues that were being debated, that they cared about the Supreme Court, and they came out and Democrats won” in the midterm elections, said Christina Reynolds, vice president for communications at Emily’s List. “This is going to be even bigger in the sense that we all know who Ruth Bader Ginsburg is. For young women, for older women, for all of us, she has inspired us and mobilized us and led in a way that I think a lot of Democratic and independent women feel.”\\n\\nOn the left, Ginsburg’s death was met with a swift outcry from liberal activists who demanded that Democrats rally behind the idea of expanding the Supreme Court, particularly if Republicans seek to fill her seat before the end of this Congress. During the Democratic presidential primaries, Biden came out squarely against the idea, known as “packing the court.”\\n\\nBut Ginsburg’s death could apply renewed pressure on Biden to embrace such calls, even as he seeks to cement his support from more-moderate voters, who have been cooler to the idea. If McConnell fills the vacancy this year, Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) wrote on Twitter, “when Democrats control the Senate in the next Congress, we must abolish the filibuster and expand the Supreme Court.”\\n\\nBiden has vowed to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court, but his campaign has repeatedly declined to provide a list of those under consideration.\\n\\n“One thing I hesitate to do is follow anything the president does at all, because he usually does it all wrong,” Biden said during a news conference on June 30. “We are putting together a list of a group of African American women who are qualified and have the experience to be in the court. I am not going to release that until we go further down the line in vetting them, as well.”\\n\\nVarious groups have expressed some frustration that Biden has not done more to motivate voters by using a list or talking more about the Supreme Court and the importance of filling vacancies — a topic that Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, should know well.\\n\\nAlexis McGill Johnson, the president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, urged the Biden campaign to do more to express the urgency of the fight, in a way that Republicans have often done more effectively — including by releasing a list of Biden’s potential Supreme Court nominees.\\n\\n“This is a crucial moment for the Biden campaign to step in and really make the case for how the Supreme Court in particular and the judiciary writ large is impacting our daily lives,” Johnson said in an interview.\\n\\nBiden also has expressed mixed views of when and how vacancies should be filled. During a Senate floor speech in June 1992, he argued that they should not be filled in the heat of a presidential campaign.\\n\\n“Once the political season is underway, and it is, action on a Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over,” Biden said at the time. “Otherwise, it seems to me, we will be in deep trouble as an institution.”\\n\\nAfter clips of the speech circulated in February 2016, when the Obama administration wanted to fill a vacancy when Justice Antonin Scalia died, Biden clarified his position and said the former speech was taken out of context.\\n\\n“Some critics say that one excerpt of my speech is evidence that I oppose filling a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year,” he said in a statement. “This is not an accurate description of my views on the subject.”\\n\\nInstead, Biden said, the Senate and the White House should overcome partisan differences to fill a vacancy. “That remains my position today,” he said.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/08/michigan-plot-kidnapping-boogaloo-socialmedia/', 'Full Text': 'Such online declarations, brimming with anger and potentially violent intent, have become staples of extremism-fueled crime news in recent years, from police killings to synagogue massacres to bombing plots. Before they become real, they percolate online, courtesy of a social media ecosystem that is ubiquitous, barely moderated and well suited to helping aggrieved people find each other.\\n\\nFox and other suspects in the plot to kidnap Whitmer (D) left a trail on social media that, viewed with the hindsight of Thursday’s announcement of their arrests, looks both troubling and troublingly familiar — a line of rage that flows from online memes to real-world violence that at times has become deadly.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere’s a YouTube video of one suspect, Brandon Caserta, pretending to fire a weapon while wearing a sleeveless shirt that used an obscenity to describe what he’d like to do to “THE GOVERNMENT.” Visible in the closet behind him are Hawaiian shirts — common symbols of the violently anti-government Boogaloo movement. In a TikTok video, Caserta is shown wearing such a shirt.\\n\\nThere’s the Twitter account that apparently belongs to another suspect, Barry Croft, ranting about immigrants, praising President Trump and calling for the prosecution of Trump’s onetime Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. One image featured by the account shows a young man draped in ammunition and cradling a rifle in his hands. Croft also appears to have an account on a small social media site devoted to spreading QAnon, the right-wing conspiracy theory.\\n\\nAnd then there was a Facebook page called “Michigan Militia Corps, Wolverines” that, until it was taken down in recent weeks, enlisted similar rhetoric as the group behind the plot, which authorities identified as “Wolverine Watchmen.” In a May post linking to an article headlined, “Trump sides with protesters against Michigan governor,” there is an accompanying image of men holding massive firearms.\\n\\n“Social media companies have been allowing these communities to build and grow, ignoring the mounting evidence that memes, posts and images encouraging violence can and do translate into actual violence,” said Cindy Otis, a former CIA analyst and vice president of analysis for the Alethea Group, which tracks online threats and discovered the Wolverines page. “Not only have many of these Michigan pages and groups been on Facebook for years, the Facebook algorithm actively recommended other militia-related groups and pages to join, allowing each page and group to expand their reach. ”\\n\\nFacebook in June removed hundreds of Boogaloo accounts and groups, including one for the Wolverine Watchmen, after growing signs that their violent online rhetoric was spilling into the real world. The company said in a statement Thursday: “We remove content, disable accounts and immediately report to law enforcement when there is a credible threat of imminent harm to people or public safety. We proactively reached out and cooperated with the FBI early in this ongoing investigation.\"\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThough it’s impossible to know exactly what role social media plays in developing criminal intent, incidents of violent extremism increasingly are accompanied by substantial evidence of online activity that, after arrests, is laid out in court documents and cobbled together by independent researchers.\\n\\nWhen a security guard was gunned down in May outside the federal courthouse in Oakland, Calif., investigators quickly linked his accused killer, Air Force Sgt. Steven Carrillo, to the Boogaloo movement, which spread extensively on Facebook and other social media before sites cracked down on them.\\n\\nCarrillo, according to court documents, posted about his desire to inflame protests happening near the Oakland courthouse ahead of his ambush of the security guard. “Use their anger to fuel our fire. Think outside the box. We have mobs of angry people to use to our advantage.” He scrawled the word “Boog” in blood on a car he had stolen in a separate incident that resulted in the killing of a sheriff’s deputy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn June, federal officials charged three men affiliated with Boogaloo of planning to use molotov cocktails and other explosives to trigger a violent reaction among protesters gathered in Las Vegas. They were part of a Nevada Boogaloo group on Facebook, documents said.\\n\\nIn the 15-page FBI affidavit about the Michigan plot released Thursday, there are three references to a private Facebook group and 11 to encrypted communication apps. Independent researchers soon found the arrested men active on Twitter, TikTok, Facebook and YouTube.\\n\\nA second criminal affidavit, filed by the Michigan State Police, said that one of the arrested men, Joseph Morrison, was the commander of Wolverine Watchman. But he had another name he used online, Boogaloo Bunyan, in yet another reference to the violent anti-government movement that gained prominence during the anti-government protests that erupted in many state capitals and other cities in the spring.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAlthough much online extremism comes with at least a dash of irony or humor, sometimes delivered in visual memes, it can have the effect of gradually introducing radical ideas to people newly encountering them online.\\n\\n“After you’re exposed to ironic violence for an extended period of time, the irony fades away. Then it’s just violence,” said Alex Goldenberg, lead intelligence analyst for the Network Contagion Research Institute, which studies online extremism and has warned about the dangers posed by the Boogaloo.\\n\\nSITE Intelligence Group, meanwhile, found threats to Whitmer and government officials generally on fringe social media sites, such as 8kun. One user lamented that the governor wasn’t killed when protesters entered the Capitol in Lansing in April to protest pandemic-related restrictions on individuals and businesses.\\n\\n“You can’t seize power unless you kill those who had power,” the anonymous user said. “They did not. ”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSITE Executive Director Rita Katz said, “In recent months at SITE, we’ve watched different corners of the far right and militia groups flooding the same predictions of civil war, military coups, and chaos. It’s a startling consensus among them that violence against the \\'other’ is inevitable. ”\\n\\nThe Facebook page affiliated with the Wolverines group had around 3,000 likes and was active until at least the end of August, according to the Alethea Group’s Otis.\\n\\nAn examination by Alethea Group and the Global Disinformation Index, which also tracks online threats, suggests social media has been instrumental in the escalating actions by Michigan militias, first over pandemic-related restrictions imposed by Whitmer and now in the run-up to the November election, despite recent efforts by Facebook and other platforms to curtail violent activity.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe groups, while now mostly knocked off Facebook, used the platform for years to build their membership, exchange information, host events and coordinate training. In the spring, they proved themselves capable of disrupting democracy, fomenting armed standoffs at the Capitol that caused the state to cancel a legislative session.\\n\\nThe Wolverines page advertised meet-and-greets and pro-gun marches. It was also littered with anti-Whitmer content, including a headline calling her “America’s most incompetent politician,” according to a cached version of the page.\\n\\nAlethea Group and the Global Disinformation Index identified 25 militia groups in Michigan, including several that operate well-organized bureaucracies with leadership hierarchies, local chapters, and fitness and training activities.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhile some of the groups have recently been banned from Facebook, their members say they quickly have been able to restore their personal accounts and have little difficulty communicating through other channels, including the social networking app MeWe.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe main obstacle for Phil Robinson, a co-founder of the Michigan Liberty Militia who appeared during the spring’s events in Lansing with green tactical gloves and a matching long gun, was that he lost photos he had posted of the group. “We’re always ready to respond,” he said, while adding that preparing for winter was a more immediate concern than the election.\\n\\nAt least two members of the Liberty Militia were arrested as part of Wednesday’s sweep, according to Michael Lackomar, a communications officer and team leader for the Southeast Michigan Volunteer Militia. Robinson did not respond to a request for comment Thursday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOne of the suspects who faces federal charges, Caserta, appeared to have a TikTok account under the username kinetictruth.\\n\\nIn a recent video, he is shown wearing a Hawaiian shirt, which has become a marker of the Boogaloo movement. In another, he warns that the “price of freedom is eternal vigilance,” according to a recording from the Detroit News. But after the charges were filed, his videos were removed and his account was banned from the app. TikTok confirmed it removed the account in line with its policies “to reduce potential glorification of harm or martyrdom,” representative Hilary McQuaide said.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/29/what-we-know-about-efforts-by-trumps-2016-campaign-suppress-black-votes/', 'Full Text': 'The particularly intriguing part of what Channel 4 found isn’t that latter information, which has been vastly exaggerated in both its contents and its role in 2016. Instead, the most interesting revelation is that the Trump campaign moved voters into five groups: certain Trump and Hillary Clinton voters, persuadable voters who hadn’t chosen a side, Trump voters who would need to be encouraged to vote — and Clinton voters who should be “deterred” from voting.\\n\\nThat latter group had one defining characteristic: It was mostly non-White.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“In total, more than three-and-a-half million Black voters were marked ‘deterrence,’ ” reporter Krishnan Guru-Murthy said in the Channel 4 report. “If you include other ethnic minorities, they made up 54 percent of the deterrent segment.”\\n\\nAt another point, Guru-Murthy said: “Now, we can reveal for the first time that many [Black voters] had been identified by the Trump campaign and its supporters. Their aim? Not to win their votes, it seems, but to get them to stay at home on Election Day.”\\n\\nThis assertion is, in fact, not bolstered by the rest of the report.\\n\\nIt’s not a new revelation that the Trump campaign was hoping to tamp down Black turnout in 2016. Shortly before the election, reporters from Bloomberg News visited the Trump campaign war room, where they were explicitly told that the campaign wanted to limit the number of Black people who turned out that year.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“We have three major voter suppression operations under way,” an official with the campaign told Bloomberg’s Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg. Among the targets were Black voters.\\n\\nThe team was even told specifically how that would work.\\n\\nOn Oct. 24, Trump’s team began placing spots on select African American radio stations. In San Antonio, a young staffer showed off a South Park-style animation he’d created of Clinton delivering the “super predator” line (using audio from her original 1996 sound bite), as cartoon text popped up around her: “Hillary Thinks African Americans are Super Predators.” The animation will be delivered to certain African American voters through Facebook “dark posts” — nonpublic posts whose viewership the campaign controls so that, as [then-digital director Brad] Parscale puts it, “only the people we want to see it, see it.” The aim is to depress Clinton’s vote total. “We know because we’ve modeled this,” says the official. “It will dramatically affect her ability to turn these people out.”\\n\\nIn fact, Black turnout was down in 2016. An analysis of the Census Bureau’s voter turnout data determined that Black turnout was down from 67 percent to about 60 percent between 2012 and 2016, with the density of Black voters declining from 13 to 12 percent. Another review of voter information found that 4.4 million people who had supported Barack Obama in 2012 did not vote in 2016. More than half of that group was non-White and a third Black.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut it’s not necessarily the case that the Trump campaign’s alleged effort to depress Black turnout was why turnout was depressed. Before the election (and the alleged effort detailed above) there were already reports that enthusiasm for Clinton was down among Black voters, relative to Obama. There’s at least one obvious reason that might be the case: Obama was the nation’s first Black president. In 2004, Black turnout was at 61 percent, jumping to 69 percent in 2008 when Obama was first on the ballot. The 60 percent in 2016 was essentially back to pre-Obama levels.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNonetheless, Trump repeatedly celebrated that decrease in turnout.\\n\\n“Remember the famous line, because I talk about crime, I talk about lack of education, I talk about no jobs. And I’d say, what the hell do you have to lose? Right?” Trump said of his pitch to Black voters at a rally in December 2016. “It’s true. And they’re smart and they picked up on it like you wouldn’t believe. And you know what else? They didn’t come out to vote for Hillary. They didn’t come out. And that was a big — so thank you to the African American community.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump’s campaign wanted Black people to stay home. Black people stayed home. Trump was happy.\\n\\nThe Channel 4 report never establishes anything more than that the campaign flagged a disproportionate number of Black people as “deterrence” targets. It alludes vaguely to ads targeting those communities (something, again, detailed by Bloomberg News in 2016) but never explains what scale those ads might have reached. You or I could make an ad trying to persuade people to buy something, but if we show it to only 100 people, it’s tricky to take credit for thousands of sales.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nInstead, it uses the “deterrence” categorization to build a gauzy allegation of deviousness.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBlack voters in Wisconsin, Guru-Murthy says at one point, “made up just 5.4 percent of voters but 17 percent of the deterrence group. More than a third of Black voters were classified as deterrence. Contrast that with the voters the Trump campaign thought it could win over: 75 percent of them were White, but less than 2 percent were Black.”\\n\\nYou don’t need to be an expert on U.S. politics to understand one likely reason that Black voters would largely be categorized by a Republican presidential candidate as voters they would rather see not turn out: Black voters are much more likely to identify as Democrats than Republicans.\\n\\nCampaigns often use broad demographic categories to identify voters to target or ignore. If you’re a campaign that needs to turn out infrequent voters but don’t have specific polling or voter contact info allowing you to specifically target only your supporters, it might be worth it simply to turn out a demographic group that polling shows backs your candidate heavily. Say you’re winning 80 percent of the vote among those 40 and younger. It’s worth it to simply turn out every voter younger than 40, because for every voter you get to the polls who votes for your opponent, four will vote for you. That’s worth it — just as it would be worth it for your opponent to hope those voters stayed home.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn Wisconsin, there are currently about 4.5 million people registered, according to data from L2, a political data firm, about 4.4 percent of them Black. About 1.4 million of those 4.5 million are probably Democrats and 1.4 million probably Republicans. (The state doesn’t have partisan registration.) Of the likely Democrats, 14 percent are Black. Of the likely Republicans, less than 0.2 percent are. If you’re trying to “deter” voters from casting a ballot based on their likelihood to support Hillary Clinton, the odds are good that the pool of voters you’re targeting is going to be more heavily Black than the voting population overall.\\n\\nIt’s quite fair to object to the idea that Black voters — or any voters — should be targeted in an effort to suppress their turnout. But there’s no indication that anything particularly exceptional happened four years ago. The Trump campaign certainly thought its effort clever enough to boast about it to Bloomberg’s reporters, but its use of negative ads to suppress enthusiasm for Clinton is absolutely a standard tool of any political campaign. (It’s also a tool that may not work particularly well, regardless.)\\n\\nOne of the effects of Trump’s surprising win in 2016 has been to elevate its tactics as unusually savvy or innovative. In reality, the campaign poured massive amounts of money into Facebook, largely to boost fundraising, as its candidate leveraged rhetoric that past Republicans shied away from about immigrants and terrorism. Black turnout fell from 2012, but it is probably smarter to attribute that to the change in the Democratic ticket, more than radio ads run by Trump’s campaign.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt one point in the Channel 4 report, Guru-Murthy shows a Black voter who was on the “deterrence” list a negative ad from the Trump campaign targeting Clinton.\\n\\n“Isn’t it possible that some of that advertising influenced you at the time?” Guru-Murthy asks the voter.\\n\\n“It’s possible that it influenced somebody, but it doesn’t influence me,” the voter said. “I’m 100 percent sure.”\\n\\n“We can’t know what effect these ads had on each voter that saw them,” Guru-Murthy says in a subsequent voice-over. “But for the first time in 20 years, Black turnout fell.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-supreme-court-trump-ginsburg/2020/09/20/16f9e9e0-fb4c-11ea-b555-4d71a9254f4b_story.html', 'Full Text': \"Seeking to present himself as a president who would defuse the political and cultural battles engulfing the nomination process, Biden said that if he wins the November election he should be the one to fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whom Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have vowed to quickly replace.\\n\\nSpeaking in Philadelphia, Biden issued an extraordinary appeal to his former Senate colleagues, pleading with moderate Republicans to oppose Trump and McConnell and saying the vacancy presents those senators with a moral test.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“We need to de-escalate, not escalate,” Biden said. “So I appeal to those few Senate Republicans, the handful who really will decide what happens: Please, follow your conscience. Don’t vote to confirm anyone nominated under the circumstances President Trump and Senator McConnell have created. Don’t go there.”\\n\\nBiden’s remarks contrasted sharply with the reaction of many Democratic activists who are enraged that McConnell is pushing an election-year appointment after blocking President Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland four years ago. Proposals like adding more justices to the Supreme Court, long considered fringe, are gaining more acceptance in the party’s mainstream, as many Democrats say Republicans are no longer playing by long-accepted rules.\\n\\nRather than weighing in on such ideas, Biden stressed less-polarizing issues — noting that a new conservative justice could threaten the Affordable Care Act, which currently faces a challenge before the Supreme Court, and strip away health-care protections during a pandemic. It was part of a synchronized message on the court and the ACA with top Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill. A Biden aide said both sides were in touch and would be coordinating regularly.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhile Trump has released a list of potential appointees to the court, Biden said Sunday he would not do so, suggesting it would inflame tensions and subject the prospects to political attacks. He reiterated his commitment to nominating an African American woman, and said that both Republican and Democratic senators would have input on his selection.\\n\\nSupreme Court confirmation battles have been among the most explosive political events of recent years, culminating in the angry 2018 fight over now-Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. The prospect of another such battle threatened to further roil the already bitter presidential campaign at a time when Biden is seeking to project the aura of a different kind of leader. With Sunday’s comments, he turned the Supreme Court vacancy into an early test of his philosophy that Democrats should reach out to receptive Republicans rather than match the GOP’s belligerence with their own — an approach that is rejected by many in the party’s liberal wing.\\n\\nDuring his speech at the National Constitution Center, the former vice president stressed repeatedly that voting had already begun, saying that would make the rush to confirm a new justice an affront to democracy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe offered a simple proposition: If Trump wins, the Senate ought to consider his pick. But if Biden wins, Trump needs to withdraw his nominee.\\n\\nThis is not the first time Biden has faced calls from the resurgent left of the Democratic Party to adopt a far-reaching position — from “Medicare-for-all” to “Defund the police.” Each time, he has quickly disavowed those positions, while promising to take strong action of his own.\\n\\nOn Sunday, he noted pointedly that Senate Republicans have not yet confirmed a nominee, and made it clear that he was focused on preventing them from doing so, rather than contemplating the consequences if they did. “I’m not going to assume failure at this point,” Biden said. “I believe the voices of the American people should be heard and will be heard.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHis comments were notable for urging Republicans to disregard the position of their party leaders, Trump and McConnell. “The last thing we need is to add a constitutional crisis that plunges us deeper into the abyss, deeper into the darkness,” he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome on Biden’s team have been aggravated by the calls on the left to expand the court, expressing particular annoyance with Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) for urging Democrats to abolish the filibuster and add more justices if Senate Republicans move to fill the vacancy.\\n\\n“People in your own party shouldn’t cause you problems 44 days out,” said one adviser, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe notion of “court packing” has suffered from a bad reputation since President Franklin D. Roosevelt tried and failed in 1937 to expand the Supreme Court, frustrated that the current justices were rejecting many of his New Deal programs. But the Constitution does not specify a particular number of justices; there have been as few as five and as many as 10 over the nation’s history.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOutside pressure has been building for Biden to do and say more, especially about the kind of justice he would nominate. “He has to,” said Shaunna Thomas, the co-founder of UltraViolet, a women’s group. “He’s in a unique position as the candidate to help people understand exactly what is at stake.”\\n\\nBiden advisers are determined not to bow to forces urging them to change their approach. They have long been content focusing voter attention on Trump’s widely criticized handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and are reluctant to get enmeshed in a fight that could alienate centrist voters. On Sunday, Biden aimed to draw a direct connection between the court battle and the virus, citing the threats a more conservative panel would pose to the ACA.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“If Donald Trump has his way, the complications from covid-19 . . . like lung scarring and heart damage, could become the next deniable preexisting condition,” Biden said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDemocrats fear a new conservative justice succeeding the liberal Ginsburg could tilt the court to the right and tip the outcome on high-profile cases for decades to come. Biden said the environment and the rights of voters, immigrants and women were also at stake. But he avoided specific mention of some divisive topics such as guns and only briefly made a reference to abortion rights.\\n\\nAlthough Biden’s advisers believe that the vacancy could energize voters concerned about issues like health care and women’s rights, they do not plan to make the court a primary part of their campaign message.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It highlights the importance of the role of the president,” said Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.), co-chairman of Biden’s campaign. “This will double down on the seriousness of this election. If the 200,000 covid deaths didn’t do it, this will do it.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis tempered view of how to handle the vacancy is partly due to polling reviewed by the Biden team showing that most voters are not familiar with the Supreme Court’s activities. “You can expect it to come up in a way that reinforces the core message, but we’re not going to reorient our campaign around a set of talking points that only resonates with D.C. insiders and court watchers,” said one Biden adviser.\\n\\nRepublican leaders, by contrast, hope a divisive battle will revive their flagging efforts to keep the presidency and the Senate in the November election by providing GOP voters who have soured on Trump incentive to put aside their differences.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Biden knows that he is an empty vessel for the radical left, and that’s why he’s refusing to be honest with the American people about who he would want on the court,” Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said in a statement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhile Biden has said he has been working on a list of potential nominees, he defended his decision not to publicize it. “Putting a judge’s name on a list like that could influence that person’s decision-making as a judge — and that would be wrong,” he said.\\n\\nAfter committing during the primary to appointing a Black woman, he has rarely talked about the Supreme Court.\\n\\nThe Democratic presidential nominee steered clear of another Republican target Sunday by making no mention of expanding the court. While he has not referenced it explicitly since Ginsburg’s death, Biden has in the past been adamantly opposed to the idea.\\n\\n“I think it’s a bad idea,” he said in August 2019 during a trip to Iowa. “It will come back to bite us. It should not be a political football.”\\n\\nWhether Biden and the Democrats can stop Republicans from confirming Trump’s forthcoming nominee remains an open question. They received a boost on Sunday when Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) joined Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) in opposition to taking up a nominee so close to the election. Under the current balance of the Senate, Republicans can afford only one more defection, assuming the entire Democratic caucus stays unified in opposition.\\n\\nOne area where the Biden team believes the vacancy could be helpful is among women under 40, who have been slow to rally behind to his candidacy. The galvanizing issue for many of these voters is the possibility of losing abortion rights if Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case guaranteeing the right to an abortion, is overturned.\\n\\nOutside the campaign, some Democratic-aligned groups plan to focus more intently on the court fight over the next few weeks. Leaders of women's groups and liberal organizations immediately began discussing a 50-state march intended to echo both the 2016 Women’s March and the demonstrations in 2018 after Kavanaugh joined the court.\\n\\n“A real uprising, that has got to be [Ginsburg’s] legacy,” said Hilary Rosen, a Democratic strategist close to the Biden campaign and the co-founder of Times Up Legal Defense Fund, an organization to help survivors of sexual harassment.\\n\\nThe demonstrations will be geared toward motivating voter turnout and might be organized as marches to the polls, Rosen said.\\n\\nGinsburg’s death, and the resulting vacancy, has already had an enormous impact on the party’s fundraising. ActBlue, a clearinghouse for Democratic donations, announced Sunday it had raised $100 million from small-dollar donors since news broke Friday night of Ginsburg’s death.\"}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-central-florida-latino-evangelicals-could-give-trump-an-edge/2020/10/06/39c1d824-fd19-11ea-9ceb-061d646d9c67_story.html', 'Full Text': \"Many of his fellow evangelical worshipers at a large Latino church in Central Florida will probably vote for Trump, too.\\n\\n“When I think about politics overall, I’m always looking at things through my religious upbringing,” said Vazquez, 51, who lives in a suburb of Orlando. “And when I compare Trump to Biden, Trump is just closer to what I believe.”\\n\\n“Trump has his flaws,” he added. “There are things he does that I do not agree with.

Now, Republicans hope these voters will further chip away at the margins of Joe Biden’s support in Florida among Latinos. Despite the administration’s hard-line immigration policies and much-criticized response after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, some recent polls have shown the president narrowly beating Biden among Latinos overall in Florida.\\n\\n“Evangelicals value life, freedom, and limited government — values President Trump is fighting to protect,” Ali Pardo, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, said in a statement. “While Joe Biden’s campaign tries to hide his nearly half-century record of failure that focused on winning over American socialists and appeasing Latin American dictators, our campaign is on the ground in Florida connecting directly with Latino and Evangelical Communities.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat message has resonated with some voters, even though Biden is a moderate Democrat who has rejected many ideas from his party’s left flank, such as defunding the police and the “Green New Deal.” In a tight race, even a small number of voters could make a difference.\\n\\nAnd the Trump campaign’s efforts to win over more Latino voters run through churches such as the one Vazquez belongs to, which is Pentecostal.\\n\\nThe political courtship has transpired pew by pew, said several evangelical faith leaders and Florida political strategists, who describe how the Trump campaign has carefully targeted evangelical Latinos with political recognition, high-profile surrogates and digital ads. Throughout this year, amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Trump campaign has hosted dozens of virtual events with Latino evangelical worshipers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Biden campaign launched a Latino-focused faith outreach program more recently, in mid-September.\\n\\nIt is a missed opportunity for Democrats, said the Rev. Luis Cortés Jr., an evangelical leader in Philadelphia. Cortés said Latino evangelicals are less conservative than White evangelicals and are open to Democratic priorities such as racial justice and a strong social safety net, especially now that the pandemic is disproportionately hurting Latino communities.\\n\\n“Hispanic evangelicals are not a monolith,” Cortés said. “They are not all straight-line culture-issue voters. Some people will vote on the basis of schools, others on the basis of jobs.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe added: “And there's a bigger group that is starting to . . . ask what it means to be pro-life. Is pro-life a person who fights for a child to be born and then abandons the child from a moment of birth?”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“My opinion is that [Democrats] don’t know how to speak to us,” he said. “And as a result, they lose votes.”\\n\\nThere is limited public polling of these voters, and the campaigns declined to share internal polling data.

He was even given opportunities as a child to help lead worship services and to occasionally deliver short sermons. Church was foundational not only in terms of providing a sense of community but also in creating opportunities for leadership.\\n\\nToday, Vazquez has nuanced political views that reflect various facets of his life, including his Puerto Rican ancestry and New York roots, but his primary views are informed by church fellowship.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nVazquez said he supports strong border enforcement because allowing people to live in the country illegally leaves them open to being exploited for their labor. He would like to see an immigration overhaul that includes a pathway to citizenship for those who are already in the country. Asked whether he is bothered by Trump’s dark rhetoric about immigrants, Vazquez said politicians on the left also use illegal immigration to rile up political passions without doing anything to help those migrants.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhile he personally opposes abortion, he said he is wary of the Supreme Court becoming overly political and believes in a separation between church and state.\\n\\n“If everything went according to our biblical point of you, yes, we would be happy,” he said. “But the United States was not based only on a biblical point of view. Our country is based on the Constitution.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn any case, his mind is made up. Vazquez will vote for Trump, as he did in 2016.\\n\\nThese days, he barely skims the mountains of political mailers he receives. Trump’s recent coronavirus diagnosis, for all the attention it has received, did not change his mind. “I appreciated his comment about not letting fear rule our lives,” Vazquez said of Trump. “For me, it demonstrates courage to move forward.”\\n\\nThe Biden campaign has expanded its outreach to religious Latino voters in recent weeks, said Josh Dickson, who joined the campaign as faith engagement director in August. The campaign also recently announced a seven-figure advertising campaign in several battleground states, including Florida, to target religious voters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“We’re taught to seek to serve and not to be served,” Dickson said. “And that’s the exact opposite of what we see from this administration.”\\n\\nBut some say the Democrats are years behind.\\n\\nFernand Amandi, a veteran Democratic campaign strategist in Florida, recalled the aggressive play for religious Hispanic voters George W. Bush made during his presidential campaign 20 years ago. By 2004, Bush was able to get about 40 percent of the Hispanic vote, according to national exit polls. Amandi said Bush accomplished that in part by tapping into the organizing power of evangelical Latino churches.\\n\\n“The Republicans out-hustle and outfox the Democrats,” he said, “so that rather than losing by what they typically should be losing the Hispanic vote by — 30 points or more — they only lose by 20 or 15 or five points.”\\n\\nAmandi said Obama’s reelection campaign in 2012, which he advised, was successful in part because of in-depth research and early outreach to Latinos.\\n\\nPablo Jiménez, an instructor of pastoral theology in Charlotte, lamented that Democratic political candidates have not done more outreach to religious voters outside Black churches. Jiménez, a political independent who dislikes Trump, said that could be accomplished by framing “pro-life” policies to religious voters beyond the fight over abortion rights to include positions on welfare for the poor, education and health care, to name a few.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“If you ask me why so many Latinos are moving to a more conservative camp politically, it is very, very, very simple — because Republicans ask for their vote,” said Jiménez, associate dean of Hispanic ministries at the Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary.\\n\\nJiménez said he has also seen evangelicals bombarded by anti-Biden falsehoods being spread on the Internet, some targeting the former vice president for his Catholic faith.\\n\\nA pastor who Jiménez said “is like a mother to me” recently sent him a list of baseless claims, including one that insisted Biden would bring the entire world under a single global currency as part of an insidious power play. Another warned non-Catholic religious voters that Biden would bring their faiths under the rule of the pope.\\n\\n“I have had friends telling me that they’ve been marginalized in their church because they’re not peddling right-wing stuff or conspiracy theories,” Jiménez said.\\n\\nThese trends have collided in Orlando, seen as a crucial battleground for Democrats seeking to counterbalance the GOP’s strength among Cuban Americans in South Florida. Among the influx of Puerto Rican voters who have arrived since Hurricane Maria struck the island in 2017, many have conservative religious and political leanings.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhile many Puerto Ricans are angry at the Trump administration’s response to Hurricane Maria, factors such as religious affiliation can influence their vote as well in ways that are not always understood by political strategists.\\n\\n“The Puerto Rican community in Orlando differs from those in New York or Philly or Chicago, because you have a very large number of people coming from the island as well as other parts of the United States, and that’s where you will find a larger number of people sympathizing with the Republican Party,” said Jorge Duany, director of the Cuban Research Institute in Miami.\\n\\nMany of them identify as White, he added, which may also diminish the strength of the Democrats’ messaging on racial justice.\\n\\n“It would be a mistake to take us for granted, to say, ‘Oh, they’re Latino, so they’ll vote Democrat,’ or, ‘Oh they’re evangelical so they’ll vote Republican.’ What happens when you live in both identities?” said the Rev. Gabriel Salguero, who is president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition and delivered the opening prayer of the Democratic National Convention in August.\\n\\nAnd their strength could extend beyond the 2020 election.\\n\\nLatino evangelicals are the fastest-growing group of evangelicals in the United States, he said, “and many live in Florida, North Carolina, Colorado, Nevada.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, with this year’s election underway, Vazquez knows that liberals are apt to criticize Latinos who vote for Trump.\\n\\nBut he wishes voters like him could be seen with more complexity.\\n\\n“I have not always voted Republican. And even in the most recent elections, some of my statewide elected preferences were not all Republicans,” he said.\"}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/texas-political-geography/', 'Full Text': 'Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events\\n\\nAnalysis close Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events\\n\\n(Lauren Tierney/The Washington Post) ([object Object])\\n\\nNinth in a series on swing states\\n\\nModern Texas as a swing state? Democrats started to dream it after 2008, when Barack Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate since Lyndon B. Johnson to carry Texas’s biggest urban counties. Republicans started to warn about it in 2013, when Obama campaign veterans created a group to find and empower hundreds of thousands of non-White Texans who didn’t vote. One year later, Republicans dominated every statewide race — as they had for 20 years — and made inroads with Hispanic voters. “Blue Texas” became a punchline.\\n\\nThen came Donald Trump. In 2016, after dispatching Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas to win the Republican nomination, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton here by nine points — a smaller margin than any Republican nominee since Bob Dole. It got closer because of Trump’s weakness in the state’s fast-growing cities and suburbs, which optimistic Republicans saw as a fluke. Two years later, Democrats picked up two House seats, sliced away at the GOP’s state legislative majority and came within five points of winning several statewide races, including the one for Cruz’s seat.\\n\\n“The suburbs are abandoning Donald Trump,” said Julián Castro, a Texan and the former secretary of housing and urban development under Obama who has been raising money and campaigning for down-ballot Democrats since ending his presidential bid. “All the dynamics are coming to fruition to make this a swing state. If Democrats can get lower-propensity voters in the Rio Grande Valley and the big metro areas to turn out, I’m convinced we’d get over the hump.”\\n\\nHow Texas swung from ‘12 to ’16 Clinton made big gains in cities and suburbs, cutting the GOP’s margin of victory to single digits for the first time in 20 years.

Republicans held on to their statewide offices, despite further suburban attrition, thanks to high turnout in conservative East and North Texas and middling Democratic turnout with Latino voters in the Rio Grande Valley.\\n\\nIt’s a very big hump. Clinton carried four of Texas’s five most populous counties, containing the cities of Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth, Austin and San Antonio, and where a total of 3,809,602 votes were cast. But 57 percent of the total statewide vote came from outside those counties. Unlike Arizona, where defeat in the suburbs can close off the GOP’s path to a majority, Texas has millions of rural, White, conservative voters who are alienated from the modern Democratic Party and can overwhelm it with high turnout.\\n\\nThose voters have elected a Republican Party that’s made voting tougher, under pandemic conditions, than in any 2020 swing state. Of the 15 states where Joe Biden’s presidential campaign has run TV ads, only Texas requires voters to have a medical reason to request an absentee ballot, unless they’re 65 or older. Republican state legislators have nixed the state’s old straight-ticket option, after 2018’s Democratic surge led to massive down-ballot wins in urban counties.\\n\\nAnd just this week, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott mandated that each of Texas’s 254 counties maintain just one drop box for mail ballots, to “maintain the integrity of our election.” Rural Loving County, with just 169 residents, would have as many drop-off points as Houston’s Harris County, with more than 4.7 million residents. Democrats, who went to court immediately to challenge this, saw it as evidence that Republicans are nervous.\\n\\nWant more like this? It’s in The Trailer.

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy\\n\\nTo explain why Texas is being contested at all, we’ve broken it into seven political “states.” Houston and its exurbs have moved away from Republicans in the past few years, adding tens of thousands of Democratic voters as White suburbanites and immigrants turn against the president. West Texas, the least populous of these regions, has become more Democratic, and so has the Rio Grande Valley, which Republicans saw only recently as places where they could pick up votes. A mystery in both regions, to be solved on Election Day, is whether Trump’s support from Hispanic voters has grown or declined since 2016; polling is all over the map.\\n\\nThe Hill Country, a vast region with liberal Austin at the center, has become more competitive as that city’s gotten bluer. So has the Metroplex of Dallas and Fort Worth — still red, but Republicans’ losses in smaller cities are eating away at their margin. The GOP’s strength is in the other two regions, North and East Texas, with some of the most solidly Republican towns in the country. In 2018, they were enough to overwhelm massive Democratic gains in the rest of the state.\\n\\nThis is the ninth in a series breaking down the key swing states of 2020, showing how electoral trends played out over the past few years and where the shift in votes really mattered.

(Lauren Tierney/The Washington Post) ([object Object]) One in 5 Texan voters live here, between Houston itself and the small Gulf Coast towns down Highway 288 and Interstate 45, and their shift away from the GOP has scrambled statewide politics. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney lost Harris County itself by a handful of votes but won the region overall by 80,000. Four years later, Clinton dominated Harris County, picked up Fort Bend County and built a 120,000-vote cushion here, giving Democrats hope of eventually winning statewide. Republicans have fought back since then, with mixed success, limiting the Democrats’ 2018 gains but losing a House seat in the Houston “energy corridor” — the place where George H.W. Bush started his political career. Just 29 percent of Harris County residents, and 32 percent of Fort Bend County residents, are non-Hispanic Whites, and in both counties, more than 1 in 4 residents were born outside the United States. Local Democratic candidates such as Sri Preston Kulkarni have made calls and sent voter mail in multiple South Asian languages, and Republicans such as Rep. Dan Crenshaw have worked to recruit more diverse candidates, like Black congressional challenger and former Apache pilot Wesley Hunt. 2016 vote total Donald Trump 809,817 Hillary Clinton 930,013 2016 vote totals Donald Trump: 809,817\\n\\nHillary Clinton: 930,013 Counties included: Brazoria, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris\\n\\nWest Texas Compared with the state overall, the voting population here … Has a higher share of people living in cities than average .\\n\\nof people living in cities than average .

(Lauren Tierney/The Washington Post) ([object Object]) Before Beto O’Rourke broke records for Democratic fundraising in Texas — and before an ill-advised campaign for president — he was viewed skeptically as a statewide candidate because he came from El Paso. Thinly populated West Texas had never been a launchpad for Texas politicians, and while oil exploration in the Permian Basin was a steady source of jobs, there was none of the fast, diverse population growth that was reshaping such places as Houston and Dallas. Still, Republican losses here can hurt them statewide. Romney held Obama to a victory of fewer than 9,000 votes here; Clinton won by 66,000 votes, helped by record-breaking turnout in El Paso County, and she won in smaller cities such as Midland. O’Rourke improved on those numbers, but even another broken record in 2020 would net Democrats fewer votes than they’ll get out of the Houston area. 2016 vote total Donald Trump 138,729 Hillary Clinton 185,185 2016 vote totals Donald Trump: 138,729\\n\\nHillary Clinton: 185,185 Counties included: Brewster, Crane, Crockett, Culberson, Ector, El Paso, Hudspeth, Jeff Davis, Loving, Midland, Pecos, Presidio, Reeves, Terrell, Upton, Val Verde, Ward, Winkler\\n\\nHill Country Compared with the state overall, the voting population here … Has a lower share of people living in cities than average .\\n\\nof people living in cities than average .

(Lauren Tierney/The Washington Post) ([object Object]) Settled by German immigrants, and loyal for decades to the old Republican Party, this region is increasingly defined by the explosive growth of Austin. That’s been a boon to Democrats. More than half of all votes here come from Austin’s Travis County and neighboring Williamson County, and while Republicans wrote off Travis years ago, the combined Democrat margin in that area rose from 60,000 in 2012 to 160,000 votes in 2016. The rest of Hill Country is redder, though seven of its more rural counties shifted to the left slightly in 2016. That’s been a problem for Republicans: They drew legislative maps in 2011 that sliced up Austin into several districts, on the assumption that the exurbs would stay red. Even if the presidential campaigns don’t invest much here, the races in the 10th, 21st and 25th districts could drive up turnout. 2016 vote total Donald Trump 501,788 Hillary Clinton 517,428 2016 vote totals Donald Trump: 501,788\\n\\nHillary Clinton: 517,428 Counties included: Bandera, Bell, Blanco, Bosque, Burnet, Comal, Coryell, Edwards, Gillespie, Hamilton, Hays, Kendall, Kerr, Kimble, Kinney, Lampasas, Llano, Mason, McCulloch, Medina, Menard, Mills, Real, San Saba, Schleicher, Sutton, Travis, Uvalde, Williamson\\n\\nRio Grande Valley Compared with the state overall, the voting population here … Has a higher share of people living in cities than average .\\n\\nof people living in cities than average .

(Lauren Tierney/The Washington Post) ([object Object]) Tejano Texas, settled by Mexicans who lost many of their rights when the state joined the union, had its political power limited for decades by a poll tax, for years set at $1.75. In the 1940s, Democrats organized in the area to pay potential voters’ fees, and the region from San Antonio’s Bexar County to the U.S.-Mexico border has ever since been the part of Texas most resistant to Republicans. Even George W. Bush lost it during his two runs for president, and in 2016, Clinton won it with the biggest margins of any Democratic nominee in 20 years. Republicans never stopped competing here, though, flipping a state Senate seat in a 2018 special election and narrowly holding the 23rd Congressional District, which is open this year after the retirement of Rep. Will Hurd. The areas around the region’s military bases are strongly Republican, and the multiyear Democratic project to find more votes here has been complicated by Republicans’ own outreach to socially conservative Hispanic voters. But Republicans such as Abbott and Cruz have had more luck with that than Trump. 2016 vote total Donald Trump 415,168 Hillary Clinton 645,306 2016 vote totals Donald Trump: 415,168\\n\\nHillary Clinton: 645,306 Counties included: Atascosa, Bexar, Brooks, Cameron, Dimmit, Duval, Frio, Hidalgo, Jim Hogg, Jim Wells, Kenedy, Kleberg, La Salle, Maverick, Nueces, Starr, Webb, Willacy, Zapata, Zavala\\n\\nMetroplex Compared with the state overall, the voting population here … Has a higher share of people living in cities than average .\\n\\nof people living in cities than average .

(Lauren Tierney/The Washington Post) ([object Object]) Dallas has been a Democratic stronghold for decades. Fort Worth has been one of the most Republican-friendly large cities in America. The suburbs and exurbs of both, which have doubled in size since 2000, padded the GOP’s numbers, putting Texas far out of Democrats’ reach. But that’s begun to change, with cities like Plano and Denton turning blue and Democratic landslides in the core Metroplex wiping out Republican state legislators. The clash between the country club GOP and the Trump-era GOP — epitomized when arch-conservative Allen West became state GOP chairman — is vivid here. Katrina Pierson, the lead of the Trump campaign’s Black outreach, got her start with an unsuccessful 2014 primary run against a Metroplex congressman in a then-safe seat. Four years later, Republican Rep. Pete Sessions was defeated in a general election, and Democrats are trying to stretch their map in the region to flip the state legislature. O’Rourke fought Cruz to a draw here, but where the suburban growth stops, Republicans remain dominant. 2016 vote total Donald Trump 1,230,220 Hillary Clinton 1,070,816 2016 vote totals Donald Trump: 1,230,220\\n\\nHillary Clinton: 1,070,816 Counties included: Collin, Dallas, Denton, Ellis, Grayson, Hood, Johnson, Kaufman, Parker, Rockwall, Tarrant\\n\\nNorth Texas Compared with the state overall, the voting population here … Has a lower share of people living in cities than average .\\n\\nof people living in cities than average .

(Lauren Tierney/The Washington Post) ([object Object]) The president has lost traditional Republican support in much of Texas, but not in the massive region north and west of Dallas. The 13th Congressional District, the single most Republican-friendly seat in the country, will send the president’s former physician to Congress in November, after Trump’s support for Ronny L. Jackson powered him through a primary against Republicans with stronger local ties. Since 2000, no Democratic nominee for president has won a single county here; in 2016, Clinton couldn’t reach even 30 percent support in any of them. There could be more Republican votes to win here, though this is the only part of Texas where most counties have been losing population. The area around Amarillo has been growing, albeit slower than most Texas cities, and Democrats added votes there in 2016 and 2018. But in a presidential year, even a weak Republican campaign should come out of here with a margin of 300,000 votes, as nothing is trending toward Democrats. 2016 vote total Donald Trump 464,204 Hillary Clinton 116,611 2016 vote totals Donald Trump: 464,204\\n\\nHillary Clinton: 116,611 Counties included: Andrews, Archer, Armstrong, Bailey, Baylor, Borden, Briscoe, Brown, Callahan, Carson, Castro, Childress, Clay, Cochran, Coke, Coleman, Collingsworth, Comanche, Concho, Cooke, Cottle, Crosby, Dallam, Dawson, Deaf Smith, Dickens, Donley, Eastland, Erath, Fisher, Floyd, Foard, Gaines, Garza, Glasscock, Gray, Hale, Hall, Hansford, Hardeman, Hartley, Haskell, Hemphill, Hockley, Howard, Hutchinson, Irion, Jack, Jones, Kent, King, Knox, Lamb, Lipscomb, Lubbock, Lynn, Martin, Mitchell, Montague, Moore, Motley, Nolan, Ochiltree, Oldham, Palo Pinto, Parmer, Potter, Randall, Reagan, Roberts, Runnels, Scurry, Shackelford, Sherman, Somervell, Stephens, Sterling, Stonewall, Swisher, Taylor, Terry, Throckmorton, Tom Green, Wheeler, Wichita, Wilbarger, Wise, Yoakum, Young'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/02/daily-202-dozen-questions-gauge-political-ramifications-trumps-coronavirus-diagnosis/', 'Full Text': 'AD\\n\\nThis October surprise upends the presidential campaign with just over a month until Election Day. This will draw fresh attention to Trump’s public and private squabbles with a number of the medical experts in his administration over how seriously to take the virus. The diagnosis will also make it difficult for the president to deflect attention to other issues. But it is impossible at this moment to state anything with certitude. How exactly this development impacts the final 32 days of the race depends on the answers to these dozen questions:\\n\\n1) How sick will the president get?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAn unnamed White House official told the Associated Press this morning that the president is experiencing “mild symptoms” but did not specify.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe president’s physician, Sean Conley, said in a statement that the Trumps “are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence.”\\n\\n“We are feeling good,” the first lady tweeted this morning.\\n\\nRonny Jackson, Trump’s former White House physician who is now running for Congress in Texas, called into Fox News overnight to claim, without appearing to have first-hand information, that the president is asymptomatic. “I will bet you that he does not develop symptoms, that he moves on and this does not become a big deal,” Jackson said, adding that the president will “weather this storm.”\\n\\n“Covid-19 has proved particularly lethal for older people, especially those who are obese and have preëxisting conditions. Trump is seventy-four and overweight,” writes New Yorker editor David Remnick. “According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, eight out of ten covid-19-related deaths in the United States have been of people sixty-five and older. Trump’s doctors say that he is generally healthy—though, on November 16, 2019, Trump was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and Vice-President Mike Pence was reportedly placed on standby. The reasons for that hospital visit remain obscure. At one point, the President went out of his way to deny that he had suffered ‘mini-strokes.’”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n2) Who else close to the president has the virus?\\n\\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel disclosed this morning, through her spokesman, that she tested positive a few days ago. McDaniel appeared Thursday on Fox News but did not mention her diagnosis. She was with last with Trump at a Sept. 25 fundraiser and has been at her home in Michigan since last Saturday. The RNC statement said McDaniel received confirmation on Wednesday afternoon that she was positive and that she had chosen to get tested after a member of her family had tested positive.\\n\\nThe president got tested after his senior aide Hope Hicks came down with the virus. “Hicks traveled with the president to Pennsylvania for a rally Saturday, to Cleveland for the first presidential debate Tuesday and to Minnesota for another campaign rally Wednesday. Hicks was around the president and top political advisers extensively in recent days preparing for the debate,” Josh Dawsey and Colby Itkowitz report. “She was photographed without a mask at the Pennsylvania rally clapping to the Village People’s ‘YMCA’ with other Trump aides and in Cleveland on the tarmac deplaning Air Force One. Her positive test came after she began showing symptoms at the Wednesday rally. A person familiar with the situation said Hicks was quarantined on the plane trip back from Minnesota. …\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“After White House officials learned of Hicks’s symptoms, Trump and his entourage flew Thursday to New Jersey, where he attended a fundraiser at his golf club in Bedminster and delivered a speech. Trump was in close contact with dozens of other people, including campaign supporters, at a roundtable event. The president did not wear a mask Thursday, including at the events at his golf course and on the plane … Two people who spent time with him said he did not show noticeable symptoms although he seemed tired and acknowledged to other aides later Thursday that Hicks was ill. … Some aides are expected to stay at home for the foreseeable future … Some members of the Secret Service have also contracted the virus while preparing for presidential events, The Washington Post has reported.”\\n\\nVice President Pence and second lady Karen Pence both tested negative this morning, according to the White House.\\n\\nIn May, Pence spokeswoman Katie Miller caught the virus. In July, the president’s son Donald Trump Jr. tested positive and so did national security adviser Robert O’Brien. But the president continued to test negative at that time.\\n\\n3) How transparent will the White House be about the president’s condition?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe White House’s willingness to make demonstrably false statements has undermined its credibility going into a perilous period for the presidency. Moreover, there is a long history of White Houses downplaying the severity of presidential health problems, from President Ronald Reagan’s condition after he was shot in 1981 to President Franklin Roosevelt’s polio.\\n\\n4) What kind of schedule will Trump keep while convalescing?\\n\\nEven if he’s feeling fine, how long does the president stay inside the White House? Aides say Trump still plans to host a conference call on covid-19 support for vulnerable seniors at 12:15 p.m. from the residence. But a fundraiser at Trump’s hotel in Washington and a rally in Florida that were scheduled for later in the day were both scrapped.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n5) Will Trump change his tone about the virus? If so, for how long?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDuring a prerecorded speech that played at the Al Smith charity dinner in New York on Thursday night, just hours before he revealed his diagnosis, Trump exuded the same optimism that he has for months. “I just want to say that the end of the pandemic is in sight,” the president declared, “and next year will be one of the greatest years in the history of our country.”\\n\\n6) How will Joe Biden adjust?\\n\\nThe Democratic presidential nominee is scheduled to hold two in-person events today in Grand Rapids, Mich. His running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), is scheduled to stump in Las Vegas. Neither trip has been canceled. Biden’s campaign has not answered questions about when he was last tested, but he tweeted this morning that he and his wife wish the first couple a swift recovery: “We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family,” Biden wrote.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOnly hours before Trump tested positive, the Biden campaign announced plans to begin knocking on doors of prospective voters this weekend after saying for months that doing so was unsafe and unnecessary during the pandemic. But the Trump campaign’s advantage on in-person canvassing had made Democrats nervous. Republicans have said their canvassers have already knocked on 19 million doors. Will the Biden campaign still move forward with its door-knocking plans?\\n\\nBiden is also on television with attack ads against Trump. If the president’s condition worsens, that could seem to be in poor taste. Will either campaign pull any of its commercials off the air?\\n\\n7) Will there be more debates?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe hot topic of conversation in politics yesterday was what changes might be made to the format for the second and third presidential debates to keep them more orderly than the first. Now the question is whether there will be any more in-person debates at all. The vice-presidential candidates are scheduled to debate next week in Salt Lake City.\\n\\n8) Will Trump resume large-scale campaign rallies?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump really hoped to rev up his travel schedule in the final weeks. This throws a wrench in those plans. Already, he was under fire for going to Wisconsin on Saturday despite the state becoming a coronavirus hot spot. Wisconsin reported a record-high 2,887 new cases and 21 more deaths on Thursday. The number of people hospitalized with the virus has skyrocketed over the last week, and Gov. Tony Evers (D) has urged Wisconsinites to stay home, according to the Journal Sentinel.\\n\\nAt Tuesday’s debate, Trump defended having big rallies where no one is required to wear facial coverings or to socially distance. “We’ve had no negative effect,” the president said. Biden said that was “totally irresponsible” and his opponent is being foolish. Trump replied: “If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing. But you can’t. Nobody cares.”\\n\\nIf Trump resumes rallies, it’s possible that some supporters who might have gone choose to stay away out of an abundance of caution.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n9) Will public sympathy lead to a bounce in the polls or are attitudes too hardened for that?\\n\\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson saw a bump in his approval rating this spring after he recovered from the coronavirus. The 56-year-old was treated on a ventilator in an intensive care unit. “His personal approval ratings skyrocketed from 44% in mid-March to 66% on April 13, immediately after he exited the ICU.

The draft complaint also alleged that Guilfoyle spoke incessantly and luridly about her sex life, and on one occasion demanded a massage of her bare thighs; other times, she said, Guilfoyle told her to submit to a Fox employee’s demands for sexual favors, encouraged her to sleep with wealthy and powerful men, asked her to critique her naked body, demanded that she share a room with her on business trips, required her to sleep over at her apartment, and exposed herself to her, making her feel deeply uncomfortable.\\n\\n“As serious as the draft complaint’s sexual-harassment allegations were, equally disturbing was what the assistant described as a coverup attempt by Guilfoyle … According to those familiar with the assistant’s draft complaint, during a phone call on August 6, 2017, she alleged that Guilfoyle tried to buy her silence, offering to arrange a payment to her if she agreed to lie [to a team of outside lawyers hired to investigate sexual misconduct in the company]. … [The lawyers] begun investigating accusations of workplace sexual misconduct involving Eric Bolling, with whom Guilfoyle shared the assistant. … It was all but inevitable that if the assistant accused Bolling of sexual harassment — as in fact she did — Guilfoyle’s conduct would come under scrutiny next. … Guilfoyle told her that she needed to know what the assistant would say if she were asked about sexual harassment, and warned her that she could cause great damage if she said the wrong thing.”\\n\\nMike Pompeo’s politicking is wearing down the patience of allies.\\n\\n“Foreign officials have accused him of trying to drag their governments into the election battle,\" Foreign Policy reports. “The problem was clearly on display this week during Pompeo’s visit to the Vatican, where Pope Francis refused to meet with the secretary during his visit, with Vatican officials accusing the secretary of state of trying to drag the Holy See into the 2020 U.S. election by criticizing its relations with China.

Eventually, Netanyahu’s backers craved their own show of force. They found it in a group of soccer fans.\\n\\nThat group, La Familia, is composed of infamously racist “ultras” who support the team Beitar Jerusalem. On their face, ultras are highly organized fans; at games, they lead raucous chants, unfurl massive banners and set off flares. In practice, they can operate as members of a street gang united by criminality, ideology or a little bit of both.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBeitar is the unofficial team of Israel’s political right. It is the only club in the Israeli Premier League never to have had an Arab player on its roster, and it is Netanyahu’s favorite team. So as the summer’s protests swept Jerusalem, Likud activist Amnon Ben Ami put the call out for the ultras on his popular Facebook page: “La Familia, you are the medicine against those anarchists.”\\n\\nWith the 2019-20 season over, La Familia was available and, apparently, spoiling for a fight. On several nights in July, La Familia members marauded through the masses at the anti-Netanyahu protests. Draped in Israeli flags, they sat on friends’ shoulders or happily shoved each other around makeshift mosh pits. “This is the land of Israel, this is the Jewish state, I hate all the Arabs,” they sang. “Where are the whores of antifa?” they shouted, then added a clap, clap, clap clap clap.\\n\\nAs they roamed, they lashed out violently without knowing exactly whom they were targeting. Haaretz reporter Nir Hasson watched La Familia pursue a Palestinian man in a car, chasing him on foot and then hurling a molotov cocktail at his vehicle. Anti-Netanyahu protesters also reported being threatened by La Familia members flashing knives and asking, “Want to get stabbed?” According to another Haaretz reporter, La Familia beat up a man carrying a flag they believed was Palestinian but was in fact Rastafarian. One La Familia member was an Israel Defense Forces soldier, proudly carrying his army rifle in a blatant show of intimidation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt first glance, it was a bizarre, pointless show of force. But to longtime La Familia watchers, it made perfect sense and could be traced to an incident earlier in the month.\\n\\nOn July 21, at an anti-Netanyahu protest outside the Knesset, a female demonstrator climbed a giant menorah statue and removed her shirt. A photo of her spread quickly across social media. Sophia Solomon, a doctoral student at Ben-Gurion University who conducted a three-year study of La Familia, contends that image energized the group’s members, who she says view themselves as defenders not of Netanyahu but of the sacred symbols of the state of Israel.\\n\\nThe protester on the menorah “had the guts,” Solomon says, “to go and hilool kodesh” — to violate the holy. So in response, La Familia raged.\\n\\nA tradition of hate\\n\\nBeitar Jerusalem was founded in 1936, before the creation of the state of Israel, as a youth club associated with the hardcore Zionist Beitar movement. It fielded players who were also members of Etzel, an infamous pre-state militia that carried out terrorist attacks and massacres on the local Arab population. “The tradition of extreme views against the Arab population was always there,” Solomon has said. “It’s innate.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIsrael’s traditional power structures have historically been dominated by Ashkenazi Jews, meaning Jews with origins in Europe. Beitar is known as the club for Mizrahi Jews, whose origins are in the Arab world. In 2018, Knesset member Miri Regev, a prominent defender of Mizrahi interests, attended a Beitar game, grinning for the cameras as fans around her repeated the anti-Arab chant, “May your village be burned.” Despite that kind of overt political support and despite Beitar being one of the Israeli Premier League’s traditional powerhouses, the team’s fans see themselves as eternal underdogs.\\n\\nLa Familia, created in 2005, is the Beitar fandom’s racist hardcore. On its inflammatory Facebook page, it has 38,000 members. Solomon says the number of active La Familia members probably is a few thousand but “even the police doesn’t know” the exact number.\\n\\nA few years ago, a national raid led to arrests of 19 La Familia members on charges ranging from racist acts to attempted murder. “It’s a semi-anarchist group,” Solomon says, with a loose structure: an “inner ring” of 30-something decision-makers and an “outer ring” of 16- and 17-year-old “executors” who take to the streets. By their late 30s, she says, members age out: “You retire from violence.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn 2013, Beitar Jerusalem tried, in a roundabout way, to signal the end of its racist boycott of Arab players by signing two young Muslim players. The players weren’t Arabs — they were from Chechnya — but La Familia still pounced. At a game, members held up a sign reading “Beitar: Forever Pure”; later, they set a fire in Beitar’s trophy room. Beitar’s general manager, a former club legend named Itzik Kornfein, insisted on holding a hard line against La Familia, to try to break its hold over the club. But by the next season, the Chechens were gone. Kornfein followed not long after.\\n\\nAlon Burstein is a former Beitar fan who abandoned his allegiance after 2013. By not insisting that the Chechens stay, “the club signaled to La Familia, ‘We don’t want to fight you,’ ” he says. “The fans chanting racism, making our society so much worse — it was hard for me to be happy with them. But they didn’t drive me away. It was the club giving up that broke my heart.”\\n\\nWhat matters to ultras\\n\\nThe term ultras, coined in Italy in the late 1960s, has come to encompass a wide spectrum of highly organized fan groups. Ultras get in clashes with the police or with the ultras of opposing clubs. They also cheer and curse and sing. All over the world, what they have in common is their tightknit identities; even if they have families or day jobs, members are more likely to define themselves by their allegiances as ultras. They are, above all, united.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhich means the idea of a group of soccer fans acting as a cohesive protest unit isn’t as strange as it might first seem. “You’ve got hundreds, sometimes thousands of well-organized men who know how to fight,” says James Montague, the author of “1312: Among the Ultras.” “They do it week in, week out at football matches. They know what to do with tear gas.”\\n\\nHistorically, ultras have been anti-authority. The 1312 in the book’s title is the alphabet number code for ACAB, or All Cops Are Bastards. “It was a universal thing that ultras believed in,” Montague says. “ ‘We’re against the police; we’re against the government.’ ”\\n\\nRecent history is mostly full of examples of ultras supporting street actions against their governments. Egypt during the Arab Spring, Ukraine during its 2014 uprising, Turkey during the Gezi Park protests: All saw the phenomenon of soccer fans taking to the streets to ally with protesters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut as populist parties have come to power in Central and Eastern Europe, they have found common cause with ultras happy to demonize immigrants, minorities and LGBTQ communities. Far-right ultras, once seen as shameful fringe groups, now reflect their governments’ sloganeering. “It wasn’t their world 20 years ago,” Montague says. “It’s their world now.”\\n\\nPavel Klymenko, head of policy at Fare Network, an organization opposing discrimination in soccer, says that when ultras are acting on behalf of the interests of a government, there are two primary causes.\\n\\nThe first is “clientelistic”: Ultras can become willing “thugs for hire by the regime against the opposition,” as has happened in Russia and the Balkans. While it’s not inconceivable that La Familia members were somehow compensated to appear as counterprotesters, there has been no evidence to support that claim.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe second, as with La Familia, is ideological. The ultras are “supporting a cause that resonates” and happens to be “in line with government policy.” In 2019, in Bialystok, Poland, a gay pride parade was violently attacked by ultras of the club Jagiellonia Bialystok. Klymenko says their actions effectively amplified the ruling Law and Justice party’s attacks on the LGBTQ community; at a later match, Jagiellonia Bialystok supporters went so far as to “literally use the government’s imagery and talking points in their banners.”\\n\\nUltimately, La Familia’s presence did nothing to dampen the mood of the anti-Netanyahu protests. And the ultras, for now anyway, seem to have lost interest. Since their appearances at the end of July, there have been no new reported sightings of La Familia.\\n\\nThere have also been no repercussions for the group. Netanyahu has repeatedly portrayed the demonstrators calling for his resignation as lawless anarchists, but he has not addressed La Familia’s bloody provocations. In early October, under the cover of increased coronavirus restrictions, the Knesset passed a law restricting protesters’ ability to gather in public.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Israeli Premier League returned for its 2020-21 season in late August, without fans for now. Some members of La Familia have been getting their fix by gathering outside of closed-door matches. “Their addiction is going once a week to the stadium,” Solomon says. “They’re trying to do some stuff to not lose their minds.”\\n\\nWhen the stadiums do reopen, Burstein, the former Beitar fan, fears the events of the summer of 2020 will, like with the Chechens in 2013, serve to make La Familia only more powerful. “If we’re ever allowed in the stadiums again, we’re going to see a turn for the worse,” Burstein says. “They care enough about their agenda to go beat up protesters. They carry this in their hearts.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/georgia-political-geography/', 'Full Text': 'Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events\\n\\nAnalysis close Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events\\n\\n(Lauren Tierney/The Washington Post) ([object Object])\\n\\nEighth in a series on swing states\\n\\nWhen they sifted through the wreckage of the 2016 election, and reckoned with their losses in the Midwest, Democrats were surprised by what they found in Georgia. The state had not voted for a Democratic president since 1992, and it delivered 16 electoral votes for Donald Trump, continuing the pattern.\\n\\nBut something had happened in the suburbs. In defeat, Hillary Clinton had won more raw votes out of Georgia than any Democratic nominee in history, and she had carried the GOP’s longtime stronghold — the fast-growing counties just outside of Atlanta. Nearly half of the state’s votes came from the Atlanta metro region, and the modern GOP has never struggled so much there.\\n\\nEven in triumph, Republicans began to worry. Once-conservative Cobb County elected a new GOP chair on the promise to “Make Cobb Red Again.” A 2017 special election for a House seat in the county went down to the wire. One year later, Democrats flipped that seat and nearly won another in Atlanta’s suburbs, as Democratic nominee Stacey Abrams lost the closest race for governor in 24 years.\\n\\n“Democrats, let’s do better,” Abrams wrote in a 2019 memo to party leaders. “Any decision less than full investment in Georgia would amount to strategic malpractice.”\\n\\nHave Democrats put everything they could into the state since then? Arguably not — but that’s changing. Joe Biden’s cash-flush campaign has bought ads in the state, and Abrams’s group Fair Fight Georgia has registered hundreds of thousands of voters and pumped up requests for absentee ballots. The Trump campaign has not taken the state for granted, with the president dropping into Atlanta last week to roll out his “platinum plan” for Black Americans.\\n\\nGeorgia’s shift from 2012 to 2016 Clinton was the first Democrat since Carter to win Cobb and Gwinnett counties, suburban GOP strongholds.

Democrats held both houses of Georgia’s legislature until 2002 — then, in a single election, lost both, kicking off a decade of decline. Conservative Democrats below the “Gnat Line,” shorthand for where the state’s Piedmont region ends and its hotter plains begin, bolted the party and never came back.\\n\\nThe math only changed as the electorate got larger and more diverse. In 2004, when Democrats made no effort in the state, 70 percent of all voters were White, according to exit polls. In 2016, the White share of the electorate fell to 60 percent and Democrats won the state’s suburban Cobb and Gwinnett counties, for the first time since Jimmy Carter won the presidency. They added to those gains in 2018, but Republicans held out with landslide support from White voters north and south of Atlanta.\\n\\nWant more like this? It’s in The Trailer.

We’ve split Georgia into six political “states,” starting with Atlanta, where Republicans were struggling before Trump’s presidency and have lost ground since. The Atlanta suburbs, six counties with interstate access to the city, have become the state’s most competitive region. North Georgia, the Piedmont and South Georgia are solidly Republican, and the party may have some more votes to turn out there. The Black Belt, with fewer votes than these other regions, always backs Democrats — but a turnout difference of just 20,000 or 30,000 votes, with rural Black voters being enthusiastic to cast ballots and confident those ballots will count, could swing a close statewide election.\\n\\nThis is the eighth in a series breaking down the key swing states of 2020, showing how electoral trends played out over the past few years and where the shift in votes really mattered.

(Lauren Tierney/The Washington Post) ([object Object]) The “capital of the south” welcomes tens of thousands of new residents every year, and they have only made Atlanta bluer. In 2016, Clinton won more votes in the three core counties of metro Atlanta than any Democrat in history. Donald Trump won fewer votes here than any Republican nominee in 20 years. Months later, he alienated Atlanta’s Black voters further by insulting Rep. John Lewis (D), insisting that the Civil Rights icon’s district was in “horrible shape” and “infested” with crime. Lewis died this year, and Atlanta continues to get bluer. DeKalb County is one of the few majority-Black places in the country where turnout in 2016 was markedly higher than 2012, and in 2018, Abrams turned out 10,000 more voters than Clinton had — an unheard-of surge from a presidential year to a midterm. Republicans still run strong in the north end of Fulton County, around cities like Roswell — just not as strong as they once did, as those cities have grown more diverse and less conservative. 2016 vote total Donald Trump 181,710 Hillary Clinton 626,686 2016 vote totals Donald Trump: 181,710\\n\\nHillary Clinton: 626,686 Counties included: Clayton, DeKalb, Fulton\\n\\nAtlanta Burbs Compared with the state overall, the voting population here … Has a higher share of people living in cities than average .\\n\\nof people living in cities than average .

(Lauren Tierney/The Washington Post) ([object Object]) The exurbs of Atlanta were built by segregation and “White flight.” The city’s geographic expansion halted in the 1960s, when such places as Sandy Springs rejected annexation; nearby Marietta became a bulwark of White conservative politics, starting Newt Gingrich on his journey to becoming House speaker. But a steady stream of immigrants and escapees from other states has turned the region blue, with Cobb County backing Clinton by two points, then supporting Abrams by nine points. A region that gave Mitt Romney a 60,000-vote victory in 2012 gave Clinton a 48,000-vote margin, then went more solidly for Abrams and Democratic candidates, with the party picking up 11 seats in the state legislature largely through gains in these suburbs. 2016 vote total Donald Trump 404,885 Hillary Clinton 452,450 2016 vote totals Donald Trump: 404,885\\n\\nHillary Clinton: 452,450 Counties included: Cobb, Douglas, Gwinnett, Henry, Newton, Rockdale\\n\\nNorth Georgia Compared with the state overall, the voting population here … Has a lower share of people living in cities than average .\\n\\nof people living in cities than average .

(Lauren Tierney/The Washington Post) ([object Object]) The reddest part of Georgia has also been making the most news lately — conservative activist and conspiracy theorist Marjorie Taylor Greene won the Republican nomination to represent the 14th Congressional District, and the party threw up its hands. Every county in the region backed Trump in 2016, with the GOP nominee carrying all but three precincts, in the cities of Dalton and Rome. And Trump added more than 50,000 votes to Romney’s 2012 total, finding White voters without college degrees who had been sitting out elections. Democrats added some votes, too, because there was not much room to fall. In the past few decades, only Zell Miller, who’d been born in Towns County, was able to win votes here for Democrats. The GOP now clears 80 percent of the vote in most of northwestern and northeastern Georgia, and Gov. Brian Kemp’s 2018 win came after he did what looked unlikely — he made it even redder. 2016 vote total Donald Trump 549,131 Hillary Clinton 156,310 2016 vote totals Donald Trump: 549,131\\n\\nHillary Clinton: 156,310 Counties included: Banks, Bartow, Catoosa, Chattooga, Cherokee, Dade, Dawson, Elbert, Fannin, Floyd, Forsyth, Franklin, Gilmer, Gordon, Habersham, Hall, Haralson, Hart, Lumpkin, Murray, Paulding, Pickens, Polk, Rabun, Stephens, Towns, Union, Walker, White, Whitfield\\n\\nBlack Belt Compared with the state overall, the voting population here … Has an average share of people living in cities .\\n\\nof people living in cities .

(Lauren Tierney/The Washington Post) ([object Object]) Georgia, as with much of the Deep South, was built on the backs of enslaved Black people, and the legacy of the cotton trade stretches across the middle of the state. Fifteen counties in the region have majority-Black populations and have voted reliably for Democrats even as Whiter counties have shifted toward the GOP. They’re essential to Biden’s chances in the state, but no nominee has maximized turnout here since Barack Obama’s two campaigns. From 2012 to 2016, the falloff was worth around 25,000 votes. The region’s biggest cities, Augusta, Columbus and Macon, got bluer, while Democratic margins everywhere else slightly declined. Four small counties also flipped from narrowly blue to narrowly red — Dooly, Peach, Quitman, Twiggs — as Black turnout declined, and they stayed red in 2018, even as Democratic turnout grew in urban areas. But like the Black Belt in other parts of the South, the region is slowly losing population, capping the number of new votes either party can win. 2016 vote total Donald Trump 194,353 Hillary Clinton 235,000 2016 vote totals Donald Trump: 194,353\\n\\nHillary Clinton: 235,000 Counties included: Baker, Bibb, Burke, Calhoun, Chattahoochee, Clay, Dooly, Dougherty, Early, Glascock, Hancock, Houston, Jefferson, Lee, Macon, Marion, McDuffie, Miller, Mitchell, Muscogee, Peach, Quitman, Randolph, Richmond, Schley, Stewart, Sumter, Talbot, Taliaferro, Taylor, Terrell, Twiggs, Warren, Washington, Webster, Wilkinson\\n\\nPiedmont Compared with the state overall, the voting population here … Has a lower share of people living in cities than average .\\n\\nof people living in cities than average .

(Lauren Tierney/The Washington Post) ([object Object]) Outside of Atlanta, central Georgia is mostly rural and overwhelmingly Republican, with a few dots of blue. The University of Georgia helped make Athens one of the most liberal parts of the state, if not as liberal (or as vote-rich) as similar college towns in the Midwest and Northeast, and the places closest to Atlanta moved marginally toward the Democrats. The rest of the region is overwhelmingly White and solidly Republican, with the party gaining strength here in every election since 2010. (Obama’s 2008 bid made a few inroads here, but only in that election.) Across these 30 counties, Trump ran roughly 17,000 votes ahead of Romney; Clinton ran roughly 7,000 votes ahead of Obama. Winning here by a smaller margin, over a candidate who has not inherited all of Clinton’s problems with White working-class voters, could hurt the GOP. 2016 vote total Donald Trump 399,873 Hillary Clinton 197,567 2016 vote totals Donald Trump: 399,873\\n\\nHillary Clinton: 197,567 Counties included: Baldwin, Barrow, Butts, Carroll, Clarke, Columbia, Coweta, Crawford, Fayette, Greene, Harris, Heard, Jackson, Jasper, Jones, Lamar, Lincoln, Madison, Meriwether, Monroe, Morgan, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Pike, Putnam, Spalding, Troup, Upson, Walton, Wilkes'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump--white-men-boat-parade/2020/09/27/dcd7bdd8-fe79-11ea-8d05-9beaaa91c71f_story.html', 'Full Text': 'There were motorcycles and pickup trucks on the shore, and an antique military plane in the sky. Trump flags seemed to far outnumber American ones; at least one Confederate flag flew among them. The dozen or so men firing the cannons wore red hats embroidered with Trump’s name and praise for the president. They shouted strings of excited obscenities as they marveled at the hundreds of boats behind them.\\n\\n“There are still people coming to get into the parade!” exclaimed Shaun Bickley, 54, the barge owner who organized the parade and would later change into a black tank top with “Trump 2020” and an expletive written around an American flag-patterned skull. “Man, do you see all of these people?”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Act like we’re being fired on!” yelled Jeff Karr, 59, who dropped out of high school to join the Ohio National Guard and spent 36 years in the military, including the Army Reserve, with two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. Another volley of explosions sounded.\\n\\nBlue-collar men such as Bickley, Karr and their buddies on the barge are the core of Trump’s base of support, and their enthusiasm for the president has only deepened since they first voted for him, even as Trump has driven away some voters, especially college graduates and women. As illustrated by the masculinity-oozing boat parade, the Trump Party is largely a party of men — especially White men without college degrees and especially those over the age of 40.\\n\\nA majority of White men have long sided with Republican presidential nominees, and they voted for Trump at about the same rates as in previous years, according to exit polls — but Trump won the votes of White men without college degrees by the highest rate in at least 36 years, or as long as comparable exit polling has existed. Four years into a tumultuous presidency, these men consistently give the president his highest approval ratings, and polls show they’re happier with the economy and the direction of the country than White women or voters of color.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTheir connection with Trump is cultural and emotional as much as political, closely intertwined with their lives and identities. His enemies are their enemies, his grievances are their grievances. They live by the rules he lives by: that concepts such as White male privilege or structural racism and sexism are to be scoffed at, that the working class, Christians and Trump supporters have been victimized, that it’s okay to be moved to tears by a love for the country and its president but that liberals are crybabies and snowflakes. They pride themselves on being self-made and see Trump, whose life has been nothing like their own, as a once-in-a-lifetime leader.\\n\\nBickley, who owns two marinas and a shoreline construction company, gets frustrated by the suggestion that White men such as him were born more powerful, or with advantages.\\n\\n“There’s 8 billion of us on the planet. There’s only 780 million White people. . . . So I’m personally really tired of hearing that I’m a majority, that I’m a superpower White privilege kid,” Bickley said. “My mom and dad had nothing. . . . I have been working my whole life.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Now, here I am, 54, and I’ve got a lot of stuff. . . . Somebody says: ‘Look at all of this stuff you have, you must have been privileged.’ Oh, really? Really? I’ve been working since I was 10.”\\n\\nBickley says that while he’s now “on the top of the food chain,” he remembers the years he spent as a lowly worker, helping make other people millions of dollars. He thinks Trump has that same mentality. Trump’s strategy for winning reelection relies on finding more White men who support him but didn’t vote in 2016, as well as pulling in more votes from Black and Latino men.\\n\\n“The people who love Trump can’t be swayed by anything,” Bickley said. “If you love Trump, you’re all in. There’s nobody on the fence. You’re in.”\\n\\nThose on the barge on the Saturday before Labor Day are labeled as “White working-class men” by journalists, political strategists and university researchers — people in professions that some of these Ohio men don’t consider real work, as they define it: the sort that’s physical and might get your hands dirty. That’s the work most of them have been doing since they were children and will continue to do until they die.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMany have done well for themselves without a college diploma, and they’re living a version of the American Dream that involves owning a boat and a truck to haul it.\\n\\nBickley has deep experience organizing large events on the water. For many summers, he hosted the Sandusky Bay Barge Party, which featured live music and bikini-clad women dancing around stripper poles. Bickley likes to circulate a video compilation of women’s jiggling bodies from these parties, set to an off-color song.\\n\\nHe lost his enthusiasm for it in 2015 when his father — a Navy veteran, former police officer and Democrat — died. He started paying attention to the Republican presidential primary and gleefully watched as Trump trounced established politicians — especially former Florida governor Jeb Bush.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“So in typical Bickley fashion, I started liking Trump a lot,” he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor much of his life, Bickley was an independent, although he mostly voted for Republicans, even during the decade that he worked at a quarry and was involved with a union. He’s staunchly conservative on nearly all issues except for those related to the environment, on which he’s aligned with liberals, worried about factory pollution and the health of the nation’s waterways. This is one area where he says he hasn’t studied Trump’s record.\\n\\nBickley loves that Trump puts “America first,” especially when that offends the educated elites. He supports building a wall along the southern border and forcing immigrants who arrive legally to learn English. And he agrees with Trump “constantly backing our men and women in blue,” although he says he has had a few run-ins with law enforcement himself.\\n\\nSomeone on Facebook recently suggested that Trump hasn’t accomplished much and Bickley responded, in part: “46 days away to your absolute pain. Perhaps you could stick a red hot fork in your eye. Or better yet, cut off your little buddy in despair.”\\n\\nEven as Bickley’s businesses have prospered, he still considers himself blue-collar. He recently added an image of Trump’s profile to the window of the back seat of his white SUV, so that it looks as if he is chauffeuring the president around town.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Sometimes my wife will be like: ‘More attention? You just need more attention, Shaun?’ ” he said of his wife of 31 years.\\n\\nThere was something about Trump that transcended both political parties — which is also a big reason Karr voted for him after voting for Barack Obama in 2008 and Ron Paul in 2012.\\n\\nKarr retired from the Army a few years ago, disgusted with most politicians, military leaders, government contractors and federal workers, who he said put their pursuit of wealth and power above all else, including keeping their word. For years, he has struggled with serious digestive issues that he believes were caused by burn pits in the Middle East, and he was frustrated by Veterans Affairs doctors who seemed unable to accurately diagnose him or ease his pain.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSometimes, he said, he feels as if the United States has become a nation of victims, even when they’re not — a feeling that has become especially strong amid protests over racial inequality.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“These guys that say: ‘We didn’t get a chance,’ ” he said. “No, you didn’t take a chance.”\\n\\nKarr says that racism should not be tolerated, but that he doesn’t think the nation’s problems are as bad as the media claims. Slavery was terrible, Karr said, “but that was then and this is now, and we can’t go in a negative direction.”\\n\\nTrump and Biden have squabbled over who could best serve blue-collar workers, but Bickley and Karr rolled their eyes at the notion that Biden understands them. As they see it, Biden has spent his entire career in elective office with a generous salary, posh benefits and opportunities to become wealthy. Trump is right to call him weak, they said. Although Trump was born into a wealthy family, they see him as someone who knows how to build a business and understands the pressure of trying to make payroll.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBickley said he feels bad that Biden’s son Beau died of cancer. As a father of three, he can’t imagine the pain of losing a child. But he’s taken aback that Biden has used that pain “as a political crutch.” He assumes campaign staffers suggested doing so.\\n\\n“He should have punched them in the mouth and said: ‘No, we’re not going there. That’s painful,’ ” Bickley said.\\n\\nAmy F. Grubbe, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party for Erie County, where Sandusky is located, says her volunteers don’t even bother trying to win over the men who voted for Trump in 2016.\\n\\n“People tend to go down with the ship. . . . That hardcore group, they’re going to be flying Trump flags at their funerals 30 years from now,” said Rep. Tim Ryan (D), whose eastern Ohio district is heavily blue-collar. While Ryan said he is confident Biden will win Ohio, he has little hope of converting Trump’s strongest supporters. “They’re all in with him, and there’s no way to change their minds.”\\n\\nThe issues Trump has chosen to highlight are, like his cultural positions, attractive to his White male supporters. His focus on law and order, seen by many as a way to scare some suburban women and seniors into voting for him, has also excited and rallied the men who already love him and are willing to follow him anywhere, including into an actual battle.\\n\\n“We’ll grab my AR and head for Washington and join the police force if they think they’re going to riot and destroy Washington — not under my watch. I will die shoulder-to-shoulder with the cops,” said Karr, the veteran who has three grown sons. “There ain’t no way I am going to accept lawlessness in this country.”\\n\\nHe and Bickley say Trump is right to refuse to accept any blame for the coronavirus pandemic and the nation’s resulting economic problems. Yes, people are getting sick, they said, but they do not believe the death toll is really as high as some claim.\\n\\nBickley and Karr blame the pandemic on China and credit Trump for blocking many foreign travelers from China and other countries. Bickley says he spent thousands of dollars stocking up on food and protective gear. When Trump touted the lifesaving potential of hydroxychloroquine, Bickley ordered 90 pills online, along with a bunch of Z-Paks and some zinc pills, also touted by the president. Although federal health officials have strongly warned against using the medications to treat covid-19, especially without the oversight of doctors, Bickley is confident that they work.\\n\\n“I’m not letting anybody on my team die,” he said.\\n\\nKarr nodded and added: “He’s a friend who cares.”\\n\\n“I’m a friend who can get [stuff],” Bickley said with a laugh.\\n\\nIn July, Bickley’s 32-year-old son-in-law became sick and tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Soon his 27-year-old daughter was also sick. Bickley offered them the medication, but they declined, suggesting that it was “quack science.” The two quickly recovered, he said.\\n\\nAt the boat parade, those on the barge wore headphones or earplugs to protect their hearing against the cannon blasts, but they did not wear masks.\\n\\nTwo weeks after the parade, Bickley was invited by the Trump campaign to sit in the bleachers directly behind the president as he spoke at a rally in Swanton, Ohio, just outside of Toledo. He brought along Karr and some others and wore jeans with rhinestones on the pockets and ostrich skin boots. Because they would be in view of television cameras, the campaign asked the group to put on masks. Most of the thousands who gathered outside did not.\\n\\nAs Trump took the stage and marveled at the sprawling crowd before him, Bickley and Karr did the same. Trump assured the crowd that polls showing a tight race in Ohio were “fake,” which is exactly what Bickley and Karr have been telling people. Trump debated aloud if he should nominate a woman to the Supreme Court or a man, as he did with his first two nominations — the sort of joke that Bickley and Karr say the media always takes too seriously.\\n\\n“I don’t want to make the men too angry,” Trump said as the crowd laughed. “It will be a woman. Is that okay? I don’t want to have a problem with men.”\\n\\nTrump gave himself credit for saving millions of lives and tens of millions of jobs amid the pandemic. He promised to continue to build up the military, the power of which he said he’s not afraid to use on American soil. He told the crowd that he is “the only thing standing between you and chaos,” and he warned “suburban men and husbands” that if Biden is elected, “you’re not going to have your dream very much longer.”\\n\\nTrump left the stage to the recorded sounds of the Village People telling men everywhere that “there’s no need to feel down . . . there’s no need to be unhappy.”\\n\\nBickley said afterward that the sound system near their group wasn’t working properly, so they couldn’t always understand what Trump was saying. But they applauded anyway.\\n\\n“We could see what he saw. We could feel what he felt. We could see the laughter and the joy and the excitement,” Bickley said of their front-row seats. “So the couple times I couldn’t hear him, that was okay; I knew I was supposed to clap. I don’t know what I was clapping about, but I clapped.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/idaho-family-portland-trump-rally/2020/09/21/246ef878-f2e5-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html', 'Full Text': 'Kyzik was not well known in Republican activist circles.

As with the teenage shooting suspect in Kenosha, Wis., and the black-clad protesters in Portland, street-level confrontations have become defining moments in the era of viral politics, at times eclipsing the official activities of Trump and his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden.\\n\\nKuzmenko, who declined to comment at length for this story, has said publicly that it was not his intention for cruise participants to confront protesters directly, or for the caravan to end in violence. The goal, his family members said in interviews, was simply to show support for the president.\\n\\nBut coverage of the caravan took on a life of its own, becoming fodder for conspiracy and propaganda outlets. The Epoch Times, a pro-Trump publication sympathetic to the Falun Gong spiritual movement critical of the Chinese government, featured Kuzmenko, referring to him by his alternate name, in its live coverage of the event on social media.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“MAGA is heading into Portland,” right-wing provocateur Jack Posobiec, a correspondent for the pro-Trump One America News, wrote on Twitter. The tweet was shared the next morning by Trump, who added, “GREAT PATRIOTS!”\\n\\nVideo of the cruise rally and its chaotic entry into downtown Portland was also promoted by the Kremlin-financed RT, along with lesser-known U.S.-based outlets seeking to improve relations with Moscow.\\n\\n“Oregonians tired of riots organized a mass car rally in support of Donald Trump,” read the Russian caption on the video shared across Facebook by “The Russian American,” the media arm of a Seattle-based nongovernmental organization advocating improved ties with Moscow. No one from the group, the Russian-American Cooperation Initiative, took part in the caravan, said its director, Sergey Gladysh, declining to elaborate on why they had nonetheless amplified video of the event on social media.\\n\\nLocal GOP officials and activists said Kuzmenko and his relatives were strangers to them until they began organizing pro-Trump caravans this summer, first in Boise, where two occurred in July and August, and ultimately in Portland. “I attended one,” said Victor B. Miller IV, chairman of the Ada County Republican Central Committee in Idaho, declining to comment further.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCin Alfonso, co-founder of the Idaho Liberty Dogs, a pro-Trump group that has sent armed civilians to monitor Black Lives Matter protests, had not heard of Kuzmenko before his cruise rallies this summer. “Alex just popped up one day,” Alfonso said.\\n\\nTrump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said that the campaign has had “no contact” with Kuzmenko and that it did not provide any Trump merchandise for the cruise rallies.\\n\\nKuzmenko and his family said they organized the Portland rally because of their enthusiastic support for Trump as well as concern about months of unrest there. “Nobody’s paying us to do any of this,” said one brother, Nikolay Kuzmenko. Another brother, Dennis Kuzmenko, said, “We wanted it to be organic.” Oleg Volkov, a Portland-based associate of the family who recorded video from the scene of the caravan, said he was “not affiliated with any groups or anything like that,” declining to comment further.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDespite the focus on the bloodshed in Portland, including in a volley of tweets from the president the morning after the Aug. 29 episode, little is known about the personalities who set the events in motion.\\n\\nWhen approached at a church in Meridian run by a relative, Alex Kuzmenko said his political activities were personal, insisting, “I’m not a public figure.”\\n\\nNikolay Kuzmenko said the hosts did not reveal their full names because they feared backlash from antifa, a loose collection of left-wing activists Trump has made a focal point of his reelection campaign.\\n\\nAlex Kuzmenko and most of the other rally organizers are members of an extended family that came to the United States in 1993 from near Chernobyl, Ukraine, multiple family members said. Alex Kuzmenko’s mother, Lyubov, said she is originally from Belarus.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn an interview outside her blue farmhouse in Nampa, Idaho, Lyubov Kuzmenko and her son Dennis traced their embrace of Trump to the family’s difficulties living under the Soviet system. They said the family suffered religious persecution because of their evangelical Christian beliefs and that relatives who stayed in Belarus have had little opportunity to prosper.\\n\\n“Communism. That’s what we got away from,” said Dennis, 24, who owns a local heating and cooling company. “Trump is all about religious freedom and letting people serve their own God. And we’re behind that.”\\n\\nThe family first settled in Portland and then relocated to Meridian in 2006, the 24-year-old and his mother said. They chose to settle in Idaho’s Treasure Valley because of the family atmosphere and access to the outdoors, Lyubov Kuzmenko said. She and her relatives make up about half the congregation at the Fountain of Life Church, a local evangelical congregation that is led by a relative and holds services in Russian.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAlex Kuzmenko is listed as the director of a real estate company that advertises the opportunity to “Sell Your House For Fast Cash.” He and his wife, Lily, have run a wedding photography business. Several family members are listed as officers of freight shipping and trucking businesses, according to corporate records.\\n\\nDennis Kuzmenko said he and Alex conceived of hosting Trump rallies in Boise and Portland to fill a campaign void.\\n\\n“There’s no Trump rallies going on. There’s nothing going on. Everyone’s just hiding out,” he said. “We wanted people to get out there.”\\n\\nHe added: “It was just fun for us.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAlmost all of the rally’s hosts used pseudonyms or variations of their names to host the Portland event on Facebook. Nikolay, who appears to operate multiple Facebook accounts, goes by Nik Kuz. Nikolay’s wife, Yuliya Kuzmenko, goes by Julie Kuz. Another host, Tina Berezhnoy, shortened her name to Tina Bere. Neither woman responded to requests for comment.\\n\\nThe Kuzmenko family has little documented history of political activism. Alex Kuzmenko voted in 2016 but in no other American election, records indicate. His brother Dennis, who said he is the only family member born in the United States, is also the only member of the Idaho family to make a contribution to a political committee, according to the Federal Election Commission database. It shows he gave $60 to a pro-Trump group and other Republican causes last year.\\n\\nA Facebook co-host for Alex Kuzmenko’s first rally, Bonnie Isbill Dodson, said she had never met Kuzmenko or attended any of his rallies, including the one she co-hosted. The Meridian resident said she had been scrolling through items on Facebook Marketplace when she came across the invitation for the July rally in Boise and was alarmed by a string of offensive comments. When she contacted Kuzmenko, he asked her to monitor the posts. The next thing she knew, she said, she was listed as a co-organizer on the event page.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKuzmenko publicly distanced himself from a subsequent Portland caravan, writing on Facebook: “Given all the circumstances and investigations going on, we would like to be VERY CLEAR that the Labor Day Portland Rally is NOT organized by us. Such events take time to organize and everything that is organized rapidly is simply NOT SAFE.”\\n\\nHe added, “Based on our law enforcement contacts, they highly discourage any rally from happening so soon after the first one.”\\n\\nKuzmenko has already tired of political activism, his family insists. “He wants out,” Dennis Kuzmenko said of his brother’s organizing efforts. “He wants someone else to take over.”\\n\\nHe continues to promote his past events, however. After warning against new rallies, he returned to his Facebook event page, which is followed by nearly 11,000 users, to draw attention to a highly produced video of the rally he had organized in Portland, highlighting the flag-waving spectacle before the street-level brawls began. “The rally video is done, please like and share with friends and family,” he wrote on Sept. 5.\\n\\nThe video has been viewed about 150,000 times, drawing considerable attention to his YouTube channel, called “Open N Review,” which was devoted to luxury vehicles for two years before a sudden shift to pro-Trump politics this summer. His videos used to average about 10,000 views. Now he is topping 100,000, and a YouTube spokeswoman, Charlotte Smith, confirmed that his channel is earning revenue from ads appearing on his videos.\\n\\nMost of the video’s engagement on Facebook, according to data from the analysis tool CrowdTangle, came from a post in a group called “Pray for Our President” by an account called “Nozul Olyvia,” its profile picture an image of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Facebook removed the account following questions from The Washington Post. It was not clear who was behind the account, with a Facebook spokeswoman, Sarah Pollack, saying only that it violated the company’s policy on authenticity.\\n\\nIn drumming up online interest in the rallies, Kuzmenko and his family showed considerable sophistication on social media, including hiring a Boise-based video company to polish his presentation, according to the head of the company, Bryan Bowermaster. Kuzmenko’s first action on the event page was provocative — sharing a Facebook post from the president that included a video showing him running for office indefinitely, with signs reading “Trump 2024” and on into the future. The same message was later echoed at the August rally in Portland, with chants of “12 more years, not just four!”\\n\\n“We call all patriots and God-loving Americans to stop waiting for a change, but be the change in your country by praying and voting, in person, this November,” Kuzmenko said, reading from notes into a megaphone at the rally.\\n\\nIn the weeks leading up to the Portland cruise, he and his relatives also posted repeatedly about opportunities to purchase flags and other gear for the event. American flags and Trump flags went for $5 to $15, while the price for “thin blue line” flags was $10, according to screenshots of their various advertising announcements on social media. Kuzmenko’s sister-in-law, who goes by Julie on Facebook, offered “CUSTOM MADE” hitch mounts, capable of holding up to three flags, at $60 apiece.\\n\\nThe caravan route was apparently intended to avoid downtown Portland, the site of months of nightly and often violent clashes between law enforcement and protesters. But some participants drove there anyway, firing pepper spray and paintball guns.\\n\\n“The shooting was not part of the event. It was not part of the cruise rally,” Kuzmenko said in a video, accusing antifa of funneling people downtown.\\n\\nIn a three-hour video of the early phase of the cruise rally, uploaded to Kuzmenko’s YouTube channel, a woman who appears to be holding the camera says at one point, “We’re going to head over to downtown Portland.”\\n\\nAt another point, the woman behind the camera — who switches seamlessly between English and Ukrainian — seeks to stage Internet-ready enthusiasm, asking a rallygoer standing before a crowd to begin a chant: “Can you walk up and down the line, like, ‘USA?’ ”\\n\\nCORRECTION: This article has been updated to correct the partisan makeup of Boise. Although the city leans liberal, and mainly elects Democrats to the state legislature, the greatest number of voters are unaffiliated.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/24/why-arguments-that-mail-in-balloting-will-undermine-election-are-wrong/', 'Full Text': 'It\\'s also almost entirely nonsense, generated from a combination of misunderstanding, old false arguments and new political motivations.\\n\\nLet’s assess each point independently.\\n\\nVery few states are sending out ballots without requests.\\n\\nA centerpiece of President Trump’s rhetoric on this point is his assertion that states are sending out ballots willy-nilly to anyone who has ever filled out a voter registration form.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“This is being done on purpose. They know it’s no good,” Trump said last week. “They know it’s — it’s going to be fraudulent. It’s going to be fraud all over the place. Who’s getting the ballots? Who’s sending the ballots? They have people saying you don’t need a verified signature. This is a serious threat to our democracy, and the Democrats know that.”\\n\\nHe often contrasts this strategy of ensuring voters have ballots to complete with a more traditional absentee ballot process, something he uses and for which he has publicly advocated.\\n\\nThat\\'s also exactly what most states are doing.\\n\\nAs of writing, there are 10 places in which voters will be sent a ballot by mail, the thing Trump rails against. Five did so before the coronavirus pandemic: Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington. Five began doing so this year: California, D.C., Nevada, New Jersey and Vermont.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYou’ve probably noticed that there aren’t many swing states among those 10. Nevada is the only state in which the contest might be close and that is sending out ballots. Nevada is also the focus of Trump’s “you don’t need a verified signature” assertion, which we’ll get to in a bit, but it’s worth noting that this is not true.\\n\\nAmong the seven states that were closest in 2016, two besides Nevada made changes. New Hampshire introduced voting by mail, although with an application. Wisconsin will send absentee-ballot applications to every voter.\\n\\nIn total, 51 million voters will receive a ballot in the mail, according to a Washington Post analysis. About half of those are in California and Washington state, both places that Trump has no shot of winning.\\n\\nThere’s almost no fraud in American elections — and no reason to think this year will be different.\\n\\nIt has been fascinating to watch how Trump’s focus on fraud has shifted over the past four years. Before 2016, he warned that fraudulent voting would occur at polling places in Pennsylvania. Then, when he won Pennsylvania, he began claiming that his popular-vote loss was a result of fraud at a truly staggering scale, the sort of thing that might seem detectable. Then, as states began expanding voting by mail, given the coronavirus pandemic, he turned his attention to those mail ballots.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn no case has Trump’s rhetoric matched reality. There’s no more significant threat of rampant voter fraud from those mail ballots than there was from people voting multiple times in Philadelphia or from millions of immigrants voting in California — all claims he has made. Each has been specifically tailored not to reality but to the political point he wants to make.\\n\\nTrump and his allies will often allege widespread voter fraud by pointing to things that might, in theory, be used to commit fraud. A lot has been made, for example, of people encountering batches of ballots intended for voters who had moved or died. But there is a wide gap between “having the ability to cast a ballot fraudulently” and “casting a ballot fraudulently,” a gap that necessitates, among other things, violating state or federal law. There’s a wider gap still between casting a ballot and “having that ballot be accepted as legitimate.”\\n\\n(We made a quiz illustrating this point.)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe amount of fraud in recent American elections has been de minimis. Sure, dubious things happened in 1960, but this isn\\'t 1960. And, sure, dubious things happen, but rarely at any significant scale and at no recent point at a national one.\\n\\nYou will hear assertions to the contrary. You will hear, for example, that former president Jimmy Carter co-chaired a commission that determined that mail-in voting was risky. In fact, the commission wrote that voting by mail was “fraught with risk,” a determination based on a report from another organization. It was also 15 years ago, before mail-in voting was broadly expanded and additional checks added to the process. A Post analysis looked at nearly 15 million votes cast by mail in 2016 and 2018, and it found fewer than 400 possible cases of double voting or a vote cast for a dead person. If each of those cases was, in fact, intentional fraud — which hasn’t been determined — it’s equivalent to having $10,000 in the bank and seeing someone purloin a quarter. (It’s also worth pointing out that Carter endorsed voting by mail this year.)\\n\\nThat qualifier that fraud hasn’t been proven in those 400-odd cases is important because it’s common for broad allegations of fraud to be made that collapse upon further scrutiny. A report from Texas last year, for example, claimed that tens of thousands of noncitizens had voted in the state, a claim Trump quickly elevated. But it wasn’t true, ignoring that many of those voters had become citizens before they voted. A review subsequently found only 80 instances in which people might potentially have cast improper votes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere have been situations in which systematic fraud has occurred. In 2018, a campaign consultant allegedly coordinated a system of collecting and filling out ballots on behalf of voters in North Carolina. The election results were thrown out, despite the level of fraud not being sufficient to affect the results. It was a Republican campaign for which the alleged fraud was committed; a Republican ended up winning the new election.\\n\\nTrump talks less about that example than Paterson, N.J. There, evidence of fraud was detected in a local election and charges were filed against a (Democratic) candidate and two campaign workers.\\n\\nAn important point in both of those cases is that the fraud was detected. Efforts to affect an election are rare, but, in two cases in which people tried it, it was uncovered in short order. Trump has repeatedly suggested that the number of rejected ballots in Paterson is itself a signifier of fraud, but the point is entirely that efforts to commit fraud have to overcome robust checks designed to detect it. Local officials may, in fact, be overzealous about tossing ballots out of concern about fraud, something that promises to be a focus of legal fights after this year’s contest.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThose checks are a reason some of Trump’s wilder scenarios, such as an election flooded with ballots sent by foreign actors, don’t make much sense. How, for example, are Russian agents going to slip millions of ballots into the mail undetected? More critically, how are they going to mimic voter signatures in a way that passes detection upon scrutiny? (A forgery expert with whom The Post spoke called this scenario “highly unlikely.” On Thursday, FBI Director Christopher Wray called it “a major challenge” for an adversary to undertake successfully.)\\n\\nWere this the sort of election that takes place in a fourth-grade classroom, where kids check boxes on a slip of paper and drop it in a ballot box, fraud would be easy. But, happily, the nation’s process for voting is a bit more sophisticated than that — and the dearth of demonstrated fraud reinforces that.\\n\\nIt’s worth noting, too, that Trump’s claims of fraud are vague enough to be inconsistent. At a rally in Pennsylvania this week, he reverted to his 2016 allegations that people would vote illegally at polling places.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“If you see somebody cheating, you’ve got to turn them in,” Trump said. “And you probably will. It’s going to be a mess.\"\\n\\nActually, you almost certainly won’t. But Trump probably would be content with his supporters accosting those they thought shouldn’t be voting on Nov. 3.\\n\\nIt has been common in recent years for ballots counted after Election Day to favor Democrats — for predictable reasons.\\n\\nThe prospect of vast numbers of mail-in ballots arriving on — or, in some states, after — Election Day has prompted Trump and his allies to suggest that this is part of an effort to throw the election to his opponents. Again, this is almost entirely predicated on the idea that those votes are subject to rampant fraud, something that is itself unfounded.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut it\\'s theoretically bolstered by the demonstrable fact that votes counted after Election Day tend to favor Democrats. If your theory is that Democrats cheat and will cheat using mail-in ballots, a Democrat-friendly post-election tally seems to reinforce your point.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn reality, though, this has been a common phenomenon in recent years. In 2016, for example, Trump and Hillary Clinton were running about even in the popular vote on Election Day. It was only the post-election tally, particularly in California, that gave Clinton her broad popular-vote lead.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, this vote tends to be more Democratic for a number of reasons. One is that more voters means more ballots to count, and big, urban counties tend to have more voters — and more Democrats. Another is that voters who vote less frequently (meaning that they are more likely to require a provisional ballot) or those who register to vote on Election Day tend to align with Democratic constituencies: non-White voters and younger voters in particular.\\n\\nThis year, though, that partisan gap will be much broader. Democrats have been consistently more likely than Republicans to say in polling that they plan to vote by mail. On Wednesday, for example, Quinnipiac University released a poll showing that about a third of the electorate plans to vote by mail — and that group prefers former vice president Joe Biden over Trump by 42 points. Among the half of respondents who plan to vote in person on Election Day, Trump leads by 22 points.\\n\\nThe result is what has been called the “blue shift” — results moving more in the Democrats’ favor after Election Day. Trump has repeatedly suggested that this is some nefarious change, as he did when California’s votes in 2018 shifted control of the House to the Democrats by a wider margin, or as he did when Florida’s close Senate race couldn’t be called for the Republican candidate immediately. He should have learned about the “blue shift” in 2012, though, after his wild assertions on election night, when he mistakenly thought that Mitt Romney had beaten Barack Obama in the popular vote.\\n\\nWhat this means, though, is that the results of the election as they stand on Nov. 3 will almost certainly not reflect the actual vote. Earlier this month, we created an interactive graphic to show how post-Nov. 3 vote-counting could shift our understanding of who won each state.\\n\\nWhat percentage of votes will be cast by mail?\\n\\nDemocratic voters 49%\\n\\nRepublican voters 21% What percentage of ballots will be rejected?\\n\\n10% How long will it take to count all the ballots?\\n\\n14 days What will be the shift in the popular vote from 2016?\\n\\nDem +5 Your browser cannot display this graph. Your browser cannot display this graph. Your browser cannot display this graph.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t a function of fraud and scheming. It\\'s a function of counting votes, and a predictable one.\\n\\nThis may be a problem that could have been ameliorated.\\n\\nThe reason Democrats are so much more likely to vote by mail is simple: Democrats are much more likely to express concern about contracting the coronavirus. The effort to shift states to expand voting by mail wasn’t a function of building systems to commit fraud but, instead, to give voters an opportunity to vote while still maintaining a safe distance from other people.\\n\\nMany of these efforts to foster more mail-in voting were initiated earlier in the year, when both medical and political experts were scrambling to determine how best to conduct an election while a highly contagious virus is circulating. Over time, we’ve learned how we might effectively manage an in-person election, with even the country’s top infectious-disease expert, Anthony S. Fauci, endorsing the idea — given sufficient protective measures.\\n\\nVoting in person remains riskier than voting from home, obviously, but assuming the use of masks and social distancing, the risk of voting at a polling place is relatively low. This is particularly true if early voting is available, allowing voters to better avoid interacting with other people.\\n\\nIt’s likely, though, that this ship has sailed. We can expect a combination of factors that will lead to more votes being cast by mail and counted in the days after the election and that those votes will be more heavily Democratic. We can further expect that this will be cited as evidence of fraud by a president eager to prevent those votes from being tallied.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/ice-air-farmville-protests-covid/2020/09/11/f70ebe1e-e861-11ea-bc79-834454439a44_story.html', 'Full Text': 'U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said the agency moved the detainees on “ICE Air” charter flights to avoid overcrowding at detention facilities in Arizona and Florida, a precaution they said was taken because of the pandemic.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut a Department of Homeland Security official with direct knowledge of the operation, and a former ICE official who learned about it from other personnel, said the primary reason for the June 2 transfers was to skirt rules that bar ICE employees from traveling on the charter flights unless detainees are also aboard.\\n\\n\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe transfers took place over the objections of ICE officials in the Washington field office, according to testimony at a Farmville town council meeting in August, and at a time when immigration jails elsewhere in the country had plenty of beds available because of a dramatic decrease in border crossings and in-country arrests.\\n\\n“They needed to justify the movement of SRT,” said the DHS official, referring to the special response teams. The official and the former ICE official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal decisions. They and another DHS official briefed on the operation characterized the tactical teams’ travel on ICE Air as a misuse of the charter flights.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt a hearing in a federal lawsuit filed on behalf of four detainees who were already at Farmville, an ICE attorney told a judge that one reason for the transfer was that “ICE has an air regulation whereby in order to move agents of ICE, they have to be moved from one location to another with detainees on the same airplane.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, focuses on the exposure to the coronavirus for the detainees, three of whom contracted the infection.\\n\\nAsked about the primary purpose of the charter flights, ICE officials said the goal was to move detainees into facilities with more space for social distancing.\\n\\n“ICE transfers detainees due to the operational demands of the detention network. The June 2 transfer of detainees to Farmville was made as part of a national effort to spread detainees across the detention network to facilitate social distancing and mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” Henry Lucero, who oversees ICE enforcement operations, said in a statement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nICE statistics show the facilities the detainees came from were not near capacity on June 1, when the transfers were arranged. CCA Florence, a jail in Arizona with beds for roughly 550 detainees, was about 35 percent full that day, records show. The facility that appeared most crowded, Eloy Detention Center in Arizona, was about 70 percent full. Farmville was 57 percent full, according to ICE.\\n\\n“During COVID-19, the agency has taken steps to protect detainees in its custody and promote social distancing whenever possible,” spokeswoman Danielle Bennett said in a separate statement. “This has resulted in the transfer of detainees from facilities with larger detention populations to facilities with fewer detainees. This was the reason for the transfers to Farmville.”\\n\\nICE officials did not respond to requests for examples of other detainee transfers this year from Arizona or Florida to Farmville, which is the agency’s closest major facility to Washington.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut publicly available flight data show the June 2 flights were highly unusual. There is no other record this year of ICE transferring detainees from Phoenix to Virginia or Miami to Virginia, according to records compiled by Witness at the Border, an immigrant advocacy group that monitors ICE Air activity.\\n\\nOn June 1, after two nights of mass protests outside the White House, a top DHS official said in a memo obtained by The Washington Post that special response teams were being sent to the District from Arizona, Florida and Texas, with plans to arrive the following day.\\n\\nThe move was part of a wider deployment of Border Patrol agents, U.S. Marshals, ICE tactical teams and other federal forces in downtown Washington and around the White House. ICE teams stationed closer to the nation’s capital were already in place at the protests; the additional units were flown in as reinforcements, U.S. officials said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe teams were not responsible for guarding detainees on the flights, a role handled by private contractors and ICE enforcement officers.\\n\\nLucero was a key player in the decision to move the heavily armed teams on ICE Air flights, three officials said. He formerly ran the agency’s Phoenix field office, and has a close relationship to the Phoenix tactical officers, who are considered among the agency’s best-trained, the officials said.\\n\\nThe special response teams, based in several ICE field offices, are typically used to control riots in detention facilities, among other duties. They usually deploy locally, using ground transport. In cases where they have to fly, the teams normally use commercial airlines, which can be expensive and inconvenient because of the weapons and equipment the agents travel with.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe use of the teams was part of the Trump administration’s effort to “dominate” racial equity demonstrations nationwide. ICE special-response teams deployed to civil unrest and protests this summer in Washington, Buffalo, New York, Houston, Dallas, San Diego, San Francisco and Los Angeles, according to a GAO report published Thursday. More recently, federal agents have been sent to Kenosha, Wis., and Portland, Ore.\\n\\nD.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) did not request special-response teams to deal with protests in the nation’s capital, which were generally peaceful. City officials have criticized the federal response to the demonstrations — including the decision to have police in riot gear forcefully scatter a crowd to clear the way for a photo op by President Trump on June 1 in front of St. John’s Church near the White House — as excessive overreach.\\n\\nThe June 2 deployment to the District took place amid heightened concerns that immigration detention centers and prisons had become deadly incubators for covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. There had been 5,670 cases of the virus reported inside ICE facilities as of Thursday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nICE says it has expanded safeguards inside all its facilities — including pre-transfer medical screenings and temperature checks, and quarantining new transfers before they’re moved in with the general population.\\n\\nThe detainees sent to Farmville were kept apart from the rest of the detainee population for 14 days, Bennett said. But at the end of that period, the number of cases at the facility exploded, with 339 inmates having tested positive by early July. That was more cases reported than at any other immigration jail until early this month, when officials said there were 366 at La Palma Correctional Center in Arizona.\\n\\nTypically on ICE Air flights, agency personnel and detainees sit in different sections of the plane. ICE has said no agents who traveled on the planes appear to have been infected.\\n\\nLast month, the director of Immigration Centers of America (ICA), the company that operates the Farmville detention center, said local ICE officials resisted the plan to transfer the 74 detainees into his facility because there wasn’t enough room to properly quarantine them at a county jail about 100 miles away that is normally reserved for that purpose.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“This transfer that took place on June 2 was ordered by ICE headquarters,” Jeffrey Crawford, the director, told Farmville’s town council on Aug. 12. “I do know that the local field office pushed back and attempted to refuse the transfer, and they were overridden by officials in Washington.”\\n\\nCrawford said ICE officials told him that the arriving detainees were not sick. In an affidavit filed in connection with the lawsuit, which names Crawford, ICA, ICE and government officials as defendants, he said one detainee arrived with symptoms of covid-19 and tested positive. The rest of the group was then tested; 51 had the virus, according to the affidavit.\\n\\n“We were assured before they came that these folks were healthy,” Crawford told the town council, according to a video recording of the meeting. “We were told that one of the facilities where the detainees were coming from had no instances of covid-19. In hindsight, we believe we’ve discovered information that that is not accurate. But that is what we were told at the time.”\\n\\nCrawford did not respond to a request for comment made through his attorney.\\n\\nHundreds more detainees eventually tested positive, including James Thomas Hill, 72, a Canadian national who was not part of the transfer group. Hill died on Aug. 5, several weeks after being hospitalized with covid-19.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe outbreak sparked concerns that the virus would spread into the surrounding community and prompted state officials to ask the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to intervene.\\n\\nAn attorney representing some of the detainees in the federal lawsuit called the possibility that ICE transported immigrants in its custody as a means to respond to protests in Washington “chilling.”\\n\\n“It was in June, when it was already perfectly clear — including in CDC guidelines — that transfers are risky and should only be undertaken when absolutely necessary,” said Sirine Shebaya, a lawyer with the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild.\\n\\nThe number of detainees in ICE custody has decreased significantly during the pandemic, the result of fewer interior arrests and emergency expulsion policies at the border. The average daily detainee population was 24,208 in June, ICE statistics show, compared with 39,319 in February.\\n\\nLast month, a CDC inspection found that some of Farmville’s staff members were still not properly wearing protective masks, while others continued working after showing symptoms of covid-19.\\n\\nThat prompted U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema, who is overseeing the lawsuit, to order a new health inspection at the site. Two reports from that Aug. 20 inspection — one for each side in the lawsuit — showed that physical distancing measures had been implemented.\\n\\nBut a health expert for the defendants found some detainees were not wearing the masks they’d been given, while the plaintiffs’ expert found that at least eight detainees who had tested positive for the virus still had symptoms after being released from isolation.\\n\\nDuring an Aug. 11 hearing, Yuri S. Fuchs, an ICE lawyer, told Brinkema the reason for the June 2 transfer was “twofold.”\\n\\nFirst, ICE has a policy of shifting detainees between facilities to prevent overcrowding, Fuchs said. The second reason, he told the judge, was the federal requirement to have detainees aboard any ICE Air flights used to transport agents.\\n\\n“I’m sorry, explain that second one to me,” Brinkema said.\\n\\n“That’s an ICE Air regulation that requires detainees and staff to be on the same flight, so they’re being moved around,” Fuchs said.\\n\\n“I think what you’re saying then is when you move inmates, or detainees, you have to have ICE people with them,” Brinkema said. “That’s got to be what that means.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/11/trumps-fusillade-falsehoods-mail-voting/', 'Full Text': 'A mountain of evidence shows that mail voting has been almost entirely free of fraud through the decades, but Trump insists that it’s a recipe for disaster.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThese warnings about vote-by-mail are almost identical to the disinformation Russia is spreading to undermine confidence in the U.S. presidential election. “Since March 2020, Russian state media and proxy websites have denigrated vote-by-mail processes, alleging they lack transparency and procedural oversight, creating vast opportunities for voter fraud,” according to a Department of Homeland Security intelligence bulletin.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nElection experts say that mail voting is slightly more vulnerable to fraud than voting in person but that both methods are trustworthy because of the safety measures state officials use to verify ballots.\\n\\n“The truth is that after decades of looking for illegal voting, there’s no proof of widespread fraud,” Benjamin L. Ginsberg, a leading Republican elections lawyer who retired last month, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed Sept. 8. “At most, there are isolated incidents — by both Democrats and Republicans. Elections are not rigged.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome GOP strategists reportedly are worried Trump’s claims could boomerang on Republicans by depressing their voters’ participation. But it’s not just Trump. Attorney General William P. Barr and Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel have repeated these falsehoods.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee, in its report about Russian election disinformation, recommended: “Sitting officials and candidates should use the absolute greatest amount of restraint and caution if they are considering publicly calling the validity of an upcoming election into question. Such a grave allegation can have significant national security and electoral consequences, including limiting the response options of the appropriate authorities, and exacerbating the already damaging messaging efforts of foreign intelligence services.”\\n\\nHere’s a guide to the most outlandish claims from Trump and his allies. We’ve fact-checked them before, handing out numerous Pinocchios, but Trump and his allies keep repeating these falsehoods over and over. So caveat emptor, there is no excuse for believing anything the president says on this issue.\\n\\nMail voting is riddled with fraud\\n\\n“Mail-In Ballots will lead to massive electoral fraud and a rigged 2020 Election. Look at all of the cases and examples that are out there right now.” (Trump tweet, July 2)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Elections that have been held with mail have found substantial fraud and coercion.” (Barr interview on CNN, Sept. 2)\\n\\nThis is the key falsehood in Trump’s arsenal. But the evidence boils down to peanuts.\\n\\n“There is, of course, evidence of some absentee ballot fraud, just as there is for in-person fraud, although in both cases it is quite minimal — a handful out of hundreds of millions of votes cast over the last two decades,” said Richard Briffault, a professor and elections expert at Columbia Law School.\\n\\nFive states — Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington — use mail ballots as the primary method of voting. In 2018, more than 31 million Americans voted by mail, representing one-quarter of election participants, according to the National Vote at Home Institute.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Despite this dramatic increase in mail voting over time, fraud rates remain infinitesimally small,” according to the Brennan Center for Justice. “None of the five states that hold their elections primarily by mail has had any voter fraud scandals since making that change.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA Washington Post analysis of data collected by three vote-by-mail states with help from the nonprofit Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) found that officials identified 372 possible cases of double voting or voting on behalf of deceased people out of about 14.6 million votes cast by mail in the 2016 and 2018 general elections, or 0.0025 percent.\\n\\nAnother analysis over a longer period also found a very low rate of fraud. “There were 491 prosecutions related to absentee ballots in all elections nationwide between 2000 and 2012, out of literally billions of ballots cast,” Richard L. Hasen, an elections expert at the University of California at Irvine, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump established a presidential commission to investigate voter fraud in 2017, but it disbanded without finding any. A database maintained by the conservative Heritage Foundation, Ginsberg wrote in his op-ed, “has compiled every instance of any kind of voter fraud it could find since 1982. It contains 1,296 incidents, a minuscule percentage of the votes cast.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn his CNN interview, Barr falsely said a man was indicted in Texas for collecting “1,700 ballots … from people who could vote, he made them out and voted for the person he wanted to.” A single ballot was proven fraudulent in that case — and it was caught. A spokeswoman for Barr said he relied on a memo that contained an “inaccurate summary” of the Texas case, but the attorney general did not back down from his claim about “substantial fraud and coercion” in mail voting.\\n\\nForeign powers could spoof mail ballots\\n\\n“You go to foreign countries — you know, they keep talking, ‘Oh, Russia and China and this.‘ Especially China, not Russia. Especially China. Are they going to print millions of ballots using the exact same paper, using the exact same machines? And are they going print ballots and then hand them in? And then, all of a sudden — it’s the biggest risk we have.” (Trump interview on “Hannity,” June 25)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Foreign countries, they’re going to be printing their own ballots. … They’re going to take them out of the mailboxes. They’re going to take them from postmen. They’re going to print them fraudulently and foreign countries are going to print them.” (Trump interview, June 22)\\n\\n“RIGGED 2020 ELECTION: MILLIONS OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS WILL BE PRINTED BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND OTHERS. IT WILL BE THE SCANDAL OF OUR TIMES!” (Trump tweet, June 22)\\n\\n“I’m saying people are concerned about foreign influence, and if we use a ballot system with a system that some — that states are just now in trying to adopt, it does leave open the possibility of counterfeiting, counterfeiting ballots either by someone here or someone overseas.” (Barr interview on CNN, Sept. 2)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt’s not as simple as printing and mailing. Experts say it would be almost impossible to successfully counterfeit the ballots being prepared for November’s general election.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nState election officials use multiple safeguards to verify that mail ballots are authentic. Most states have bar codes printed on their mail ballots. When a completed ballot arrives, election officials scan the bar code to link it with the corresponding voter in the system. Duplicate ballots from the same voter wouldn’t be recognized by the system.\\n\\nIn addition, voters must follow specific instructions to return a ballot received in the mail, such as signing an affidavit. Officials typically compare the signature on the ballot with the one in the registration and may discard ballots with mismatched signatures.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor a granular look, NPR interviewed Jennifer Morrell, an elections consultant and former election official in Utah and Colorado. “Ballots are built unique for each election,” she said. “Each jurisdiction will normally have dozens to hundreds of unique ballot styles. Proofs for each ballot style are reviewed and tested to ensure the ballot scanners will read those ballots and only those ballots. Even ballots created on that system from a previous election cannot be read.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDozens of graphical details, candidate names, official seals, check boxes and bar codes would have to be copied perfectly, on dozens of different ballot designs — and that’s for each jurisdiction in the United States. On top of that, the hypothetical foreign nation would have to identify registered voters (who had not already voted by mail) and somehow forge their signatures.\\n\\n“What would be the point of a counterfeit ballot if it will be counted only if it comes from a real voter?” Briffault said. “I don’t see how a counterfeit ballot gets around the voter verification process.”\\n\\nVoting twice\\n\\n“Let them send it in and let them go vote, and if their system’s as good as they say it is, then obviously they won’t be able to vote. If it isn’t tabulated, they’ll be able to vote. So that’s the way it is, and that’s what they should do.” (Trump interview in North Carolina, Sept. 2)\\n\\n“So send it in early and then go and vote. You can’t let them take your vote away; these people are playing dirty politics. So if you have an absentee ballot … you send it in, but I’d check it, follow it and go vote.” (Trump to supporters in Wilmington, N.C., Sept. 2)\\n\\nIt’s illegal to vote more than once in an election, and in some states, it’s a felony. In response to Trump’s comments, Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, issued a statement noting that “attempting to vote twice in an election or soliciting someone to do so also is a violation of North Carolina law.”\\n\\nTrump then tweeted that voters should “go to your Polling Place to see whether or not your Mail In Vote has been Tabulated (Counted). … If it has not been Counted, VOTE (which is a citizen’s right to do).”\\n\\nNorth Carolina voters may check the status of their mail ballots online or by contacting local officials, as is the case in other states. “The State Board office strongly discourages people from showing up at the polls on Election Day to check whether their absentee ballot was counted. That is not necessary, and it would lead to longer lines and the possibility of spreading COVID-19,” Brinson Bell said.\\n\\nAt a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Sept. 3, Trump doubled down on his comments. “These mail-in ballots are a disgrace and they know it,” he said. “Sign your mail-in ballot. Sign it and send it in and then you have to follow it. And if on Election Day or early voting, that is not tabulated and counted, you go vote.”\\n\\n20 percent voter fraud in a New Jersey city\\n\\n“So much time is taken talking about foreign influence, but the same people won’t even discuss Mail-In election corruption. Look at Patterson, N.J. 20% of vote was corrupted!” (Trump tweet, July 26)\\n\\nTrump often points to Paterson, N.J., where a special election was held for several city council seats May 12. As part of its coronavirus response, New Jersey held all-mail elections for the first time that day. The state attorney general later announced that a sitting councilman, a former councilman and two others (all Democrats) had been charged with voter fraud after postal inspectors found hundreds of ballots stuffed in a Paterson mailbox.\\n\\nThe Passaic County Board of Elections rejected 3,190 ballots, about 19 percent of the mail-in ballots cast in Paterson’s race. The question is how many were connected to the fraud allegations. Trump says all of them were corrupted, but a county elections official told the Paterson Press that 2,300 ballots were rejected as “part of the normal process,” meaning they were disqualified for common reasons such as signature mismatches or arriving after the deadline.\\n\\n“The Passaic County Board of Elections previously announced that it had decided not to count about 800 ballots because they allegedly were improperly bundled in mailboxes and would be turned over to law enforcement authorities for an investigation of potential irregularities,” according to the Paterson Press.\\n\\nDoing the math, that means less than 5 percent of the 16,747 ballots cast in this race can be linked to the fraud allegations.\\n\\nWhat would that look like in context? In an analysis of 31 local elections held the same day, New Jersey Spotlight found that 9.6 percent of ballots were rejected. “Most commonly, officials did not count ballots because the signature on the ballot did not match the one on file, the ballot arrived too late or the required certificate was not enclosed,” New Jersey Spotlight reported.\\n\\nOfficials are sending ballots to everyone\\n\\n“You’re sending out hundreds of millions of universal, mail-in ballots — hundreds of millions. Where are they going? Who are they being sent to?” (Trump coronavirus briefing, July 30)\\n\\n“But the mail-in ballots, they mail them to anybody. And they send them out by the millions.” (Trump interview on “Hannity,” June 25)\\n\\n“Sending out 80 MILLION BALLOTS to people who aren’t even asking for a Ballot is unfair and a total fraud in the making.” (Trump tweet, Sept. 10)\\n\\nAll wrong. Ballots are not being mailed to anyone and everyone. Some states are mailing ballots to all registered voters, accounting for 51 million voters combined, according to a Post tally. In California alone, that means 20 million ballots will be mailed.\\n\\nOther states, with a combined 44 million voters, are simply mailing ballot applications. In six states, in-person voting remains the only option unless voters provide an approved reason, such as a military deployment or illness, not related to fear of the novel coronavirus.\\n\\nDemocrats are trying to end signature verification\\n\\n“Why would they want to ban requirements for signature verification in federal elections? Who would want a bill banning signature verification? What’s that all about? You know what it’s about? Fraud. That’s what they want: fraud. They want to try and steal this election because, frankly, it’s the only way they can win the election.” (Trump coronavirus briefing in Bedminster, N.J., Aug. 8)\\n\\nFalse. Democrats are not trying to ban signature verification requirements for mail-in ballots.\\n\\nWhat Democrats have introduced is a bill that says U.S. election officials must notify any voter whose signature was deemed deficient and give them an opportunity to fix it. That’s not a ban on signature verification.\\n\\nRepublicans have argued that coronavirus relief legislation from House Democrats “guts” signature verification requirements, because it would allow 10 days for voters to clear up ballot signature deficiencies. That’s not a ban.\\n\\nDemocrats also have sued individual states and, in some cases, have won a court-ordered remedy process for voters to clear up any signature mismatches. That’s not a ban, either.\\n\\nTrump has not repeated this claim since we gave it Four Pinocchios.\\n\\nWendy R. Weiser, an election expert and vice president at the Brennan Center, previously told us that “the bigger problem is not forging signatures, but ballots being cast and not counted because the signature doesn’t match.” She cited “significant racial disparities” in rejecting ballots based on signature mismatches, with African Americans and other minorities more likely to have their votes discounted.\\n\\nAbsentee vs. mail-in ballots\\n\\n“Absentee Ballots are fine. A person has to go through a process to get and use them. Mail-In Voting, on the other hand, will lead to the most corrupt Election is USA history. Bad things happen with Mail-Ins.” (Trump tweet, June 28)\\n\\n“Like, I’m in White House, and I have to vote in Florida, et cetera, et cetera. You’re an absentee; that’s okay. But people go through a process for that. You know, they — it’s really pretty good. But the mail-in ballots, they mail them to anybody. And they send them out by the millions. I think I read over 30 million ballots are going to be sent out in California.” (Trump interview on “Hannity,” June 25)\\n\\n“I have no problem with people — I voted by absentee ballot, not by mail, I actually went to the office to cast my vote, but absentee ballots are fine.” (Barr interview on CNN, Sept. 2)\\n\\nA distinction without a difference. “Absentee ballots” and “mail-in ballots” are interchangeable terms. State officials use safeguards such as bar codes and signature matching to ensure the authenticity of all ballots cast by mail.\\n\\nFor the purposes of ballot verification, it makes no difference whether Barr mailed his absentee ballot or dropped it off in person. It doesn’t matter whether Trump had a commitment that prevented him from voting in person in Florida this year. Both had to identify themselves to register to vote and then submit ballots to local officials for verification. (CNN reported that Trump could have voted in Florida’s March 7 primary but was golfing in Palm Beach and mailed his ballot.)\\n\\nAbsentee voting began during the Civil War as an accommodation for soldiers outside their home states. Election officials began referring to the practice with other terms such as “advanced ballots,” “mailed ballots,” “vote-by-mail ballots” and “mail ballots” as more people were allowed to vote by mail for more reasons, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\\n\\nAside from Trump, many other top administration officials vote by mail, and the Trump campaign has encouraged mail voting in some states.\\n\\nBallots are vulnerable, drop boxes unsafe\\n\\n“So now we have a mail-in thing. And you see California — he’s sending out millions and millions of ballots. Where are they going? Where aren’t they going? Is the postman going to hand them out? Are they going to take them out of the mailboxes?” (Trump interview on “Hannity,” June 25)\\n\\n“Some states use ‘drop boxes’ for the collection of Universal Mail-In Ballots. So who is going to ‘collect’ the Ballots, and what might be done to them prior to tabulation? A Rigged Election?” (Trump tweet, Aug. 17)\\n\\n“So now the Democrats are using Mail Drop Boxes, which are a voter security disaster. Among other things, they make it possible for a person to vote multiple times. Also, who controls them, are they placed in Republican or Democrat areas? They are not Covid sanitized. A big fraud!” (Trump tweet, Aug. 23)\\n\\nLet’s pause to note Trump’s mind-bending contradictions. The president who told people to vote twice falsely complained that secure drop boxes for ballots allow repeated voting. Trump denigrates mask-wearing, holds campaign events with no social distancing and encourages in-person voting over mail ballots during an infectious-disease pandemic, yet claims to be worried about unwiped mailboxes.\\n\\nThe claims are false or baseless. No matter how a mail-in ballot gets to an election office, the verification process is the same, so duplicate ballots or votes wouldn’t be recognized. Twitter has placed a warning that obscures Trump’s Aug. 23 tweet, labeling it misinformation.\\n\\nBallot drop boxes are usually fortified in some way, placed in secure locations such as courthouses or election agencies, cemented to the ground and placed under camera or staff surveillance. Only election officials have access to their contents. No evidence shows that these boxes disproportionately advantage one party over the other.\\n\\nThe U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) recommends that bipartisan teams of officials, equipped with special ballot-carrying bags, security seals, chain-of-custody forms and personal protective gear such as disposable gloves, collect ballots from drop boxes.\\n\\n“A great example of using existing spaces comes from Madison, Wisconsin,” according to an EAC guidance document. “The city’s libraries were shut down owing to COVID-19. The City Clerk’s office decided to capitalize on locations that were already secure and located in places familiar to city residents. Working in partnership with the library, they used the book drops from three of the city’s public libraries and turned them into temporary ballot drop boxes.”\\n\\nDemocrats are trying to rig the election\\n\\n“The Democrats are also trying to rig the election by sending out tens of millions of mail-in ballots, using the China virus as the excuse for allowing people not to go to the polls.” (Trump speech in Phoenix, June 23)\\n\\n“Imagine a ballot being sent to a person regardless of eligibility, signed by someone else, picked up and delivered by a campaign operative, and still counted. Democrats are trying to legalize ballot harvesting nationwide.” (McDaniel tweet, June 23)\\n\\nStates governed by both Democrats (including California, Illinois and New York) and Republicans (including Alabama, Iowa and Nebraska) are expanding vote-by-mail this year to prevent the coronavirus from spreading. Utah, also governed by Republicans, is one of the five states that already held vote-by-mail elections before the pandemic.\\n\\nIn May, Trump falsely accused Nevada and Michigan state officials of breaking the law by expanding vote-by-mail for their primaries and threatened to pull some federal funding. It wasn’t clear he could do so, and Trump never followed through.\\n\\nMichigan and Nevada are battlegrounds in the November elections, but they were not the only states planning to use absentee or mail-in ballots to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus for the primaries. For some reason, Trump did not tweet similar threats to Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska or West Virginia, several states doing the same thing as Michigan and Nevada, but where his reelection prospects are better.\\n\\n‘Anybody that walks in California is going to get a ballot.’\\n\\n“In California, the governor sent, I hear — or is sending — millions of ballots all over the state. Millions. To anybody. To anybody. People that aren’t citizens, illegals. Anybody that walks in California is going to get a ballot.” (Trump remarks during a discussion on diabetes, May 26)\\n\\n“Think of it: California. He’s going to be sending out millions and millions of ballots. Well, where are they going? Where are these ballots going? Who’s getting them? Who is not getting them? A little section that’s Republican. Will they be stolen from mailboxes as they get put in by the mailman? Will they be taken from the mailmen and the mailwomen? Will they be forged? Who is signing them? Who’s signing them? What, are they signed on the kitchen table and sent in? Will they be counterfeited by groups inside our nation? Will they be counterfeited, maybe by the millions, by foreign powers who don’t want to see Trump win because nobody has been tougher on trade or making our country great again?” (Trump speech in Phoenix, June 23)\\n\\nTrump’s disinformation campaign on vote-by-mail is built on easily debunked statements and wild speculation, throwing anything at the wall, as these comments show.\\n\\nHe often describes California, the most populous U.S. state, as ground zero for a looming voter fraud scandal. California is mailing ballots only to registered voters, about 20 million total. Undocumented immigrants cannot register to vote, and the Democrats who govern the state are not proposing to give them voting rights.\\n\\nThe Pinocchio Test\\n\\nThis is a breathtaking onslaught on the truth and the integrity of an upcoming U.S. election. We expect it from Russia, especially after the copious evidence of its disinformation campaign in 2016 to benefit Trump. But to see it emanate from the president of the United States, the attorney general and the head of the Republican Party is nothing short of stunning.\\n\\nEvery one of these claims earns Four Pinocchios.\\n\\nFour Pinocchios\\n\\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\\n\\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/greece-court-extreme-right/2020/10/07/b18261a4-07ea-11eb-8719-0df159d14794_story.html', 'Full Text': 'The ruling all but cements the fall of Golden Dawn, a party that a decade earlier had grown on the back of Greece’s financial and migrant crises and presaged the rise of other, less extreme European nationalist parties.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the verdict, which followed a trial lasting more than five years, 18 top members of the party were found guilty of being part of a criminal organization. Seven, including the leader, Nikos Michaloliakos — who once claimed there were no gas chambers in Auschwitz — were found guilty of running a criminal organization.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThey have not yet been sentenced.\\n\\nMany outside observers had portrayed the trial as an example of a democratic country grappling with its most hardcore political faction. Greece is now governed by a center-right party, and far-right sentiment has receded to the margins. But the trial was a chance to look back on what happened during a decade of severe tumult, when the economy was collapsing and migrants were arriving in historic numbers, creating resentments that Golden Dawn saw as an opportunity.\\n\\nAlthough Europe has seen the rise of many far-right parties, few — if any — have been as overtly fascist as Golden Dawn. Activists and prosecutors, and many politicians, describe the party as a neo-Nazi organization. Its logo echoes the swastika. Soon after the party’s founding in the 1980s, an official party magazine described Adolf Hitler as “the great man of the 20th century.”\\n\\nAs late as 2009, the party had virtually no electoral support. But by 2012, amid debt crises and austerity measures, Golden Dawn was the Greece’s third-largest party, holding 18 of the 300 seats in Parliament.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGolden Dawn tried to win support from the neediest citizens, setting up food distribution and blood banks while making clear that the generosity was for “Greeks only.”\\n\\nBut prosecutors argued that, even as its members sat in Parliament, the group was essentially a paramilitary criminal organization, orchestrating street violence, attacks on immigrants and the 2013 murder of Pavlos Fyssas, a rapper who was also known for anti-fascist activism. A self-professed Golden Dawn member, Giorgos Roupakias, was found guilty Wednesday of the killing.\\n\\nThe murder set off widespread public opposition to the party, and, as members stood trial, defections and poll defeats further weakened it. Golden Dawn no longer holds any seats in the Greek Parliament.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“In the conscience of the Greek people they are a criminal organisation and will go where they deserve go, in the trash can of history,” Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister from 2015 until 2019, wrote on his official Facebook page after the verdict was announced.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe violence examined during the trial mostly took place between 2010 and 2013. Prosecutors showed photos of Golden Dawn recruits at training camps posing with assault weapons and giving Nazi-like salutes.\\n\\nThe party’s leaders had promised to rid Greek society of its “stench” — a term they used to refer to immigration. Some activists saw Golden Dawn’s hand in a spate of attacks on foreigners.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Golden Dawn successfully exploited the system to lawfully enter Parliament, but at the same time kept its neo-Nazi identity. This was a point of admiration for extremists worldwide,” said Vassiliki Georgiadou, a professor of political science at Panteion University in Athens.\\n\\nAlthough the party has splintered, other small far-right parties have been trying to fill the void. And many Greeks still resent what they see as an unfair migration burden — with other European countries unwilling to help host newly arrived asylum seekers.\\n\\n“History has shown that most of Golden Dawn’s voters were driven by circumstances and condemn the party’s extremism,” Georgiadou said. “Immigration, however, will continue to drive nationalist sentiment in Greece. This remains a worrying trend that can only be resolved if Europeans work together to provide solutions. For extremism to stop, it must not be given space to grow.”\\n\\nGreece’s hard left celebrated the verdict, with some anti-fascist activists represented in the crowd outside the courthouse.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPrime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis portrayed the court decision as a victory for the entire political spectrum.\\n\\n“Αfter the Greek people voted the neo-Nazi party of Golden Dawn out of parliament in the last election, today the Greek justice system convicted its leadership of operating as a criminal organization,” he said on Twitter. “A truly historic day for Greece, democracy and the rule of law.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/09/24/ruth-bader-ginsburg-death-supreme-court-international-effects/', 'Full Text': 'But just because the court is a thoroughly American institution, that doesn’t mean its impact stops at U.S. borders. Its decisions affect foreign citizens, and the political wrangling over its future will resonate globally for years.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe brewing battle over the seat vacated by liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died on Friday at the age of 87, is being watched closely by international legal experts. President Trump has pledged to move forward with a high court nominee before the November election, potentially enshrining an overwhelming conservative majority on the court.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Justice Ginsburg was a globally significant jurist,” Adam Goldenberg, a lawyer at McCarthy Tétrault in Toronto and former clerk at the Canadian Supreme Court told Today’s WorldView. “This story is going to captivate people in our profession around the world.”\\n\\nDecisions made by the Supreme Court can have significant practical impact abroad, especially when they involve commercial or administrative law. They can also affect people outside U.S. borders even when rulings come down to interpretations of the U.S. Constitution.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOne high-profile ruling in June 2018 found that the president has the authority to ban travelers from majority-Muslim countries if he thinks it necessary.\\n\\nThe impact of domestic politics on the court in that decision was hard to miss. A Republican-led Senate had blocked the appointment of the Obama administration’s nominee to the court after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February 2016, which would have resulted in a liberal majority.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe conservative who eventually replaced Scalia, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, was among the five who sided with the government — ultimately upholding a travel ban activists say has affected hundreds of millions of people overseas.\\n\\nThe Court is slated to hear more cases with clear international implications soon. This summer it agreed to take up a case that would decide whether foreign plaintiffs could use a 1789 law to sue U.S. corporations for alleged human rights abuses that occurred abroad.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe case, due to be heard in December, revolves around allegations that the U.S. company Cargill and the American branch of Nestle had allowed the use of child slave labor on cocoa farms in Ivory Coast. David Orentlicher, a law professor at University of Nevada at Las Vegas, said that the “the implications for holding domestic corporations liable are huge” and he could see deep divisions among Justices.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOther forthcoming cases with international implications include one relating to artwork stolen from Jewish art dealers by Nazi Germany and property taken during World War II by the Hungarian government. The current governments of Germany and Hungary are parties to these cases.\\n\\nDespite their ideological divides it is not always clear how Justices will rule in cases outside of constitutional law. FiveThirtyEight reported this summer that the Court’s decisions had been in line with public opinion in all but two cases last term.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut there are cases with international implications where a new conservative justice could shift the landscape. In June, the Court rejected the Trump administration’s attempt to dismantle the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, a program that protected undocumented immigrants who entered the United States as children.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe decision to protect the DACA program was one of two cases this year that saw Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., considered a conservative, side with Ginsburg and other liberals in a 5-to-4 ruling that rested on administrative law. Trump has decried these moves as “shotgun blasts” into the faces of Republicans.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has shown no signs of giving up its fight against DACA. But ending protection for up to 650,000 DACA participants would have considerable international implications: Some “dreamers” who left the United States preemptively have described rough transitions to life in their old homes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDespite its capacity for global impact, the Supreme Court can be an insular institution. During the Senate confirmation hearings for now-Justice Sonia Sotomayor in 2009, there were fierce debates about the extent to which the court should cite foreign law in its own rulings, which was viewed as “radical” by some.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHere, the loss of Ginsburg may be felt, too. Along with Justice Stephen G. Breyer (who wrote a book on the subject), she advocated for the Supreme Court taking a more international view of its responsibilities. University of Chicago professor Paul Poast argued that it was one of the key legacies she left behind.\\n\\nThe Court still has isolationist tendencies. Oona Hathaway, a professor at Yale Law School, said she thought the 2009 debate had “scared a lot of justices away from citing foreign judgments. And it’s hard to write about international law if you can’t cite foreign judgments.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe story cuts the other way, too. Though the court’s power remains considerable, its prestige has been waning for years.

It’s tempting to dismiss this as a desperate political ploy unlikely to make a difference. The thing is, thanks to Joe Biden’s near-abandonment of this crucial battleground state, the gambit might just succeed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt the moment, Trump and Biden are basically tied among registered voters here. If past is precedent, Biden should handily win Latinos in Florida, as Hillary Clinton did in 2016 when she amassed more than 62 percent of the vote. But amazingly, one recent poll showed Trump leading with Latinos in Florida. Another showed him splitting the Latino vote with Biden in heavily Democratic Miami-Dade, the state’s most populous county, which is 70 percent Hispanic. This week’s Post survey was more favorable, but it still shows Biden well behind Clinton’s pace.\\n\\nThis is a voting bloc Biden can’t afford to ignore. Florida had 2.2 million registered Hispanic voters as of January, about 17 percent of all registered voters in the state. And among Florida’s Latino groups, the state’s 1.2 million Cuban Americans are the largest.\\n\\nIt is true that, as first-generation hard-liners from the 1960s and ’70s are replaced by younger Cuban Americans, the group’s historical allegiances have shifted, with Republican voter registration in this community dropping from 70 percent in the 1990s to 54 percent in 2018. But it might not be changing fast enough for Biden. Trump won 54 percent of Florida’s Cuban American vote in 2016. And Latino voters — many of them Cuban — helped flip a Senate seat and hand the governorship to Republicans in the otherwise “Blue Wave” year of 2018.\\n\\nThis is where Lagoa comes in. Trump almost certainly needs Florida to win, so he has made a concerted effort to court Latinos, especially Cuban Americans, who love to hear him talk tough on socialism and hammer away at runaway radicals. Cubans are coveted because they zealously turn out to vote in larger numbers compared with other Hispanics, analysts say. But Trump’s anti-socialist message also resonates with Florida’s Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and Colombians, whose home countries have grappled with leftist dictatorships or movements.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSpanish-language radio in Miami applauds Trump every day. He campaigns here relentlessly. His followers are visible and loud. They lead caravans by car, boat and golf cart. They turn up en masse in shopping-mall parking lots, handing out pro-Trump placards with the swiftness of blackjack dealers. Trump gets that Florida Latinos are famously hugs-and-kisses people. They like to see you in person.\\n\\nBiden, by contrast, has been invisible. The novel coronavirus has confined him to small screens or even smaller, last-minute, barely promoted campaign events. Many Latinos here don’t even know Biden’s powerful story or Senate track record. He visited Tampa this month, but almost nobody noticed.\\n\\nHe’s also failing to break through to Latinos with his messaging. South Florida Zip codes lead the nation in Obamacare enrollees — but Biden isn’t winning over voters on health care. We’ve reached into the Greek alphabet this year to name our hurricanes, but his climate change comments aren’t breaking through. Even Biden’s strong stances on defeating covid-19 and fixing our immigration system have fallen short. Florida, sadly, never took covid-19 that seriously to begin with. And immigration does not play as well here because Cubans, until recently, had their own privileged immigration status and Puerto Ricans — whose population numbers rival those of Cuban Americans — are U.S. citizens.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA Lagoa nomination, then, would be another key indicator that Trump is committed to, and connecting with, Cuban Americans and South Florida Latinos in a way Biden has not been. “If he nominates a Hispanic woman, I suspect it will have influence on two or three percent of the vote,” says Fernand Amandi, a Miami-based Democratic strategist and expert on the Hispanic electorate.\\n\\nTwo or 3 percent might not seem like much. But this is Florida, where presidential-election margins are so slim that tropical gusts can flip them. And among a large and passionate voting pool such as the Cuban American community — one Biden has done too little to court — that 2 or 3 percent could well prove decisive.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/justice-dept-targets-new-york-seattle-and-portland-over-protests/2020/09/21/9e85e46a-fc08-11ea-b555-4d71a9254f4b_story.html', 'Full Text': '“We cannot allow federal tax dollars to be wasted,” Attorney General William P.

But he rarely, if ever, defended himself. No matter the attack against him — and there were some doozies — he dispensed with them quickly. And in the GOP primary debates, his answers involved three parts: I am great; you are terrible; and a nonsensical digression that often changed the subject entirely.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFour years later, Trump is not different, but the circumstances are. The Trump we see at the first presidential debate in Cleveland on Tuesday may be even harder to debate than last time, because whatever ability he possessed to engage has been subsumed by a constant need to launch into tirades over grievances. (“I sort of prepare every day by just doing what I’m doing,” he told “Fox and Friends” about his pre-debate regimen.) He exists in a double bubble — isolated in the Oval Office, consuming and regurgitating nothing but friendly right-wing media and Twitter bile. And he’s desperate: The debate presents the first big chance to shake up a race he’s losing, but he doesn’t seem to have a plan to turn things around other than to hope for Joe Biden to collapse. After studying Trump in 2016, and our national tutorial every day since, here’s what I think Biden can expect as they face off three times over the next 24 days. (Although it was never really in doubt that Trump would debate, expect grumbling after the first exchange about being treated unfairly and noise about skipping the two others.)\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDebates are another opportunity to speak directly to voters. If you’re doing it right as a candidate, you’re just a more distilled version of your usual self. If you’re grasping for a debate strategy, you have bigger problems than debating: Your message should be a simple extension of your overall campaign message and strategy. Biden has both. Trump has neither.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome armchair pundits hold that debates don’t matter, which is absurd. Of course a 90-minute performance in front of a Super Bowl-size TV audience can affect the vote. The valid question is how much they matter. Clinton, after all, clearly won the debates against Trump.\\n\\nOne challenge is about style: Biden will be doing some actual debating while Trump verbally hopscotches around, telling us how perfect his call to the Ukrainian president was. How smoothly he handled the final 10 feet of the slippery ramp. Interpreting coronavirus charts. Boasting about how he nailed his cognitive test.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn any given day, Trump decides whether he wants to speak, and where and when. What to talk about. Whether to take questions, and if so, from whom. How long to let reporters speak before interrupting and berating them. And he decides when he has had enough.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat’s not a debate, and it leaves him ill-equipped for one. Because the 2016 Trump with the clear message, honed attack and efficient defense mechanism has given way to something else: a politician who cannot articulate his vision for a second term. On offense, he’s a mess; he can’t settle on an overarching attack on Biden, or even two. Even his already-overrated nicknaming skills have all but failed him. As for defense, his existence now entirely involves explaining, misdirecting, denying — whatever it takes to address every item on his grievance list. Which is as long as his tie.\\n\\nTrump will certainly check the “consistency” box: He will be the same on Tuesday as he was two Tuesdays ago, as he was in July, as he will be in October. But that person is losing. So he has to change the trajectory of the race. In the context of the debates, there are two simple ways to accomplish that: by doing really well and/or by forcing Biden to do very badly. (Curiously, Trump’s overall strategy has been to hope for Biden to make enough unforced errors for Trump to win. Setting aside the likelihood of any debate moment being so catastrophic that Biden couldn’t recover during two more debates and a month of campaigning, it’s an awfully passive plan.)\\n\\nAD\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt is easy to say someone needs to be prepared for anything and everything. That’s typically rhetorical. Here, Biden does, in fact, need to be ready for the unexpected, because Trump has proven he’ll say anything and everything.\\n\\nIf I were reprising my 2016 role for Biden’s debate prep, I would add a few wrinkles. I’d make sure to take a jackhammer to the English language: stopping short, declaring war on proper nouns, the things Trump does daily that leave the listener knowing he just screwed up but not always sure how. Just as you squint and say “huh?” after Trump’s garbles, Biden will have the same impulse. And although it would guarantee him a spot in the debate Hall of Fame, a Hillary-esque full body shimmy might not look the same on Biden.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYou don’t need to watch dozens of hours of video to know that Trump’s focus is less like a laser and more like a disco ball. Debates, however, ostensibly have a topical structure. In a July interview, Tuesday’s moderator, Fox News host Chris Wallace, proved that he can handle Trump. But he will have his hands full trying to keep the president on the six topics announced in advance. In one remarkable answer to a question about Social Security reform during a 2016 Republican debate, Trump took a tortured detour that ended with North Korea’s military — in just 17 seconds. Biden cannot rely on Wallace to keep Trump engaged in a coherent conversation. He’ll have to find ways to prevent Trump from hijacking the proceedings to indulge one of his preferred rants.\\n\\nBiden has a few basic decisions to make about his approach. Some are obvious. Others, such as staying high vs. going low, trigger Talmudic-level disagreements. For instance, when Trump attacks Biden’s family as corrupt, of course no Democrat would argue that he should simply stand there and take it. Even Michelle Obama added this caveat to her famous admonition: “Going high does not mean putting on a smile and saying nice things when confronted by viciousness and cruelty.” But does Biden turn the question around toward Trump’s family? Ivanka Trump is the most obvious target, as a government employee who still has business interests in China. But attacking Trump’s eldest daughter is far more fraught than, say, going after his son Donald Jr. Identifying — let alone navigating — these lines on live TV is never simple.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe best way to deal with Trump, though, won’t be to try to fact-check him in real time or to let lies and absurdities go in the hope that moderators — or viewers — catch them. There’s a third option: Preempt the president. Clearly and strongly preview for the 100 million people watching what will happen in the debate as soon it begins. Biden should say early on that we all know what’s coming. Not to remind voters. But to remind Trump, by speaking on behalf of the majority of the country, that everyone is on to him, in a reversal of Trump’s favorite “everyone is saying” paralipsis device:\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“C’mon, Mr. President. Everyone knows that whatever you call fake is real. Whatever you call a lie is the truth. Whatever you accuse others of doing is what you’ve done. And whatever you make fun of me for saying by accident only serves to deflect from what you say on purpose.”\\n\\nThe 2020 version of Trump is constantly winging it, hoping voters will forget what he has said and done while focusing on his grievance du jour. He needs everyone watching the debate to pretend he never said there were only a few cases of the coronavirus in the United States, or that it would be gone in a week, or that he confessed, on tape, to lying about its lethality.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the end, both men’s debate preparations rely on what they have done over the course of the entire campaign.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor the last 18 months, Joe Biden has debated Donald Trump on the issues from afar. Over that same period, Trump has done nothing but assault Biden’s character. Trump’s debate preparations — “what I’m doing” every day — are the first in history to include behavior that ended up in impeachment.\\n\\nIn Cleveland, an unshrinking force will meet an unvarying object.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/christopher-wray-fbi-election-interference/2020/09/23/e93d4230-fdea-11ea-b555-4d71a9254f4b_story.html', 'Full Text': '“Americans must have confidence in our voting system and our election infrastructure,” Wray told the Senate Homeland Security Committee. “We are not going to tolerate foreign interference in our elections.”\\n\\nSen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) pressed Wray about claims made by Trump and his supporters that foreign interests could interfere with the election by sending in bogus mail-in ballots. Wray responded by echoing the past assurances from U.S. intelligence officials that they’ve seen no sign of such activity so far in this election cycle.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“We have not seen historically any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it’s by mail or otherwise” Wray said, though he added fraud has been detected “at the local level from time to time.”\\n\\nThe FBI director, seemingly aware that his comments about election interference last week angered the president, said he was “in no way minimizing” any threat to ballots. Changing the outcome of a federal election “would be a major challenge for an adversary,” he said, adding that the FBI “would investigate seriously” if it saw indications of such an effort.\\n\\nHours after Wray’s testimony, federal prosecutors in Pennsylvania issued a statement that they had found nine discarded military mail-in ballots as part of an investigation into a small number of such votes. Seven of the nine ballots were marked for Trump, and the other two remained sealed, so the markings on those ballots were unknown, Justice Department officials said after initially declaring that all nine ballots had been cast for the president.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe president’s campaign quickly seized on the statement, tweeting that “Democrats are trying to steal the election.”\\n\\nTrump has argued that mail-in voting is highly suspect, saying ballots requested by individual voters are secure but that ballot applications sent out based on voter rolls are not. On Thursday he urged people in Florida, an important battleground state, to “make sure to request” a mail-in ballot and submit it.\\n\\nThursday’s hearing about threats to the country ranged over topics from the upcoming election, including civil unrest over police misconduct and the hacking of U.S. companies.\\n\\nRepublican senators asked Wray what more could be done to stem the violent flare-ups at some protests that have occurred throughout the country since the spring.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSen.

We have seen organized tactical activity at the local regional level,” Wray said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe FBI is finding “a lot of the activity is organized at what I would call more of a tactical level than a strategic level, and organized more locally,” he said, adding “that in no way, in no way, diminishes how serious and dangerous it is. We don’t view how nationally organized something is as a proxy for how dangerous it is.”\\n\\nBut he cautioned that some of the people who may be involved in violence have “a mishmash” or “salad bar” of ideologies, and as a result many of them don’t have easily defined motives beyond an attraction to violence.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) argued that the Black Lives Matter movement is supporting those creating havoc at protests, and suggested that violent individuals may be flying around the country to do so.\\n\\n“We need to find out who’s financing them,” said Paul, who along with his wife was pursued by angry protesters weeks ago in Washington and had to be protected by D.C. police. “They’re saying their goal is to terrorize public officials, their goal is terror.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWray, who testified last week at a similar hearing before a House committee, indicated then that racially motivated extremism composes the largest share of the FBI’s domestic terrorism cases, and that white supremacist ideology appears to drive most of those cases.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe FBI director has tried with limited success to keep the bureau out of the intensifying partisan fights as the election nears. At last week’s hearing, he told lawmakers that Russia hopes to “denigrate” Trump’s opponent, former vice president Joe Biden, through social media.\\n\\nThe president expressed displeasure with the director’s answers, saying they were not only soft on antifa, but that Wray neglected to mention China would like to see Biden elected. Asked whether he would consider removing Wray over his testimony, the president responded, “We’re looking at a lot of different things.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I did not like his answers,” Trump said last week. “I’m not sure he liked them either.

The promise is that presidents can provide the leadership needed for effective governmental action. The fear is that, if they are given (or take) too much power, they threaten to become autocrats. Since its founding, the nation has struggled to find the right balance between the promise and the fear to sustain a government that is both effective and democratic.\\n\\nThe Constitution’s framers designed a system with a separation of powers and weak presidency that rendered governmental action difficult. This architecture may have been fine for a primitive society of 4 million people. But as we show in our recent book, “Presidents, Populism, and the Crisis of Democracy,” this framework has been challenged by complex problems of modernization. Attempts to build a government capable of dealing with these problems relied heavily on the presidency, whose power grew considerably over the decades — notably via reforms during the Progressive Era and the New Deal that yielded a presidentially led administrative state.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor much of American history, therefore, the promise outweighed the fear in political practice and debate. But Vietnam and the Nixon presidency led to congressional reforms to constrain and counterbalance presidential power, including the War Powers Resolution, the Budget and Impoundment Control Act and the Ethics in Government Act. With the populist presidency of Donald Trump, who has pushed the bounds of legality and violated long-standing democratic norms, fear of presidential power has soared to unprecedented heights. In response, members of Congress have proposed changes that are circulating on Capitol Hill. These include:\\n\\nOur book explains the logic behind such reforms and their expansion. We also highlight others, such as dramatically reducing the number of presidential appointments to produce a bureaucracy run by professionals rather than political loyalists and insulating national intelligence agencies from direct presidential control.\\n\\nIf we fixate on Trump and the fear of presidential power, however, we risk losing sight of the trade-offs that James identified. Democracy will survive only as long as the public’s needs are met by a government capable of effective action. Our book explains how government’s inability to deal adequately with the socioeconomic disruptions of recent decades — globalization, automation, immigration — fomented economic despair and cultural anxiety among millions of Americans, fueling the anti-system populist rage that put Trump in the White House. He — and the populist threat to democracy — are a product of ineffective government. Better government can defuse this threat.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat would this involve? Attention should focus on the legislative process, which lies at the core of government and is clearly broken. With entrepreneurial legislators tied to their own states and districts, lawmaking is mired in special-interest politics, political infighting and gridlock. On all sorts of issues — a nonfunctioning immigration system, skyrocketing debt, unsustainable entitlement programs, a warming climate — legislators can’t do anything at all. Even when Congress does act, its laws are not intellectually coherent programs aimed at solving problems so much as cobbled-together patchworks intended to placate organized interests and attract votes.\\n\\nPresidents are different. Far more than legislators — and Trump aside — they pay attention to the interests of the nation as a whole. Obsessed with their legacies, they look to build comprehensive programs and policies that solve national problems and secure their places in history.\\n\\nHow might presidents refocus politics on comprehensive solutions to national problems? Here is an instructive example from the past. Under the 1974 Trade Act and its reauthorizations, presidents have been granted the power to introduce trade agreements to Congress, which must then vote up or down on a majority basis within a fixed period of time in the House and Senate. Congress explicitly gave this fast-track authority to the president to temper the influence of powerful organized interests demanding favors and exemptions. The result, economists say, has been a more efficient process that privileges national interests and promotes international trade.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis experience suggests that a “universal fast-track” system, under which all legislation would get the same treatment as trade agreements, might move U.S. policy toward a more effective focus on shared national problems. Under universal fast-track, presidentially crafted bills would be presented to Congress under the same rules as fast-tracked trade negotiations. Legislators would be free to vote no, of course, and to design and pass their own legislation (which the president could veto). But they would be required to vote on the president’s bills and do it quickly.\\n\\nIf the United States wants to safeguard democratic principles and practices, it will need reforms that address the fear of presidential power by imposing new constraints on what presidents can do. Constraints alone, however, won’t build a more effective government. Our separation-of-powers system is inherently unwieldy. Addressing today’s challenges requires the kind of coherent, problem-solving leadership that presidents can offer. That is their promise. And that is why presidential leadership, responsibly leveraged, enables American democracy to work, win public support and survive.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWilliam Howell (@ProfWillHowell) is the Sydney Stein Professor in American Politics at the University of Chicago, director of the Center for Effective Government, and co-host of the Not Another Politics Podcast at the Harris School of Public Policy.\\n\\nTerry Moe is the William Bennett Munro Professor of Political Science at Stanford University and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/barrett-supreme-court-trump/2020/09/26/20863794-feac-11ea-830c-a160b331ca62_story.html', 'Full Text': \"While acknowledging on the NPR program “On Point” that “it’s clearly a good result that these millions of Americans won’t lose their tax subsidies,” she tore apart the decision, saying, “The dissent has the better of the legal argument.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBarrett’s response to the ruling — along with her assertion that in a 2012 case, “Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute” — endeared her to conservatives. It also won her the admiration of President Trump, who on Saturday nominated her to fill the seat of the liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died earlier this month.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTo many Democrats, however, Barrett’s conservative legal views and her closeness to her former boss and mentor, the conservative icon Justice Antonin Scalia, have raised concerns that she will push the court further to the right in ways that could be difficult to reverse for years or even decades. Scalia, who died in 2016, wrote the dissent that Barrett praised.\\n\\nNow, these two clashing views of Barrett will be at the center of the nation’s attention. She will be grilled by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee in hearings being rushed by the Trump administration, which wants her confirmed before Election Day.\\n\\nWhile Republicans appear to have the votes to elevate her from her position on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, which covers Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin, Democrats hope concerns about her record will help tip both presidential and congressional races in their favor — and that they could raise sufficient questions to delay her nomination until after the election.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor Democrats, the examination of Barrett before a potential audience of millions is a chance for a do-over after their relatively brief review of her 2017 nomination by Trump to her current seat. That hearing is mainly remembered for the way Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) sought to make Barrett’s Catholicism an issue, saying that she was concerned that “the dogma lives loudly within you.”\\n\\nBarrett pushed back strongly, saying she would never let her religion influence her decisions. Some Democrats scoffed at the assertion, but Republicans were galvanized to defend Barrett, printing dogma slogans on T-shirts and dismissing the idea that she would let her faith affect her legal judgment.\\n\\nBarrett’s rise has coincided with Republican efforts to take advantage of their control of the Senate to reshape the Supreme Court, a legacy that could far outlast Trump. She would be a capstone of such a strategy: If Barrett, 48, is confirmed, her vote on cases involving health care, abortion, immigration, gun control and many other issues could prove decisive.\\n\\nShe has a compelling personal story that has drawn bipartisan appreciation. The eldest of seven children, Barrett was raised in Louisiana by her father, an oil industry attorney, and her mother, a homemaker. A stellar high school student, she was an English undergraduate at Rhodes College in Memphis and then received a degree from the University of Notre Dame Law School, where she edited the law review and was first in her 1997 class.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBarrett, who lives in South Bend, Ind., and has taught at Notre Dame since 2002, was named “Distinguished Professor of the Year” on three occasions, according to the school’s website.\\n\\nIn 1999 she married another Notre Dame Law School graduate, Jesse M. Barrett, and they have seven children, including two adopted from Haiti. Their youngest child has Down syndrome. Barrett said last year at the Notre Dame Club in Washington that she had “anxiety about balancing kids and work,” but with help from her husband and other family members, she felt she could handle both roles. She added: “What greater thing can you do than raise children? That’s where you have your greatest impact on the world.”\\n\\nBarrett has said she relies deeply on her strict adherence to her Catholic faith, even as she stresses that it does not affect her judicial decisions. She is a member of a lay-led Christian group called People of Praise, which began in South Bend and has about 2,000 members around the world. The group is charismatic, similar to the demonstrative style of Protestant Pentecostal gatherings, and believes that dark forces abound in the world. The group’s female leaders were called “handmaids” before the Margaret Atwood novel gave that phrase new meaning.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBarrett directly addressed the issue of judges influenced by their faith in a 1998 paper she co-wrote titled “Catholic Judges in Capital Cases,” which has since become one of the most scrutinized works of her career. Barrett co-wrote that Catholic judges are obligated to follow the law but also “to adhere to their church’s teachings on moral matters.”\\n\\nThe article argued that Catholic judges opposed to the death penalty on religious grounds should recuse themselves from cases that would require sentencing someone to death. Her co-author was John Garvey, now the president of Catholic University, who declined to comment. In an op-ed published by The Washington Post on Friday, Garvey wrote: “We argued that recusal would be the appropriate course of action for a Catholic judge who felt that his or her religious beliefs were in conflict with upholding the law.”\\n\\nAfter graduating from Notre Dame, Barrett came to the attention of Judge Laurence H. Silberman, who typically hired law clerks from his alma mater, Harvard Law, with a few others from Yale and the University of Chicago. He was convinced by two Notre Dame professors, both fellow Harvard graduates, to consider Barrett to join his chambers as a clerk at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“She has brilliant analytic skills combined with an innate sense of decency and kindness,” Silberman said in an interview. “And she was a strong believer in judicial restraint,” referring to the theory that judges should follow the Constitution, not their own views.\\n\\nSilberman said he was so impressed that he recommended her to be a clerk for Scalia, a conservative icon on the Supreme Court, for whom she served from 1998 to 1999.\\n\\nIn an interview with the Notre Dame television station, Barrett said she relished going “toe to toe” with Scalia, recounting how “he treats you like an equal in these discussions so you really have to be up to the task.” He instilled in her the need to “see things from every side” as she wrote drafts of opinions that he eventually signed.\\n\\nScholarly writing\\n\\nIn 2000, Barrett began working for the Washington law firm of Miller, Cassidy, Larroca & Lewin. She then taught at George Washington University Law School before returning in 2002 to her alma mater to eventually become a professor at Notre Dame Law School, focusing on federal courts.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBarrett, meanwhile, issued a stream of scholarly writings that have gained new attention in light of her ascent. Her view on stare decisis — the principle that courts should be guided by legal precedent — has spurred concerns that she would be open to revisiting Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion rights case.\\n\\nIn a 2013 article for the Texas Law Review, she wrote that “the public response to controversial cases like Roe reflects public rejection of the proposition that stare decisis can declare a permanent victor in a divisive constitutional struggle.” She did not explicitly express an opinion on Roe v. Wade but argued that jurists should not be bound by precedent in all cases. All the current justices agree that stare decisis does not mean precedent is never overturned.\\n\\n“I tend to agree with those who say a justice’s duty is to the Constitution,” she wrote, “and that it is thus more legitimate for her to enforce her best understanding of the Constitution rather than a precedent she thinks clearly in conflict with it.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfter Barrett was nominated for a U.S. Court of Appeals seat, much of the hearing focused on whether her Catholicism would unduly influence her decisions. Feinstein, in expressing her concern that Barrett would be too motivated by the faith’s dogma, focused on abortion rights. The senator said she assumed she was nominated because “you would be a no vote on Roe.”\\n\\nBarrett responded that because she was being considered for a position on a court of appeals and not the Supreme Court, “there would be no opportunity to be a no vote on Roe.”\\n\\nBarrett also was asked about the article she co-wrote two decades earlier on Catholic judges. While she said she would write the article differently with the hindsight of 20 years, she said she stood by “the core proposition of that article, which is that if there is ever a conflict between a judge’s personal conviction and that judge’s duty under the rule of law, that it is never, ever permissible for that judge to follow their personal convictions in the decision of the case rather than what the law requires.”\\n\\nBarrett was confirmed on Oct. 31, 2017, by a vote of 55 to 43, with the support of three Democrats.\\n\\nScalia's influence\\n\\nThe influence of Scalia has been a continuing thread throughout Barrett’s career. Scalia, who was said to have viewed his clerks as interchangeable, viewed Barrett in a different class. At her investiture for the appeals court, one of Barrett’s co-clerks from that term remembered Scalia having said, “Isn’t Amy terrific?”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nScalia is lionized by conservatives for his transformative career on the court; Barrett, who like Scalia considers herself an “originalist” in constitutional interpretation, would be his first protegee to attain a seat on the high court.\\n\\nIn her nearly three years on the U.S. Court of Appeals, Barrett has been involved in about 100 rulings. While she wrote some of the opinions, she joined many others without comment. In general, her decisions have heartened conservatives and alarmed liberals.\\n\\nShe joined a dissent about a ruling that found unconstitutional an Indiana law banning abortions sought because of the sex or disability of a fetus. The panel ruled, as it said other courts have, that Supreme Court precedent did not allow questioning of a woman’s reasoning for an abortion before viability. Barrett then joined with three other judges to declare their disagreement.\\n\\n“Does the Constitution supply a right to evade regulation by choosing a child’s genetic makeup after conception, aborting any fetus whose genes show a likelihood that the child will be short, or nearsighted, or intellectually average, or lack perfect pitch — or be the ‘wrong’ sex or race?” said the dissent joined by Barrett.\\n\\nBarrett also objected to her court blocking another Indiana abortion restriction, which required parental notification when a girl younger than 18 seeks an abortion, even if she had asked a court to provide consent, instead of her parents. The judge would have to provide notification unless he or she found it was not in the juvenile’s “best interests.”\\n\\nBarrett was not on the panel that had kept the law from going into effect, and her involvement was not on the merits of the case. She joined with four other judges, though, to say that the full circuit should decide whether it was right to keep the law from being enforced while it was being challenged.\\n\\n“Preventing a state statute from taking effect is a judicial act of extraordinary gravity in our federal structure,” wrote Judge Michael Stephen Kanne, whose dissent Barrett and the others joined. In June, the Supreme Court sent the case back to lower courts to reconsider in light of its decision to strike a restrictive Louisiana abortion law.\\n\\nPraise from conservatives\\n\\nIn a decision involving gun rights, Barrett won praise from conservatives concerned that the Second Amendment’s protections have not been properly respected by the Supreme Court, and also for her constitutional approach. Her decision relied heavily on the “originalist” approach to constitutional interpretation favored by her old boss Scalia and the court’s most conservative members.\\n\\nBarrett dissented from a panel decision that upheld federal and Wisconsin state laws banning felons from having guns. They were being challenged by a man convicted of a nonviolent crime, mail fraud. Two judges on the panel said such laws are reasonably related to the government’s important goal of keeping guns out of the hands of those convicted of serious crimes.\\n\\nBut Barrett, launching a deep dive into the country’s past, said legislatures at the time of the founding took away gun rights from those who were believed to be a threat, not just convicted of certain crimes. “History is consistent with common sense: it demonstrates that legislatures have the power to prohibit dangerous people from possessing guns. But that power extends only to people who are dangerous,” she wrote.\\n\\nFounding-era legislatures imposed restrictions on civic rights such as voting and jury service, Barrett wrote, “not to individual rights like the right to possess a gun.”\\n\\nIn June, Barrett was the lone dissenter when a panel of her court upheld an order that blocked the Trump administration’s new “public charge” rule, which makes it more difficult for noncitizens to receive a green card if future public assistance will be needed.\\n\\nTwo judges on the panel upheld a lower court’s ruling that said the administration had exceeded its authority under the statute.\\n\\nBarrett said that was wrong and that Congress amended the law in 1996 to “increase the bite of the public charge determination.” The challengers disagreed with the administration’s choices, Barrett said, but “litigation is not the vehicle for resolving policy disputes.”\\n\\nLess than a year after Barrett began her service on the federal bench, the moderate Justice Anthony M. Kennedy retired, and Trump seriously considered Barrett as a replacement. Privately, she was relieved when the president instead nominated Brett M. Kavanaugh, according to Silberman.\\n\\n“She said she thought Brett was the better choice,” Silberman recalled, saying Barrett knew “she had nowhere near as much experience on the court of appeals as he did.” Barrett’s remarks, he said, show that she is “unlike most of us, not ruthlessly ambitious.”\\n\\nNow, with almost three years of experience as a judge, she is preparing for another round of hearings on her qualifications and the possibility that she could spend decades on the Supreme Court.\\n\\nIf confirmed, she would return to the place where she was guided by Scalia, and potentially shift the institution in the opposite direction of the person she would replace, Ginsburg. She would serve with the same chief justice, Roberts, whom she criticized in two cases upholding Obamacare — and might be involved in deciding the fate of the Trump administration’s challenge to that program.\\n\\nIn the 2015 radio interview in which she spelled out her disagreement with Roberts, Barrett also alluded to the difficulty of assessing where a justice will end up on the philosophical scale.\\n\\n“I think that the chief justice, when he was appointed, many thought he would be very, very conservative,” she said. “And I think he showed himself to be a much more of a moderate.”\"}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/olivia-troye-coronavirus-white-house/2020/09/17/d3f67ede-f8ed-11ea-a510-f57d8ce76e11_story.html', 'Full Text': '“The president’s rhetoric and his own attacks against people in his administration trying to do the work, as well as the promulgation of false narratives and incorrect information of the virus have made this ongoing response a failure,” she said in an interview.\\n\\nTroye is the first Trump administration official who worked extensively on the coronavirus response to forcefully speak out against Trump and his handling of the pandemic. She joins a growing number of former officials, including former national security adviser John Bolton and former defense secretary Jim Mattis, who have detailed their worries about what happened during their time in the administration while declaring that Trump is unfit to be president.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe amount of criticism Trump has faced from former aides is unprecedented in the modern presidency, and it could pose a political risk to his reelection campaign as some of the aides who have spoken out are pressuring other former colleagues to join them.\\n\\nThe White House dismissed Troye as a disgruntled former employee, minimized her role on the task force and disputed her characterization that the pandemic response has not gone well.\\n\\n“Ms. Troye is a former detailee and a career Department of Homeland Security staff member, who is disgruntled that her detail was cut short because she was no longer capable of keeping up with her day-to-day duties,” retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Pence’s national security adviser, said in a statement. “Ms. Troye directly reported to me, and never once during her detail did she ever express any concern regarding the Administration’s response to the Coronavirus to anyone in her chain of command. By not expressing her concerns, she demonstrated an incredible lack of moral courage.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDeputy White House press secretary Judd Deere said Troye’s “assertions have no basis in reality and are flat-out inaccurate” and that “the truth is President Trump always put the well-being of the American people first,” citing the president’s efforts to boost the production of medical equipment, his early recommendations on social distancing and the plan to quickly develop a vaccine for the novel coronavirus.\\n\\nTroye had an inside view of the White House’s pandemic response, which polls show is hurting the president with voters, and her review of the effort is scathing. She said in an interview that she would be skeptical of any vaccine produced ahead of the election because of worries that its release was due to political pressure.\\n\\n“I would not tell anyone I care about to take a vaccine that launches prior to the election,” she said. “I would listen to the experts and the unity in pharma. And I would wait to make sure that this vaccine is safe and not a prop tied to an election.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThough Troye played a behind-the-scenes role during her time in the White House, she was a major participant in the task force’s work, attending and helping to organize “every single meeting” it held from February until July, she said. She worked closely with Pence on the administration’s response, including establishing an agenda for each meeting, preparing the vice president and arranging briefings for him, writing and editing his comments, and dealing with the vice president’s political aides.\\n\\nShe was often pictured sitting against the back wall of the White House Situation Room near Pence in photos posted to social media. Her assistant would send the seating chart to officials across the administration, who in turn would consult with her about the workings of the group and Pence.\\n\\nShe described herself as a lifelong Republican who always voted for the party’s nominee before 2016. Troye said she did not vote for Trump, because she disliked his rhetoric. She declined to say whom she voted for in the last election.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“But I got past it and accepted he was our president,” Troye, 43, said of the election result.\\n\\nTroye said that she worked in the administration because she hoped Trump would morph into a stronger leader after a divisive campaign and that she had respect for other Trump officials, such as Pence.\\n\\n“I still have a lot of respect for the vice president,” she said. “I worked very loyally for him to do everything I could for him. I don’t want this to become a speaking-out-against-him thing.”\\n\\nAsked about Troye’s comments later in the day, Pence said he was very proud of the administration’s performance.\\n\\n“I haven’t read her comments in any detail. But it reads to me like one more disgruntled employee that has decided to play politics during election year,” Pence said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump dismissed her charges Thursday evening. “I have no idea who she is,” he told reporters. “I never met her, to the best of my knowledge. Maybe she was in a room. I have no idea who she is. She doesn’t know me.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe novel coronavirus has infected more than 6.6 million Americans and has killed nearly 200,000 — a toll Troye said has been exacerbated by what she called Trump and his administration’s mishandling of the pandemic and by the conflicting messages he and his top aides have disseminated to Americans on masks, social distancing and other public health precautions.\\n\\nTrump, she said, usually was not focused on the virus but would often “blindside” the task force and administration officials with public comments, such as his support for the drug hydroxychloroquine, his Twitter attack on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over the agency’s guidance on the reopening of schools, his skeptical comments about masks and his public musings about “herd immunity.” Many of his comments were the opposite of what had been discussed in the Situation Room, where task force meetings were often held, and were at odds with scientific recommendations or the administration’s own data, Troye said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe administration, she said, missed months to slow the spread of the virus because the president and other key administration officials refused to embrace masks, even as members of the task force and health officials “repeatedly begged” Trump to do so. Trump allies note that many of the health officials first advised against masks before advising that they be used.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“The mask issue was a critical one. If we would have gotten ahead on that and stressed the importance of it, we could have slowed the spread significantly,” Troye said. “It was detrimental that it became a politicized issue. It still lingers today.”\\n\\nSenior aides to Pence held a contemptuous view of the administration’s scientists and tried to project a far too rosy outlook about the virus with cherry-picked data — and key public health agencies including the CDC were marginalized throughout her tenure, Troye said. Advisers were afraid to express positions contrary to the president’s views because they feared a public denunciation or “that they would be cut out,” she said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“At some point, every single person on the task force has been thrown under the bus in one way or another,” Troye said. “Instead of being focused on the task at hand, people were constantly wondering what was going to drop next or when you’re going to get reprimanded or cut out of a process for speaking out.”\\n\\nTroye said the White House did not quickly resolve problems with coronavirus testing in the early months as the virus spread, though she concedes those hitches were not personally Trump’s fault.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump rarely attended task force meetings and was briefed only on top-level discussions by Pence or the government’s public health officials. When Trump attended one meeting, Troye said, he spoke for 45 minutes about how poorly he was being treated by certain personalities on Fox News.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“He spent more time about who was going to call Fox and yell at them to set them straight than he did on the virus,” she said.\\n\\nTroye said Trump was constantly looking to reopen states and schools — even when others feared that doing so would be unsafe — and would regularly disregard what his advisers suggested.\\n\\n“There were a lot of closed door conversations I have had with a lot of senior people across the administration where they agree with me wholeheartedly,” she said of her assessment of Trump.\\n\\nUrging others to speak\\n\\nWith less than seven weeks until the election, there is a concerted effort by a coterie of former Trump administration officials to push more former aides to speak out, particularly boldface names who can secure national media attention and aides who can tell damaging stories in detail.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe president, for his part, has described many of those critical as “disgruntled former employees” who were not cut out for his administration. Administration officials note that a number of former employees also have praised the president extensively and that the president has overwhelming support in his own party.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome former and current officials say they do not think ex-Washington officials will move many voters in key states. But Miles Taylor — who worked in the Department of Homeland Security between 2017 and 2019, including as chief of staff — said compelling narrators with first-person testimonials can influence voters.\\n\\n“Is the voice of an ex-Trump official going to change millions of votes? No. But if you can change the minds of several tens of thousands of people in swing states, it could absolutely impact the election,” said Taylor, who has formed a Republican anti-Trump group called Republican Political Alliance for Integrity and Reform (REPAIR).\\n\\nTroye is joining the group, and on Thursday afternoon she released a video, through Republican Voters Against Trump, detailing her problems with Trump’s handling of the pandemic.\\n\\nTaylor said it had been difficult to secure marquee names to speak out against the president because “the president has done a very effective job of creating a culture of fear.”\\n\\nAccording to people familiar with their views, those privately critical of Trump include Mattis, former White House chief of staff John F. Kelly, former secretary of state Rex Tillerson, former top economic aide Gary Cohn and former homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. These people, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on behalf of these officials. The former officials either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to discuss their views.\\n\\nKelly is among those most torn about what to do, according to people who have spoken with him. They say he describes the president in derisive terms — as a narcissist who does not understand the military, cares only about his political fortunes and is unqualified to be president. Kelly declined to comment for this article but has told others he is undecided over whether he should speak out more before the election, citing his previous role in the military and his concern about generals speaking out against elected presidents.\\n\\nBeyond the fear of being attacked, there are other reasons that former advisers have not spoken out publicly.\\n\\nSome of them are still staunchly Republican — even if they dislike Trump — and do not want to publicly support Biden. Some, like Nielsen, would have to defend their own roles in some of Trump’s most contentious decisions.\\n\\nTaylor said he is encouraging former officials such as Mattis and Kelly to see that now is the time to end their reticence.\\n\\n“It took longer than it should have for every single one of us,” Taylor said. “All of us, myself included, should have spoken out sooner.”\\n\\nWhy Troye says she stayed\\n\\nTroye said she expects sharp denunciations from former colleagues in the administration and also expects to be denigrated by the White House and the president on Twitter.\\n\\n“Honestly, I am scared,” she said. “I have never done anything like this.”\\n\\nTroye has long had an obscure profile in Washington — working behind the scenes at the Pentagon as a political appointee during the George W. Bush administration and then as a career official at the Homeland Security and Energy departments during the Obama administration before joining the vice president’s office in 2018 as an employee detailed from DHS.\\n\\nTroye said she was disturbed by the president’s handling of myriad issues over two years — most notably his “military dictator, false prophet-like” march to St. John’s Episcopal Church for a photo with the Bible this summer after protesters were cleared from Lafayette Square.\\n\\nThoughts during her tenure of leaving gave way to other considerations, she said. Troye held a key role on the coronavirus task force but also carried out an array of other duties for the vice president, advising him on mass shootings, immigration, hurricanes and some foreign affairs issues, she said. The vice president would sometimes dial her cellphone, Troye said.\\n\\n“I was the 24-hours-on-call person for major events for two years for him in the role,” Troye said.\\n\\nIn private, she said, Pence would say the “right things” in calls to governors and “was in an impossible situation with the president.” Troye also praised a number of the administration’s top health officials.\\n\\nTroye said she and other advisers regularly encountered a desire on the part of the president and his political advisers, along with some senior members of the vice president’s team, to move on from the coronavirus even as thousands were dying and to focus on the economy or the campaign. She was asked by senior Pence aides, she said, to help on an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal that minimized the fears of a second coronavirus wave and touted the administration’s work on the virus as a success story.\\n\\n“It was ludicrous,” she said of the piece, which ran in June. Troye, however, said she helped write it.\\n\\nThere regularly were suggestions from Pence’s top political advisers for his coronavirus remarks “that I could just not support, and it became harder and harder to push back,” Troye said.\\n\\nThese advisers, Troye said, wanted to wind down the task force at the end of April. “In the middle of a pandemic, how could you do that?” she said.\\n\\nShe declined to name these Pence aides publicly but said there was consistent pressure from Pence’s senior officials to focus more on the economy and the reelection campaign. She added that she felt Pence’s top officials often showed derision toward the administration’s medical experts.\\n\\nAsked about her own regrets, Troye said that she wished she had spoken out internally more often and that she had wrestled with many “sleepless nights” about her actions and time in the administration.\\n\\n“I wished I had been more aggressive in fighting internal forces that were working against the CDC and other policies for the president’s personal agenda,” she said. “I wish I would have been more aggressive with the staff on the vice president’s team and some of the president’s staff.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2020/09/10/portland-protesters-federal-response-trump/', 'Full Text': 'Warning: This graphic requires JavaScript.

It skittered across Hacker’s feet, head and torso for more than 45 seconds. Suddenly, an unmarked van pulled in front of him. Doors slid open. Heavily armed men in camouflage tactical gear surrounded Hacker and took him into custody.\\n\\nHacker, 36, is among nearly two dozen people arrested but not charged during the Trump administration’s five-week response, from July through early August, to the demonstrations against police brutality in Portland. Before letting Hacker go, federal agents collected a DNA swab, photographed him and confiscated a phone that has not been returned, he said.\\n\\nThe Washington Post conducted an in-depth examination of four instances when unsuspecting people were scooped up from the city’s streets by federal agents in the middle of the night, based on information that turned out to be inaccurate or insufficient to charge them with a crime. The cases bring to light the tactics employed by border agents and immigration officers deployed to Portland for an operation President Trump has touted as a success.\\n\\nOperation Diligent Valor has become a prominent issue in the presidential campaign. Trump has said his law-and-order approach is necessary to stop vandalism and property damage during protests in Portland and elsewhere. Activists and some Democrats have portrayed it as an unnecessary escalation.\\n\\nThe shooting death of a man after confrontations on Aug. 29 in Portland between Trump supporters and Black Lives Matter protesters intensified the divide. The next day, Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said the administration was open to sending federal officers back into Portland, over the opposition of local officials.\\n\\nFrom detention to release, the four people whose cases were examined by The Post described experiences they found harrowing and unnerving. Three are speaking for the first time.\\n\\nOne was picked up and interrogated in an unmarked van, she said, and then dropped off in another location in the city. Two others, including Hacker, said they were held in jail cells before being let go without explanation or charges. Another, a U.S. citizen like the other three, was mistakenly identified as a foreigner and arrested on charges that were later dropped.\\n\\nPreviously unpublished security camera footage and other videos obtained by The Post confirmed elements of each person’s account. The examination also drew on videos from bystanders, interviews with witnesses and court records.\\n\\nThe U.S. attorney’s office in Oregon said 23 of 98 arrests by federal agents during the operation did not result in charges.\\n\\nThe office would not name the 23 people, making it impossible to judge how complete the tally is. Kevin Sonoff, a spokesman, said the office considered someone arrested if they “were detained for any amount of time” and “weren’t free to go for whatever reason.” Under that definition, all the cases examined by The Post would qualify as arrests.\\n\\nSonoff said that as part of their routine process, federal prosecutors reviewed evidence in each case to determine whether charges were warranted.\\n\\n“Our office works closely with law enforcement to review the facts surrounding each arrest,” he wrote in an email. “Based upon that discussion and an assessment of potential federal charges, prosecutors accept or decline cases using their best professional judgment as to whether a case should proceed to court.”\\n\\nA Department of Homeland Security spokesman, Harry Fones, said in a statement to The Post that “when federal law enforcement has probable cause that someone has committed a federal crime they are able to detain and investigate.”\\n\\nIn Hacker’s case, the DHS spokesman acknowledged that Customs and Border Protection agents detained Hacker because they believed he matched the description of someone suspected of aiding a protester who threw a firecracker at a federal officer. “Upon further investigation and coordination with the U.S. Attorney’s office, a decision was made not to pursue charges against Mr. Hacker,” the spokesman said.\\n\\nHacker, whose live-stream videos earlier in the night show him documenting the protests but not participating, denied the allegation and called the explanation “laughable.”\\n\\nThe U.S. attorney’s office and DHS declined to comment on the other three cases.\\n\\nThe other three people who shared their accounts with The Post also denied doing anything illegal.\\n\\nThe death of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer put his knee on Floyd’s neck in late May led to scattered protests across Portland, a city with a history of demonstrations for liberal causes.\\n\\nBut the arrival of DHS agents in early July re-energized the protests, channeling ire toward federal authorities and turning the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse into the epicenter of unrest.\\n\\nEach night, even as most of the city fell silent, longtime activists and new protesters gathered around the one-block building in a show of force. Federal agents emerged regularly to fire tear gas and clashed with people suspected of throwing projectiles, shining lasers at officers or shooting fireworks at the building.\\n\\nEvelyn Bassi, 30, a lifelong Portland resident, began attending nightly protests in early June. A bartender and chef who hasn’t been able to work during the pandemic, Bassi said she came to the courthouse in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.\\n\\nOn July 15, around 1:55 a.m., she and a friend, Ryan Ottomano, were standing at an empty intersection behind the courthouse, video shows. They were watching protesters chalk messages on the pavement, she said, and were preparing to go home.\\n\\nA dark gray Dodge Grand Caravan with tinted windows pulled up next to them, according to security camera footage of the intersection obtained by The Post from Multnomah County, which owns a nearby building.\\n\\n“That’s when I was like, ‘Oh, no. They’re here for us,’ ” said Ottomano, 29.\\n\\nThe van’s front and side doors on the passenger side opened as it rolled to a stop, Bassi said.\\n\\n“I noticed that there were people in camo,” she said. “I threw my hands up and said, ‘We’re leaving, we’re leaving,’ like, ‘We’re not causing any trouble.’ ”\\n\\nFearful and unsure who the men were, Bassi and Ottomano said, they ran. The van followed them for half a block before making a U-turn to pursue Bassi, who had turned to run back toward the courthouse, video shows.\\n\\nAfter the van caught up, two officers in camouflage tactical gear with “POLICE” patches across their chests approached Bassi. She turned to face them with her hands up. “I haven’t done anything at all,” she repeated, according to video by a witness.\\n\\nThe agents held Bassi’s arms behind her back and escorted her to the van. She was ordered to sit cross-legged on the floor of the vehicle — its middle seats removed — with her hands on her helmet and her eyes down, she said. They began to drive through downtown.\\n\\nA pair of agents in the front and two more in the back were quiet, Bassi recalled.\\n\\n“They never said who they were,” Bassi said. “I didn’t know if I was going to be seen again. I didn’t know what was going on. But I could tell that I was being arrested or detained or something.”\\n\\nAn officer asked whether Bassi, whose helmet covered her hair, was blond, she recalled.\\n\\n“No,” she said.\\n\\nThe van made frequent turns for five to 10 minutes, until the agents stopped at a quiet intersection seven blocks from where Bassi had been picked up, she said.\\n\\nFollowing officers’ orders, she climbed out and put her hands on the van’s roof, she said. An agent frisked her and asked her whether she had a laser pointer, she said. She told him she did not.\\n\\n“You’re being detained because you match the description of somebody who committed a federal crime against an officer,” the agent said, according to Bassi, who is transgender.\\n\\nAs they removed her helmet and a cap underneath it, her brunette hair fell down.\\n\\n“That’s not him,” an officer said, according to Bassi.\\n\\nAnother held up a grainy cellphone photo of the man they sought, Bassi recalled. It showed a person wearing a face covering and a gray bicycle helmet that bore little resemblance to her black helmet, she said.\\n\\n“ My anxiety is very rampant. … I have night terrors and nightmares every single night. ” — Evelyn Bassi, detained on July 15\\n\\n(Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)\\n\\nAn agent told Bassi she was free to go but left her with a warning, she said: “You know, bro, we have cameras everywhere.”\\n\\nBlocks away and 30 minutes after Bassi’s detention, Mark Pettibone was leaving the protest with a friend.\\n\\nPettibone, a 30-year-old Arizona native who completed a master’s degree at Portland’s Reed College in 2018, had made a point to attend the protests two to three nights a week while juggling a full-time job at a grocery store, he said.\\n\\nThat night, Pettibone had listened to Black Lives Matter speakers in the park across from the courthouse and tossed a Frisbee with friends, he said. But as Pettibone and his friend left, walking two blocks northwest of the courthouse on SW Main Street, a group of protesters warned that they had seen “unmarked vans kind of patrolling the perimeter,” Pettibone said.\\n\\nAt 2:33 a.m., security camera footage obtained by The Post shows Pettibone, wearing a beanie, glasses and a backpack, walking on SW Main Street toward SW 5th Avenue with his friend, Conner O’Shea.\\n\\nSoon after, a van pulled up, and “four or five military-fatigues-clad people jumped out,” Pettibone said.\\n\\nPettibone ran.\\n\\n“This is an unmarked van,” he said. “No one knows who these people are. … And I feared for my life.”\\n\\nSecurity camera footage shows Pettibone running around the corner at SW Main and SW Broadway around 2:35 a.m., with the van following seconds later. He said he was detained shortly after. He knelt on the sidewalk, his hands above his head, and repeatedly asked the officers, “Why?” he said. There was no answer, he said.\\n\\nPettibone has previously shared his account with media outlets and members of Congress. But the security camera footage obtained by The Post is the first visual evidence showing the unmarked van pursuing him. It was provided by Portland’5 Centers for the Arts, which owns a theater across the street from where Pettibone was taken into custody.\\n\\nLike Bassi, Pettibone said he was told to sit on the van floor as he held his hands on his head. An agent pulled his beanie cap down over his eyes, he said. Video from Multnomah County shows a van similar to the one that pursued Pettibone arriving near the courthouse at 2:37 a.m., about four blocks from where Pettibone was detained.\\n\\nIn the courthouse garage, Pettibone said, officers stood him against a wall and took photos from different angles. They escorted him to a holding area on an upper floor, he said, where an officer dumped out the contents of his bag without his consent.\\n\\n“This is a whole lot of nothing,” Pettibone recalled the officer saying, as hand sanitizer and an inhaler spilled out.\\n\\nPettibone said officers put him in a cell and asked whether he would waive his right to remain silent; he said no. He was given no explanation for his detention, he said. He remained there for two hours, he said, until an officer told him he could leave.\\n\\nPettibone said the experience was “surreal.”\\n\\nWord of federal agents’ actions quickly spread, sparking outrage.\\n\\nThe video of Bassi’s detention circulated on social media, gaining nearly 13 million views, although she has not disclosed her identity until now.\\n\\nIn response to the video at the time, U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a statement acknowledging its officers had taken an unnamed person into custody because they “had information indicating the person in the video was suspected of assaults against federal agents or destruction of federal property.”\\n\\nBassi said she did not assault an agent and did nothing illegal.\\n\\nIn Washington, Trump praised the federal response.\\n\\n“Portland was very rough, and they called us in, and we did a good job, to put it mildly,” he said on July 15 at the White House, the day that Bassi and Pettibone had been taken into custody in the early morning. “Many people in jail right now.”\\n\\nOfficials in Oregon did not see it that way. The state’s attorney general, Ellen Rosenblum, sued the Department of Homeland Security on July 17. “We are today asking the federal court to stop the federal police from secretly stopping and forcibly grabbing Oregonians off our streets,” Rosenblum said at the time.\\n\\nThe suit accused federal officers of violating protesters’ rights and Oregon’s sovereignty. It also sought an order restraining federal agents from making arrests without warrants and requiring them to identify themselves and the reason for any detention. A federal judge denied the request, ruling that the state didn’t have a strong enough interest to sue on behalf of protesters.\\n\\n“ It seemed, at least from my personal experience, it seemed completely indiscriminate. It could’ve been anyone. ” — Mark Pettibone, arrested on July 15\\n\\n(Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)\\n\\nFederal agents were waiting for Tawasi as he drove home early on the morning of July 24 after a night of attending the protests at the courthouse. Tawasi, a Portland resident whose name is Native American, does not have a surname.\\n\\nAs Tawasi’s car approached the building where he lives at 2:33 a.m., an SUV carrying federal agents idled at a nearby loading dock, according to a phone recording of security video from a business that owns the property. The SUV pulled in front of Tawasi’s car, as other vehicles pulled in behind, lights flashing, video shows. Agents in plainclothes with guns drawn converged on Tawasi’s car and removed him, he said.\\n\\n“We got you, Mr. Hickey,” an agent who identified himself as part of Homeland Security Investigations said, according to Tawasi.\\n\\n“You definitely got me. But I am not Mr. Hickey. I have no idea who that is,” Tawasi, 44, said he responded.\\n\\nTawasi, a delivery driver who also works as a far-left video blogger, was at a loss. He had been attending protests two to three times a week, but he told The Post he is a pacifist.\\n\\nDuring Tawasi’s arrest, agents informed him he was facing charges under a statute that prohibits releasing federal agents’ personal information, such as a Social Security number or home address, in order to threaten, intimidate or incite violence against them, he said.\\n\\nTawasi later learned the charge stemmed from his social media posts. He had published a photo on Twitter on July 12 of what he believed were two federal agents outside a Portland hotel. In subsequent posts, Tawasi called on protesters to make noise outside the hotel so that the “federal goons,” as he called the agents, could not sleep, and he urged hotel workers to deny the agents service.\\n\\n“I wasn’t encouraging people to throw grenades or shoot tear gas or bullets or hit with batons,” Tawasi said in an interview. “I was encouraging people to, like, use air horns or sirens or just noise-making devices to, you know, just to disrupt the normal course of business.”\\n\\nThe protest Tawasi called for never materialized, but his posts prompted federal agents to monitor his social media accounts and eventually to surveil him at the protest on the night of his arrest, court records show.\\n\\nFor unexplained reasons, investigators initially believed Tawasi was a Canadian national with a name of Hickey, court records show. A then-sealed warrant secured on the day of his arrest identified him as Tawasi, “a/k/a Ronald Bernard Hickey,” according to court records.\\n\\nTawasi, a U.S. citizen, told The Post he has never been to Canada and didn’t know anyone with that name.\\n\\nRecords show Tawasi has been registered to vote under his name in several states where he has lived over the past two decades. His Oregon driver’s license lists his name as Tawasi, court records show. And his social media accounts all carry that name.\\n\\nThe U.S. attorney’s office in Oregon and DHS declined to comment on the case or why they identified him as Hickey.\\n\\nAfter his arrest, Tawasi was held in the courthouse jail for more than 12 hours, until his first court appearance the following afternoon. During that hearing, the judge said prosecutors intended to charge Tawasi with illegally entering the United States, in addition to the charge based on his tweets, according to a transcript.\\n\\n“Mr. Tawasi is alleged to be a citizen of Canada. He is also alleged to be here without permission, and he is also alleged to have a different name other than Tawasi; specifically, by the last name of Hickey,” said Magistrate Judge John V. Acosta.\\n\\nA news release issued by the Department of Justice two days later also referred to Tawasi as a Canadian national with the alias.\\n\\nThe federal government soon began to backpedal. The illegal-reentry charge did not materialize, court records show. The Justice Department’s news release was corrected to say that Tawasi had been “incorrectly identified” as Hickey. And less than two weeks later, the charges of releasing agents’ personal information were dropped at federal prosecutors’ request “in the interest of justice,” court filings state.\\n\\nFederal agents never returned Tawasi’s phone, though, he said.\\n\\nHe provided The Post with screen shots of Google tracking data that he had enabled on his Samsung Galaxy S6 showing the phone’s movements during the 32 hours after his arrest. Tawasi accessed the data by logging on to his Google account from a computer. It showed the phone was transported to several buildings in downtown Portland, including the federal courthouse and an Internal Revenue Service office before it was taken to a residential neighborhood in Lake Oswego, 10 miles south of Portland, the data shows.\\n\\nThen the tracking data stopped, indicating the phone was no longer on or its tracking function was disabled.\\n\\nCourt records in Tawasi’s criminal case do not show a search warrant.\\n\\n[DHS compiled ‘intelligence reports’ on journalists]\\n\\nSpokesmen for DHS and the U.S. attorney’s office declined to comment on the phone’s movement or to elaborate on whether investigators had obtained a warrant for it.\\n\\n“ That feeling of being inside of a cell and not having any contact with anyone and not having a phone number to call for a lawyer. … That was probably my most terrified hour. ” — Tawasi, arrested on July 24\\n\\n(Andrew Hinton for The Washington Post)\\n\\nHacker’s arrest on July 29 capped a month of unrest outside the courthouse.\\n\\nHacker, who completed a master’s degree in criminology and criminal justice from Portland State University this past spring, attended the protests most nights.\\n\\nA self-described citizen-journalist, he records videos of protests and rallies to expose what he views as excessive police force and information “that contradicts police statements,” he said. He considers himself an anti-fascist but said he is not part of any group affiliated with antifa, the loosely knit far-left movement.\\n\\nHacker is well-known among activists along the political spectrum in Portland.\\n\\nWhile recording a far-right rally in Portland in 2017, he was charged by a DHS officer with not obeying a lawful order to leave. Videos played at trial contradicted parts of an officer’s testimony, according to media reports. A federal judge later acquitted Hacker, court records show.\\n\\nThe conservative activist and journalist Andy Ngo sued Hacker and several other people earlier this year, alleging they harassed him over his unfavorable coverage of antifa. In the lawsuit, Ngo alleged Hacker grabbed his phone out of his hands during a confrontation at a gym last year. Hacker, who has not formally responded to the allegations in court, declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation.\\n\\nIn the hours before his arrest on July 29, Hacker streamed 77 minutes of video showing the protests and police response. He calmly narrated the night’s events, describing the actions of protesters and federal agents, according to a review of the footage.\\n\\nHacker was standing beside Jake Johnson, another citizen-journalist, in Lownsdale Square. The park was mostly quiet and empty, when both noticed the green laser coming from the balcony, they said. Hacker initially thought it was a prank intimidation tactic, he said. But Johnson quickly grew alarmed, video shows.\\n\\n“Is this a joke?” Johnson shouted on a video as the laser targeted Hacker at 3:41 a.m. “This is, uh … not great.”\\n\\nTwo unmarked vans arrived seconds later, videos show.\\n\\n“You have the wrong target,” Johnson yelled. “You have the wrong target.”\\n\\nA Border Patrol agent in fatigues stepped out of a white, unmarked van and took Hacker into custody, video shows.\\n\\nHacker said he asked why he was being arrested, but the agent was silent.\\n\\nIn a video from a bystander, the agent can be seen taking Hacker’s phone and putting it atop the white van, as agents prepare to transport Hacker to the courthouse.\\n\\nInside the building, Hacker said, officers took cellphone photos of him. An agent placed a sticker on his right back shoulder, before taking a photo from behind, Hacker said. Hacker said he could not see the sticker.\\n\\nHacker was placed in a cell. He said agents asked to take his fingerprints, but he told them his fingers had been partially amputated, an injury suffered during a traffic accident years ago. Agents then asked to take a DNA swab from his cheek, and he allowed that, he said.\\n\\nHacker asked two more times why he was under arrest, he said.\\n\\n“We’re working on it,” he said he was told.\\n\\nMore than an hour passed before an agent opened the cell and escorted Hacker toward a building exit. “We’ve done an investigation, determined you’ve committed no crime,” he said the agent told him.\\n\\nSecurity camera footage shows Hacker emerging from the courthouse at 5:09 a.m.\\n\\n[DHS official whose office compiled ‘intelligence reports’ on journalists and protesters has been removed]\\n\\nOnly after he was on the street, he said, did he realize his Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus cellphone — on which he had no tracking apps enabled — was missing.\\n\\nHe said his cellphone still has not been returned.\\n\\n“ It definitely has impacted my ability to document in a way that really shows what’s going on because there’s that constant fear around keeping, you know, extra distance from what’s going on. ” — John Hacker, arrested on July 29\\n\\n(Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)\\n\\nAll four people said their experiences linger with them, causing anxiety, paranoia and fear.\\n\\n“I can’t be alone,” Bassi said.\\n\\nPettibone, who sued Trump and DHS officials late last month, has stopped going to the protests as frequently. “It makes you more paranoid,” he said.\\n\\n“Now, when I’m driving somewhere, I don’t just take it for granted that I’m going to be able to get home,” Tawasi said.\\n\\nHacker continues to document protests but has become more skittish. “There’s that constant fear around keeping, you know, extra distance from what’s going on,” he said.\\n\\nAlice Crites contributed to this report.\\n\\nFollow @wpinvestigates on Twitter | Latest investigative news'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/24/seasonal-farm-workers-coronavirus/', 'Full Text': 'At the height of harvest season, growers supplying some of America’s biggest agricultural companies and grocery store chains flouted public health guidelines to limit testing and obscure coronavirus outbreaks, according to thousands of pages of state and local records reviewed by The Washington Post.\\n\\nAt the same time, state agencies and growers were slow to determine how and when to test workers, what protocols to adopt when workers tested positive, and how to institute contact tracing, advocates say. They say that there should have been mandatory personal protective equipment and clear guidance on worker safety at the federal and state levels.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWorker advocates say the failures put millions of workers at greater risk of contracting and spreading the virus among themselves and to other Americans as they crossed state lines to move with the harvest season.\\n\\nThe struggles to contain the virus among migrant farmworkers are documented in internal state and county agriculture and health department records, as well as email exchanges with farm bureaus, grower associations, and public health and worker advocacy groups that were obtained by the Documenting COVID-19 project at Columbia University’s Brown Institute for Media Innovation through public records requests and shared with The Post. These documents and additional interviews by The Post show a pattern that extended across more than a dozen agricultural counties in 10 states — and that largely withstood officials’ attempts to stop the spread of the virus among agricultural workers.\\n\\n“If this is an essential industry, why is it we can’t at least take the kind of steps needed to figure out where we need to do interventions?” asked Don Villarejo, a former researcher at the California Institute for Rural Studies who has been analyzing coronavirus data on farmworkers. “My mantra is that all pandemics are local; if you don’t track every aspect of people’s lives including where they work and where they live, then you can never do a proper intervention.\"\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the nature of America’s migrant labor system, which relies on approximately 220,000 workers on seasonal H-2A work visas and another estimated 1.5 million undocumented workers largely from Mexico and other Latin American countries, leaves workers with few protections and exposed to the virus, advocates say.\\n\\nPlanting, harvesting and packing produce typically put farmworkers in proximity with co-workers. Laborers often rely on employers for transport, usually in vans and buses, and accommodation in crowded, camp-style housing, according to Ed Kissam, a former California farm labor researcher who has been tracking the impact of the coronavirus on farmworker communities. And workers’ very transience, harvesting six weeks here and eight weeks there, presents problems for tracing and disincentives for local governments to invest in solutions; wait long enough and seasonal workers become someone else’s problem.\\n\\nThe effects of the coronavirus frequently overlay a system in which growers have routinely failed to protect workers while on the job — offering them substandard transportation, housing and access to health care and testing, Kissam said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Virtually all are housed in congregate living situations, making them extremely vulnerable to covid-19 transmission,” he said. “Typically, 40 to 80 percent of the people living in crowded living quarters — congregate housing or individual crowded housing — will be infected by others they live with once the infection is introduced from workplace or community infection.”\\n\\nTracking the spread of the coronavirus among farmworkers is further complicated by language barriers and worker mistrust of authorities, Villarejo said. In addition, farm laborers are often afraid to get tested for fear of being deported, losing their jobs or of being left with large hospital bills.\\n\\nUsing Monterey County’s official coronavirus dashboard, Villarejo found that as of July 1, agricultural workers in the county had 1,410 positive cases per 100,000 population, about three times the rate for other workers, which was 455 cases per 100,000. He said he anticipates the prevalence among farmworkers has increased substantially since then.\\n\\nThe Department of Agricultural Economics at Purdue University, in collaboration with Microsoft, estimates 128,000 farmworkers nationwide have tested positive for the coronavirus, as of Sept. 24. But Jayson Lusk, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue, says their dashboard could be a dramatic undercount as it does not include part-time and temporary workers.\\n\\nBy comparison, 42,988 meatpacking workers have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in 498 meat plants as of Sept. 24, according to an analysis by the Food and Environment Reporting Network, a nonprofit investigative news organization. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued detailed reports on coronavirus outbreaks in meatpacking plants, the agency has no immediate plans to monitor infections among farmworkers. “At this time we are not tracking outbreaks in farmworkers or on farms,” CDC spokeswoman Jasmine Reed said in July.\\n\\nEleven states (California, Colorado, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin) have introduced mandatory protections for farmworkers during the pandemic that include providing PPE and requiring physical distancing, workplace disinfection and worker testing. Many issued recommendations only after seeing significant outbreaks among farmworkers in their states. Twenty states have issued nonenforceable guidance, and 19 states, including Florida and Texas, have issued no recommendations.\\n\\nIn early May, Washington state’s Yakima County, one of the nation’s biggest suppliers of sweet cherries, apples and pears, had the highest case rate on the West Coast, and state officials urged several farms experiencing outbreaks to test all employees. Yet growers resisted widespread coronavirus testing, according to internal emails between Yakima Health District chief executive Ryan Ibach and Environmental Health Director Shawn Magee.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Our people aren’t interested in being tested,” Jeannette Evans, owner of Evans Fruit, one of the biggest apple orchards in the state, told The Washington Post, adding that health officials “didn’t like it because an old lady stood up to them.” She said her workers are “good Spanish people,” many of whom have worked for the farm for years.\\n\\nEvans was blunt when Magee inquired about testing by email, a certified letter and phone calls between June 4 and June 17.\\n\\n“She said we are not to enter her properties and will not participate in site visits or testing … then [she] hung up on me,” Magee wrote. Magee told The Washington Post he reported Evans Fruit to the state labor department, which enforces workplace safety rules.\\n\\nEvans, who began farming in 1949 with her late husband, told The Post only 10 of her workers had been infected with the virus by mid-July. However, Yakima Health District records of coronavirus cases among her farmworkers showed 72 positive cases out of a workforce of 350 people across three locations as of Aug. 12.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn July 13, Evans allowed health officials to inspect the farms. They found workers wearing masks incorrectly, no hand-washing stations outside the bathrooms and no daily health screenings of employees, public records show. The Yakima Health District report said: “Received anonymous complaint from worker on day of consultation that they were being told to wear a mask because of the inspection even though they had not been wearing one for 4 months.”\\n\\nThe Yakima Health District set up a free testing site across from the Evans Fruit location in Cowiche, “as they have a very high case count of covid-19,″ Magee wrote in a July 23 email. “Only one employee out of over 300 showed up for testing.”\\n\\nSome farms tried to minimize the extent of coronavirus outbreaks among their workers. Other farms asked health officials to attribute outbreaks to other units of their company. According to Yakima Health District internal emails, Allan Bros. has had 42 cases of coronavirus among its workers as of Aug. 12. The company requested that a subset of cases be listed instead under the name Sagemoor Group Management Services, the company’s vineyard.\\n\\nAllen Bros. did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\n***\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFlorida’s spring harvest made the state the earliest test ground for vulnerabilities among fruit and vegetable pickers. Farmworker advocacy groups say county health officials were slow to grasp the spread of infection and fatalities in farmworker populations, in part because hospital officials and medical examiners did not consistently collect data by occupation or race.\\n\\nThe medical examiner’s office for the heavily agricultural Lee, Hendry and Glades counties identified only four deaths in the Hispanic racial group in March and April, despite many Hispanic surnames among the list of dead. The counties recorded 188 coronavirus deaths between March 5 and July 16.\\n\\nWhen asked why race/ethnicity and occupation are not tracked, the medical examiner’s office for Lee, Hendry and Glades counties said in a statement: “The information entered into the medical examiner’s database is based on information the medical examiner’s office receives from the reporters of the death.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAdvocates say Hispanics were also undercounted in neighboring Collier County, a heavily agricultural area. By the end of May, Immokalee, a farming community in the county, had more than 1,000 positive cases, one of the highest infection rates in the state, according to state health department statistics.\\n\\n“Since we have been using the medical examiner’s data to confirm known individuals who have died, we know that just about everyone we’ve confirmed in Immokalee is in fact Indigenous Mayan or Latino, but they are listed as White,” said Marley Monacello, a staff member with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers.\\n\\nAccording to Gerardo Reyes Chavez, a coalition leader, the organization wrote to the Collier County Board of County Commissioners on March 23 and to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and 14 others on April 2, laying out the risks to farmworkers. There was no response from the governor or board; they heard back only from a staff member of one state representative, Monacello said.\\n\\n“Nearly every suggestion we gave about how to meet the needs of the farmworker community — from early community-wide testing, to effective health education, the need for contact tracing and isolation areas apart from overcrowded housing — was met with initial rejection and delay,” Reyes Chavez said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“The Governor’s Office receives correspondence from dozens of groups and organizations daily. Responding to each and every one is simply not feasible,” the governor’s press secretary, Cody McCloud, said in an email. “The DeSantis Administration has supported Florida’s farmworkers throughout the covid-19 pandemic.\"\\n\\nCounty commissioner Bill McDaniel Jr. says a lack of testing has been less of a problem than the county’s ability to deal with positive cases, which he said frequently hinges on a worker’s documentation status.\\n\\n“If they test positive, they know they are staring at quarantining and self-isolation and they need to have that paycheck,” he said. “We’ve had 300 people slip back to whatever crack they came from, off to parts unknown. They don’t give the right phone number or the right address.”\\n\\nCollier County health officials twice turned down offers from Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit health-care organization, to conduct contact tracing in Immokalee, according to Matthew Hing, a doctor with the organization that has had success in contact tracing in Massachusetts.\\n\\nKristine Hollingsworth, public information officer for the Florida Department of Health in Collier County, said the offers were declined because any group that assisted in contact-tracing efforts would need to become a background-screened volunteer of the agency or a contracted agency approved by the Florida Department of Health.\\n\\nTesting of farmworkers did not ramp up until June. By that time, much of the Florida growing season was over and many seasonal farmworkers were on the move.\\n\\n“By then the state had successfully sent the problem up north,” said Robin Lewy of the Rural Women’s Health Project. “It was shushed and covered up. We didn’t think about the farmworkers because it’s convenient to forget them.”\\n\\n***\\n\\nIn California, some growers threatened to retaliate against workers who complained about a lack of masks and other PPE or overcrowding in hotels, according to emails between the Monterey County Health Department and advocacy groups. A. Irene de Barraicua, a spokesperson for Lideres Campesinas, a California women’s farmworker network, says very few workers want to be publicly identified because “they are scared of retaliation, of losing work and of being deported.

On May 11, CAUSE filed an unfair labor practice charge with the California Agricultural Labor Relations Board on behalf of the workers, alleging that the company fired some of the striking workers and threatened to call immigration officials, Davalos said.\\n\\nThe Agricultural Labor Relations Board is investigating complaints that Rancho Laguna Farms laid off workers who complained, according to Franchesca Herrera, the board’s regional director.\\n\\nLike many smaller strawberry growers in Santa Maria, Rancho Laguna Farms sells its fruit to Driscoll’s, which controls about one-third of the $6 billion U.S. berry market.\\n\\n“We cannot comment on any ongoing and pending investigations,” said Rancho Laguna Farms spokesman Jesse Rojas by email.

But they may be feeling it now. When it’s almost too late.\\n\\nAccording to a new Post-ABC News poll, a majority of the country (57 percent) agrees with Democrats that the seat vacated by Ruth Bader Ginsburg should be filled by the winner of November’s election; 38 percent say it should be filled right now by President Trump.\\n\\nAnd then there’s this:\\n\\nThere could be some ambiguity in those answers; for instance, you might say it makes no difference because you already thought the election of your candidate was of infinite importance and therefore couldn’t get more important. But it’s still unusual to see more Democrats than Republicans cite the opening on the court as inflating the importance of their vote.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPerhaps this is happening because the last time there was a liberal majority on the court, Richard Nixon was president. So despite the occasional important victory in the time since when one or another conservative justice came over to their side, liberals have been suffering defeats at the court for so long that many may never have felt they had that much to lose.\\n\\nNow, of course, they do. A 5-4 conservative majority where from time to time one of the Republican appointees joins with the Democratic appointees to deliver a partial victory (such as upholding most of the Affordable Care Act) or even a substantial one (such as legalizing same-sex marriage) is very different from a 6-3 conservative majority, which could make liberal victories all but nonexistent.\\n\\nAs someone who has constantly tried to get liberals to realize the importance of the Supreme Court (see here or here), I’m heartened that Democrats are finally realizing what the stakes are. Unfortunately, it comes at a time when defeat is almost inevitable; while there are a few procedural moves Senate Democrats can make to slow the process down, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is determined to move Trump’s nominee through the process in a matter of weeks, and there’s almost nothing that will stop him.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt’s particularly important to President Trump himself, who has essentially said that his nominee must be on the court so she can help him steal the election.\\n\\nEven if that doesn’t happen, the future is looking pretty miserable. Pick your issue — reproductive rights, civil rights, voting rights, workers’ rights, climate change — and chances are that in the next few years, the Supreme Court will issue rulings about it that horrify and enrage you.\\n\\nThat will be true no matter what happens in this election. But in a Biden administration — or in any Democratic administration in the near future — lawsuits will move to the center of Republican legislative strategy. Every significant piece of Democratic legislation will be challenged in court by Republicans, safe in the knowledge that the Supreme Court is their ace in the hole.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe arguments they make against health-care reform or immigration reform or action on climate change when the bills are being debated will be merely setting the table for the conservative majority on the Supreme Court to take its sledgehammer to the Democratic legislation, no matter what Congress wants or what the public wants.\\n\\nTo be clear, that doesn’t mean things couldn’t be worse. If Trump is reelected, there’s a reasonable chance that Justice Stephen G. Breyer — who will be 86 years old by the end of the next presidential term — will step down because of illness or age. That would give conservatives a 7-2 majority on the court, and who knows how many decades it would be before liberals find themselves in the majority again.\\n\\nWith six conservatives, let alone seven, the coming right-wing rampage across the landscape of the law will make it hard for anyone to forget how important the Supreme Court is. It’s just too bad that’s what it will take to open everyone’s eyes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/28/if-democrats-win-they-should-move-quickly-help-postal-service/', 'Full Text': 'Republicans also believe that most Americans share this general perspective on government. But it isn’t true.\\n\\nHere’s an example, one that not only shows the American public’s secret socialist leanings, it presents an opportunity for Democrats, should they prevail in November’s elections, to enact broad reform that could have a positive effect on millions of Americans’ lives.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA new Post/University of Maryland poll finds that by a more than 2-to-1 margin, Americans reject the idea that the Postal Service should be “run like a business”:\\n\\nInstead, most said the Postal Service should be run as a “public service,” even if doing so would cost the government money. That belief was more prevalent among Democrats (82 percent) and independents (69 percent). Republicans were evenly divided, with 49 percent saying it should be run as a public service and 51 percent choosing the business option, “even if that limits the services it provides.”\\n\\nThat’s one way to describe the trade-offs; you might get a slightly different result if you asked the question a different way. But the point is that the public overwhelmingly believes that the Postal Service, which remains the most popular agency in the federal government, should have public service as its guiding principle.\\n\\nAre you perturbed about the slowdown in mail delivery you’ve experienced lately? That’s what happens when you run the Postal Service like a business. Louis DeJoy, the Republican mega-donor recently installed as postmaster general, was brought in to do just that. He has sought to cut costs by limiting overtime and multiple delivery trips, on the hard-nosed business theory that it’s what’s necessary to improve the balance sheet. And nobody is happy about it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs I and many others have pointed out, for some reason nobody suggests that, say, the Department of Defense should be “run like a business” or turn a profit; in that case, the GOP’s position is that we should just fly a daily stream of C-5M Super Galaxy sorties over the Pentagon so they can drop tons of cash on the building.\\n\\nThat’s not to say that there aren’t some things you could do to improve efficiency in the Postal Service; as with any large organization, there surely are. But some of its inefficiencies derive from its public service mission, one most of us are firmly committed to. Unlike its private-sector competitors, it delivers to every address in America, and for the same modest rate. (Go to a FedEx and ask if they’ll deliver a letter for 55 cents, and see what they say.) It operates over 30,000 post offices, many in far-flung locations where doing so costs money. Why? Because every American should be able to get to a post office.\\n\\nIf we wanted, we could ditch that public service mission. We could say that henceforth the Postal Service will operate like a business, which means it will jack up its rates and close down unprofitable post offices. We’ll let the magic of the market take things from there.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAll of us — including Republicans — know what would happen then. There would be a revolt. And, we should note, many of the people hurt most would be those living in rural America, who are overwhelmingly represented by Republicans.\\n\\nIt’s possible that we may look back on this moment and thank President Trump and Louis DeJoy for making it so clear how reliant we are on the Postal Service, and how much Americans love it. That’s because they’ve created an opportunity for some long-overdue reform.\\n\\nIf Joe Biden wins the presidential race and Democrats take back the Senate, they’ll have a lot of things on their legislative plates. A postal bill may not get the attention of adding a public health insurance option or comprehensive immigration reform, but it should be high on the Democrats’ agenda.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat would that reform consist of? Most obviously, eliminating the insane requirement that the Postal Service prepay decades of retiree health benefits, which burdens the agency with billions of dollars in costs every year. That alone would put the Postal Service on a much firmer financial footing.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd it’s something even some Republicans in Congress support. But Democrats ought to go further. They can replace the USPS’s aging fleet of trucks with electric delivery vehicles. They can allow people to access basic banking services through their local post office.\\n\\nThere will never be a better time than this to shore up the Postal Service and enhance its ability to serve the public. Doing so would accomplish progressive goals and, in all likelihood, be extremely popular.

Last week the department began requiring that the boxes of food include a letter from Trump in which he takes credit for the program. “In my 30 years of doing this work, I’ve never seen something this egregious,” said one food bank official\\n\\nRepublicans are struggling to give it credence. It claims that in 2016 Hillary Clinton personally approved a strategy to falsely accuse the Kremlin of aiding the Trump campaign.

Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe declassified a Russian intelligence “analysis” so ridiculous that evenare struggling to give it credence.

This helps obscure the fact that Russia is interfering on Trump’s behalf now, as Trump wants.\\n\\nAnd that’s just what we know about.\\n\\nIt’s crucial to understand that the president and therefore most, if not all, of the people who work for him deny almost none of this. Just as Trump described his attempt to strong-arm a foreign leader into helping his reelection campaign as “perfect,” they believe that it is his right and privilege to turn the government into a subsidiary of the Trump campaign.\\n\\nWhen it’s pointed out that what they’re doing is unethical and in many cases potentially illegal, not only do they not care, they’re pleased.

Which is to say, he expected that McEnany would want to spin the comments, reframe them in a way that didn’t suggest that Trump was embracing a refusal to accede in the event of a loss.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut McEnany is not a typical press secretary, just as Trump is not a typical president.\\n\\n“You are referring to the question asked by the Playboy reporter, right?” McEnany replied. When Karl reiterated his question, McEnany again referred to the questioner’s publication, pointedly emphasizing the word “Playboy.” She then said that the original question reflected the reporter’s “deranged wish” that Trump would leave the White House.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis isn’t a cleanup effort, obviously. Instead, it’s an effort to disparage the question to which Trump was responding, by shaming the men’s magazine for which the reporter worked. Trump’s view of Playboy is not as hostile as McEnany’s response of course, given that he’s appeared on its cover, participated in one of its adult-themed videos and warmly embraced its employees.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It’s a very direct and very simple question,” Karl continued. “If the president loses this election, will this White House, will this president assure us that there will be a peaceful transfer of power?”\\n\\n“The president will accept the results of a free and fair election,” McEnany finally replied. She went on to disparage Democrats as being the ones unlikely to accept the election’s results.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Are the results legitimate only if the president wins?” NBC News’s Peter Alexander asked.\\n\\n“The president will accept the results of a free and fair election,” McEnany replied, emphasizing “free and fair” as robustly as she did “Playboy” a short while earlier. “He will accept the will of the American people.”\\n\\nThis might seem like a successful cleanup of Trump’s remarks. There you go: He’ll accept the election results. Easy-peasy. But it’s impossible not to understand why McEnany emphasized “free and fair” so pointedly, particularly given where the briefing went next.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Yesterday when the president said, ‘Get rid of the ballots. There won’t be a transfer, frankly. There will be a continuation,’ which particular ballots is he talking about wanting to get rid of and why does he think that would help him get elected?” a reporter asked.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“The president wants to get rid of mass mail-out voting,” McEnany replied. “And that’s not because it — he’s said clearly that that could go either way, it could damage either candidate’s chances because it’s a system that’s subject to fraud.”\\n\\nShe went on to outline evidence that she suggested supported that idea — ballots found in a ditch in Wisconsin, inflated voter rolls in Los Angeles, concerns expressed by Attorney General William P. Barr, election results in New Jersey, a study from a commission co-chaired by former president Jimmy Carter.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf any of this sounds familiar, it should. Every claim McEnany made has been debunked, lacks context or doesn’t actually make the point she claims it does. In fact, McEnany trotted all of these examples out just a few hours after we comprehensively walked through nearly all of them. We’re not so vain as to think she reads everything we write, but there’s been enough written about each of these subjects to make clear that mail-in ballots aren’t rife with fraud and, moreover, that the vast majority of votes being cast by mail aren’t of the sort about which Trump offers his objections.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn other words, McEnany with one breath asserted that Trump would of course accept the results of a “free and fair election” — and then, with another, introduced all sorts of untrue reasons the results of the election should a priori be considered suspect. Saying that you’ll accept the results of a fair election as you argue that the election will necessarily be unfair is like joining a tontine and then poisoning the other participants.\\n\\nOr, if you will, like saying that you support legal immigration as you work repeatedly to undercut the legal immigration system.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMcEnany declined to actually “clean up” what Trump said. She just rephrased it. Instead of awkwardly transitioning from “we should get rid of mail-in ballots” to “the election will be fair” the way Trump did, she just buried the connection a little deeper.\\n\\nOn his way to North Carolina a few hours later, Trump made McEnany’s point more explicitly.\\n\\n“We want to make sure the election is honest, and I’m not sure that it can be,” Trump told reporters. “I don’t know that it can be with this whole situation, unsolicited ballots.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-latinos-veterans-florida/2020/09/15/6e466eea-f78b-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html', 'Full Text': '“Donald Trump has done nothing but assault the dignity of Hispanic families over and over and over and over again,” Biden said in comments marking the start of National Hispanic Heritage Month. “It’s wrong.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe cast himself as an alternative who would stand up for Latinos and help improve their lives, and he nodded to their crucial role in the upcoming election. “More than any other time, the Hispanic community and the Latino community hold in the palm of their hand the destiny of this country,” Biden said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe remarks were part of an urgent push to shore up his support among Latino voters.

That case, he added, includes “education, health care, immigration, the whole notion of dealing with covid in a way that doesn’t so damage the Hispanic community, which is hurt very badly, much worse than the Caucasian community.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe suggested that Trump is doing little to help pass legislation that could benefit Latino and other voters. “He should get off the damn golf course and sit down in the Oval Office and sit with both Republicans and Democrats and get something done,” Biden said.\\n\\nTrump and his supporters argue that his presidency has been highly beneficial for Latinos, especially when in job creation, an assertion that sidesteps the pandemic’s significant economic impact on minority communities.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Trump’s allies sought to make the case that Democrats pose as friends of Latinos but do little to help then. Former Puerto Rico attorney general Jose Fuentes accused Biden of viewing the Latino community as a “political prop.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRegarding polls suggesting that Biden has ground to make up in the Latino community, activists and leaders cite several reasons. They note a lingering displeasure with Barack Obama’s deportation policies, a lack of detail in Biden’s own immigration plans, an inner circle that lacks a large number of Latinos, and a perception that Biden’s campaign has placed a priority on attracting White suburbanites and African Americans, rather than courting Latinos.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBiden’s campaign has defended his efforts, saying the former vice president is pursuing a diverse electoral coalition like the one that rallied behind Obama in 2008 and 2012. Biden’s running mate, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), has spoken or met several times with Latino groups.\\n\\nOn the bright side for Biden, he appears to be eating into Trump’s once dominant advantage among older voters, and on Tuesday he slammed Trump over his talk of a payroll tax cut, framing such a move as a danger to Social Security.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It’s just absolutely foolish. What we should be is increasing Social Security for people,” Biden said in an interview with WFLA TV in Tampa.\\n\\nIn a state with many retirees, Biden’s strength with the group has put him in a position to win, and polls suggest Florida is now a toss-up.

Too late, responded Woodward: The book was getting printed (its release date is Tuesday).\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Rage,” Woodward told Trump, reaches some conclusions on his presidency. “It’s a tough book. There are going to be things that you are not gonna like, judgments that I made,” said Woodward on “60 Minutes,” summing up his message to the president. The president responded, “It looks like I don’t have it on this book, but we’ll get you sometime later, I guess.”\\n\\nThen came this:\\n\\nIn an email, Woodward laid out the sequence: “He called me an hour and a half before that tweet, and I told him it was going to be a tough book and there would be judgments that he would not like. So he sent out that tweet an hour and a half after his call.” The tweets themselves reflect a bit of disinformation savvy, in that they cite the “Fake Dossier,” a reference to the Steele dossier on Russian election interference, a document that, indeed, has proved flimsy. As if the Steele dossier — the product of a former British spy funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign — has poisoned the entire U.S. publishing world!\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYet the noteworthy aspect of Trump’s claim is that it came a full month before the book’s publication date, and it was based on a candid effort by the author to prepare Trump for its contents. For years we’ve known that when Trump decries “fake news,” he means merely critical information. Now there’s hard and fast confirmation of this equation.\\n\\nThe slam against the as-yet-unpublished “Rage” also suggests that Trump had previously held out hope that the book would present a positive look at his presidency. As the New York Times points out, Trump regretted declining to participate in “Fear,” Woodward’s first, also critical, book on the Trump years. He thought he could move the needle with “Rage.”\\n\\nThat idea, in itself, is a revelation: How could master liar Trump believe that after 18 interviews and mismanagement at every level of government, he’d come off looking good in a Woodward book? There’s one likely answer: that he really does believe all that stuff he watches on Fox News every night.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/arizona-political-geography/', 'Full Text': 'Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events\\n\\nAnalysis close Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events\\n\\n(Lauren Tierney/The Washington Post) ([object Object])\\n\\nSeventh in a series on swing states\\n\\nHow did the home of Barry Goldwater become a swing state? If it flips from red to blue this year, the question — not hard to answer — might be why it didn’t flip sooner. One in 4 voters are non-White, an electorate that’s heavily Democratic here, and a slim majority of voters were college graduates, according to the 2016 exit polls.\\n\\nEvery other state with that profile, every other state with rapid urban growth, has been moving briskly toward Democrats since 2016. By nominating Arizona’s senior senator for president in 2008, and by picking the first-ever Mormon nominee in 2012, Republicans ran stronger here in other states with similar Latino populations and similar urban-rural splits.\\n\\n“The Arizona electorate is primed for the Democratic Party,” said Rep. Ruben Gallego, who has represented downtown Phoenix in Congress since 2015. “If the Democratic Party is doing well in highly educated, urbanized, suburbanized areas, we’re doing well in Arizona — it’s 80 percent urban and suburban, and the same time, we have a rising young Latino community that is voting Democratic. Just one of those would make the state competitive, but you add them together and we’re seeing a surge.”\\n\\nArizona’s shift from 2012 to 2016 Phoenix swung hard left, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the GOP advantage in the state.

The advent of air conditioning transformed Arizona from a collection of small cities and sprawling Native American reservation to a beacon for people — often retirees — fleeing the Midwest. One in 11 Arizonans are military veterans, and for a long time, the suburbs blossoming across Maricopa County gave the GOP an unbeatable advantage in presidential elections.\\n\\nAlways conservative, Arizona’s Republicans moved further to the right since 2008 — and it has cost them. The 2010 passage of S.B. 1070, one of the country’s strictest anti-immigration laws, won votes at first but galvanized the left and the Latino vote. The late senator John McCain faced conservative challengers in his final two campaigns; former senator Jeff Flake retired rather than face likely defeat over his criticism of President Trump.\\n\\nBut the conservatives were losing, too, with Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio ousted by voters in 2016 and Republicans ceding a Senate seat and the secretary of state’s office in 2018. The state’s GOP chair, Kelli Ward, made her name as a fringe Senate candidate (“Chemtrail Kelli”). And the state’s Republican legislative majority is seen as vulnerable, both because of the parties’ shifts and because of voter unhappiness with how Gov. Doug Ducey (R) responded to the coronavirus.\\n\\nWant more like this? It’s in The Trailer. David Weigel delivers campaign news and insight into your inbox.

Immigration, which has often reshaped politics in the state, has been subsumed by other issues this year, and one Democratic bet is that Trump, who pardoned Arpaio in 2017, has taken the wrong side of the state’s culture wars.\\n\\nDemocrats also look fondly at Arizona for a very 2020 reason: Like Florida, it has a robust early-voting tradition and allows votes to be counted before Election Day. Though it’s one of the last states to close polls Nov. 3, Arizona, like Florida, could offer the first clues to how the election is going, as election officials count early votes before Election Day begins. And it could tell us whether vote patterns are looking more like 2016, when Republicans held enough suburban voters to win, or 2018, when they didn’t.\\n\\nTo understand Arizona, we’ve split it into four political “states.” The biggest by far is Phoenix, or Maricopa County, which casts so much of the state’s vote that a win there usually ends the race. The Tucson area is and has been a stronghold for Democrats, even when they lose statewide. The Red West is the most Republican part of the state; the Red East has big pockets of Democrats, but it has more of the conservative voters the president needs to win.\\n\\nThis is the seventh in a series breaking down the key swing states of 2020, showing how electoral trends played out over the past few years and where the shift in votes really mattered.

(Lauren Tierney/The Washington Post) ([object Object]) The modern Republican Party’s strength in Arizona came from Maricopa County. In the past 25 years, its population doubled, and from the start of the century until 2016, no Republican nominee for president won it by fewer than 10 points. In 1948, the last time a Democratic nominee carried the county, the city of Scottsdale didn’t even exist. But even then, Maricopa dominated state politics. It cast 45 percent of Arizona’s votes in 1948; by 2016, it was casting 53 percent. Nine of Arizona’s biggest cities are here, from deep blue Phoenix and Tempe to deep red Peoria and Surprise. Demographics explain much of the political difference, with White voters making up about three-quarters of the electorate in the reddest cities and less than half of it in Phoenix. By advancing in these suburbs, Democrats have put the whole state in play; in 2018, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema won practically everything here inside the 101 and 202 highway loops. Even Mesa, founded by Mormons and still shaped by their politics, swung to the left. The result, in 2016, was a collapse in the Republican margin. Mitt Romney came out of Maricopa with a 146,597-vote lead, while Trump won it by 45,467. Polling has found Trump trailing Joe Biden in the county, and losing it by any margin would make it hard for the ticket to win statewide. 2016 vote total Donald Trump 747,857 Hillary Clinton 702,390 2016 vote totals Donald Trump: 747,857\\n\\nHillary Clinton: 702,390 Counties included: Maricopa\\n\\nTucson Compared with the state overall, the voting population here … Has an average share of people living in cities .\\n\\nof people living in cities .

(Lauren Tierney/The Washington Post) ([object Object]) Democrats dominate southeastern Arizona, and in 2016, they carried all but three precincts along the U.S.-Mexico border. Their strength here comes from three blue centers: the cities of Tucson and Nogales, and the Tohono O’odham Nation, 4,500 square miles in the middle of Pima County. In 2020, growth and Democratic turnout in Tucson was enough to flip the 2nd Congressional District, which Sen. Martha McSally (R) won twice as a member of Congress — and which former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, the wife of this year’s Democratic Senate nominee, won before her. Tucson, where the University of Arizona has helped grow a year-round liberal political culture, has given Democrats bigger margins every four years. That’s given the party more of a cushion as it competes in the rest of the state. In 2016, Donald Trump got 555 fewer votes in the region than George W. Bush did in his reelection campaign; Hillary Clinton ran 36,314 votes ahead of John F. Kerry. 2016 vote total Donald Trump 171,286 Hillary Clinton 236,418 2016 vote totals Donald Trump: 171,286\\n\\nHillary Clinton: 236,418 Counties included: Pima, Santa Cruz\\n\\nRed East Compared with the state overall, the voting population here … Has a lower share of people living in cities than average .\\n\\nof people living in cities than average .

(Lauren Tierney/The Washington Post) ([object Object]) Before Tucson and Phoenix became party strongholds, Democrats’ strongest vote in Arizona came in the Native American reservations here. The Apache and Navajo nations cover nearly half of the region and contain more than 200,000 Arizonans. Democrats have also added votes in the city of Flagstaff, the biggest population center that isn’t an exurb of Phoenix, where Mormon voters have struggled with aspects of Trump’s personality and presidency. Still, those exurbs give the region a red hue — Pinal County, which contains those conservative towns down Interstate 10, is the most populous part of Arizona that actually moved toward Trump in 2016. He won more votes in that region than Democrats won in Flagstaff, growing the GOP margin in eastern Arizona from 25,236 votes in 2012 to 32,251 votes in 2016. For every vote Trump picked up here, Democrats picked up seven in Maricopa, and further movement in that direction would let Trump win most of the region while clearly losing the state. 2016 vote total Donald Trump 174,944 Hillary Clinton 142,722 2016 vote totals Donald Trump: 174,944\\n\\nHillary Clinton: 142,722 Counties included: Apache, Cochise, Coconino, Gila, Graham, Greenlee, Navajo, Pinal'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/30/donald-trump-doesnt-really-care-about-white-supremacy-youre-not-going-make-him/', 'Full Text': 'During the first presidential debate Tuesday, Trump tried to do both.\\n\\n“You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out antifa and other left-wing extremist groups,” moderator Chris Wallace said, “but are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia groups, and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities, as we saw in Kenosha and as we’ve seen in Portland?”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Sure,” Trump replied a few times — although he notably didn’t offer any words of condemnation, despite Wallace and his opponent, former vice president Joe Biden, encouraging him to do so.\\n\\n“I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing, not from the right wing,” the president added. “I’m willing to do anything. I want to see peace.\"\\n\\n“Well, then, do it, sir,” Wallace pressed.\\n\\nTrump asked for the name of a group to condemn, with Biden offering the name of the reactionary fascist group Proud Boys.\\n\\n“Proud Boys, stand back and stand by,” Trump said. Then he quickly moved on: “But I’ll tell you what — I’ll tell you what, somebody’s got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem.”\\n\\nIn fact, it is a right-wing problem. Last week, acting Homeland Security director Chad Wolf said at a Senate hearing that white supremacists pose “the most persistent and lethal threat when we talk about domestic violent extremists.” Draft reports from Wolf’s agency outlining significant terrorism threats indicate that white supremacists pose the greatest risk to the public, more so than international actors.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Trump much prefers to suggest either equivalence between left-wing and right-wing groups or to imply that the actions of antifascists — antifa — are more dangerous. The president has often attributed recent incidents of violence to antifa, without justification. His team understands where he wants to focus, with the attorney general and, according to a whistleblower, DHS officials seeking to play down the threat that white supremacists pose in favor of the purported threat from antifa. And Trump on Tuesday made clear that this is the balance he favors.\\n\\nAgain, it’s not that he won’t denounce white supremacy in broad strokes if pressed. It’s that he understands that white supremacists generally support him and his administration, and that he’s therefore loath to criticize them. (See also: QAnon.) And it’s moreover that Trump simply doesn’t really consider white supremacy a problem to be addressed, beyond in the most obvious, Jim Crow-era sorts of manifestations of hooded Klansmen burning crosses. Trump doesn’t see significant structural racism in the United States — as he repeatedly has said publicly and as he told The Washington Post’s Bob Woodward in June — and, relatedly, won’t spontaneously criticize overt racists.\\n\\nThere have been times that Trump has offered criticism of white supremacists. It generally comes, though, in prepared remarks that he’s reading in response to some acute racial conflict.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfter the death of a racism protester in Charlottesville in 2017, Trump read a statement declaring that “we must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans.”\\n\\n“Racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs,” he continued, “including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacist and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear.”\\n\\nThe next day, though, when asked about the events, he responded without a script — suggesting that his comments the prior day should be sufficient.\\n\\n“I\\'ve condemned neo-Nazis,” he said with obvious anger. “I\\'ve condemned many different groups, but not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists by any stretch.\"\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt a rally a few days after that, Trump was obviously incensed that the media was focused not on his scripted comments but, instead, on his obvious sympathy for pro-Confederacy protesters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTo a cheering crowd, he read parts of his statement.\\n\\n“ ‘We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans,’ right?” Trump read. “Then I said, ‘racism is evil.’ Do they report that I said that racism is evil? You know why? Because they are very dishonest people.”\\n\\nHe went on a riff about CNN having a bunch of critics on a panel and how the network fired his supporter Jeffrey Lord. He did not mention that Lord was fired for invoking a Nazi slogan on social media.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“ ‘And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold true as Americans,’ ” he continued. “Now let me ask you, can it be any better than that, in all fairness?”\\n\\nWhen a gunman in El Paso killed nearly two dozen people at a Walmart, Trump was again called upon to denounce racist rhetoric. The alleged shooter had published a screed online that specifically echoed Trump’s arguments about immigration.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy,” Trump said in prepared remarks. “These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSpeaking to reporters before traveling to the city, though, he expressed agreement with the alleged shooter’s view of the need to restrict immigration. He was also asked whether he was concerned about an apparent increase in violence linked to white supremacists.\\n\\n“I am concerned about the rise of any group of hate,” he said. “I don’t like it, any group of hate, whether it’s white supremacy, whether it’s any other kind of supremacy, whether it’s antifa, whether it’s any group of hate, I am very concerned about it, and I’ll do something about it.”\\n\\nThat equivalence between left and right appears over and over. Even when Trump decided to denounce racism on Twitter on the anniversary of the violence in Charlottesville, he denounced “all types of racism” — tacitly equating anti-Black racism with perceived racism targeting Whites. This is a common view among his supporters, in fact, that White Americans are also or more likely to be targets of racism and discrimination.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA poll conducted after Charlottesville found that 3 in 10 of Trump’s strongest backers supported or shrugged at the idea of white supremacy.\\n\\nTrump’s obvious annoyance at having to denounce a group that supports his presidency and that he doesn’t consider something to be concerned about is not new. In February 2016, as he was fighting to win the Republican presidential nomination, he was asked why he had retweeted white supremacists. He declined to admit any mistake.\\n\\n“I don\\'t know about retweeting. I mean, you retweet somebody, and turns out to be a white supremacist,” he said. “I know nothing about these groups that are supporting me.\"\\n\\nA few days later, he received the public support of David Duke, perhaps the country\\'s most infamous white nationalist and someone who, in 2000, Trump had publicly condemned in an essay written for the New York Times.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut in 2016, Trump was more reluctant to condemn the former Ku Klux Klan leader.\\n\\n“Well, just so you understand, I don’t know anything about David Duke, okay?” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don’t know. I don’t know, did he endorse me or what’s going on, because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists.”\\n\\nThe annoyance is tangible. Trump wants the nation to worry about violence in the streets but violence from leftists, not his supporters. (After a 17-year-old allegedly shot and killed two Black Lives Matter protesters in Wisconsin, Trump described the incident as an act of self-defense.) He doesn’t want to be viewed as racist and will denounce the KKK in the abstract. But fundamentally, he doesn’t consider the white supremacist ideology a real concern.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfter a man killed 49 Muslims at a mosque in New Zealand in early 2019, Trump was asked whether white nationalism posed a threat globally.\\n\\n“I don’t, really,” he replied. “I think it’s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.”\\n\\nShortly after that incident, the Pew Research Center released polling finding that most Americans, including a quarter of Republicans, thought Trump had done too little to distance himself from white nationalists. Similar numbers thought that, in fact, he had encouraged the ideology. After Tuesday night, white nationalists themselves indicated that they considered his debate response encouraging.\\n\\nSen. Tim Scott (S.C.), the only Black Republican in Congress, told reporters Wednesday that, with his failure to denounce white supremacists, Trump “misspoke.” The president, he said, “should correct it.”\\n\\n“If he doesn\\'t correct it,” Scott continued, “I guess he didn\\'t misspeak.\"\\n\\nIn an interview with Fox News Channel, White House communications director Alyssa Farah said that Trump would in fact not refine his debate response.\\n\\n“I don’t think that there’s anything to clarify,” Farah said — revealing a truth, however unintentionally.\\n\\nLater, however, Trump did finally offer the direct rejection that he failed to provide Tuesday. In a way.\\n\\n“White supremacists: they clearly love you and support you,” a reporter said.\\n\\nTrump nodded.\\n\\n“Do you welcome that?” the reporter asked.\\n\\nTrump riffed on police for a bit.\\n\\n“Do you denounce them?” the reporter asked.\\n\\n“I’ve always denounced any form — any form, any form of any of that,” Trump replied, “you have to denounce.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/17/why-i-dropped-conservative-my-twitter-profile/', 'Full Text': 'If you say you are a staunch defender of the rule of law, that you are devoted to ending systematic racism, that you are an advocate of legal immigration, that you believe in objective reality (including climate change science) and that you think illiberal regimes such as Russia are our greatest foreign threat, the party of Trump will lash out at you. They will accuse you of Trump derangement syndrome and dub you a “fake” conservative. Well, they have a point. Because conservatives no longer seem to champion any of those positions (or free trade or American international leadership or NATO), it is hard to say I fit in any longer.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWriting for the Bulwark, Shay Khatiri details the collapse of the alliance among economic, national security and social conservatives, concluding:\\n\\nSo yes, conservatism is dead. The Tea Party in 2010s tried to resurrect it. But all that the angry and bitter zombie Reaganites of the Tea Party ultimately accomplished was making conservatism look obstructionist — and, with the ascension of Donald Trump, they have turned into zombie Buchananites. To the extent that the mindless mush that is called “conservatism” today is in obedient lockstep with Donald Trump, it is nationalist, hateful, intolerant, and unpatriotic.\\n\\nIf adherents cannot defend their position without resorting to conspiracy theories, factual misrepresentation and racism, perhaps what they are adhering to is fundamentally flawed. The need to invent a scary, socialist-possessed Joe Biden to justify reelecting President Trump (as my colleagues have delightfully parodied) strongly suggests there is no morally defensible reason for reelecting a man who thinks our covid-19 deaths wouldn’t look so bad if we just ignored blue states. (First, that’s monstrous, and second, the states with spiking infection and death rates are red states.)\\n\\nThere is a healthy debate about whether Republicans were always racist frauds. My friend Stuart Stevens has a strong case to make that they were. Others claim Trump took that marginal element in the GOP and made it dominant. While I continue to believe that decent, honorable conservatives such as George H.W. Bush, John McCain and, yes, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) were or are sincere patriots, I am forced to concede the racist, xenophobic and anti-intellectual element in the party was far more pronounced than I was willing to admit.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSo if “conservative” has no meaning and if many of the 1980 positions (e.g., infinitely reducing taxes for the wealthy, hostility to the New Deal) are entirely unsuited to our current challenges, what ideology properly fits ex-Republicans unwilling to swallow the lies or descend into intellectual dishonesty?\\n\\nThe same set of beliefs that always animated me — America’s international leadership, defense of human rights, constitutional governance, equal justice under the law, a vibrant but not unfettered free market, limited but energetic government and public virtue — could be considered “19th century liberalism” (quite a mouthful) or moderation (which I have frequently explained does not mean the squishy middle). The name is far less important than the outlook and the rejection of extremism, racism, authoritarianism, isolationism, xenophobia, cruelty, deceit and tribalism.\\n\\nThere are very, very few self-identified Republicans on the national stage who meet that criteria (okay, maybe just Romney) and only a handful at the state or local level (e.g., Govs. Larry Hogan of Maryland and Charlie Baker of Massachusetts). Most are out of government (e.g., former governors John Kasich of Ohio, William F. Weld of Massachusetts and Jeb Bush of Florida).\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere are many (but not all) Democrats, including former vice president Joe Biden, I believe, who represent that world view. We will see how he does if elected. For now, the objective remains removal of Trump and obliteration of a party that has grievously betrayed democracy and abandoned simple decency and honesty. Whatever alternative to the toxic waste dump of the Trump GOP arises to replace it may be worth considering — but only if it embodies the most basic American creed (“We the people. . .”) and abandons veneration of authoritarianism.\\n\\nWatch Opinions videos:'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/07/russian-trolls-graphika-parler-gab/', 'Full Text': 'What makes Leo’s assertions noteworthy, however, is that last week his account was identified as a key asset in an alleged Russian disinformation campaign that has been purged from three mainstream social media platforms. But two others, Parler and the far-right Gab, continue to host accounts that reportedly are part of the operation, which the independent research group Graphika said “resembled” a previous campaign linked to Russia’s notorious Internet Research Agency, whose social media campaign marred the 2016 presidential election.\\n\\nParler and Gab offered different reasons for their inaction: Parler said it had not heard directly from U.S. law enforcement on the issue and, hence, did not need to act. Gab founder Andrew Torba said of the alleged Russian accounts, “They can speak freely on Gab just like anyone else.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe impact of their decisions is that an alleged Russian disinformation campaign — whose discovery was triggered by an FBI tip and first publicized by a Reuters news report last week — continues to operate with apparent impunity on the platforms where it was most active in targeting American voters.\\n\\nAmong the goals, Graphika found, was to promote Trump’s reelection and denigrate Biden, much as Russians did to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016.\\n\\nGraphika, a New York-based firm that works closely with mainstream platforms such as Facebook, said it was the first known Russian operation on Parler and Gab.

If Graphika feels this is a legitimate threat, we welcome them to file a report per our terms of service.”\\n\\nTorba declined to comment on whether Gab, which has 1.4 million users, had any communication with law enforcement over the alleged Russian accounts.

Sure, a White House spokesman told Politico that the plan “has nothing to do with politics.” It’s just that the team is trying to figure out how to make it happen before Nov. 3, a date with no special significance whatsoever.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen this was first proposed, the New York Times reported that pharmaceutical companies balked at the idea of distributing what they referred to pejoratively as “Trump cards”: cash handouts tied explicitly to the president. But Trump’s team made very clear that the cards would not bear Trump’s name, perish the thought.\\n\\nAccording to Politico’s new reporting, the cards will instead be accompanied by a letter signed by Trump. No politicking here, no sir. It’s not as though Trump is trailing among voters over 65, a group he won in 2016. Were that the case, one would think that he’d release some sort of video explicitly focused on seniors, maybe calling them his favorite people in the world. Maybe putting “favorite” in all-caps, to really emphasize it.\\n\\nOh.\\n\\nThe issue here isn’t only that Trump’s clearly trying to leverage the government in ways that will benefit him personally, the sort of thing that might get a fella impeached. What’s more remarkable is how expensive it is — how expensive his cumulative efforts to leverage the presidency to aid his campaign will turn out to be.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHere is a brief shopping receipt.\\n\\n$19 million. Those letters which the administration hopes to send out with the drug-benefit cards aren’t free. Documents obtained by Politico estimate that sending them out to the country’s 39 million Medicare beneficiaries will cost $19 million, or about 48 cents apiece.\\n\\n$7.8 billion. Then there’s the value of the cards themselves. If each of those 39 million people gets $200, as planned, the costs add up quickly: nearly $8 billion in costs to the government. The money would be paid out of Medicare’s trust fund.\\n\\n$72.4 million. There are other costs, too, like buying and activating the cards and providing phone-based support for their use. The proposal obtained by Politico puts the price tag for these additional items at over $72 million, most of it in fiscal 2021, which began Oct. 1.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat’s about $7.9 billion — just for the drug-benefit card program. But that is by no means the only way in which Trump is leveraging government money in an obvious attempt to influence the election.\\n\\n$11.6 billion. After spending years downplaying the damage done to Puerto Rico after it was hit by Hurricane Maria in 2017, Trump announced last month that he was providing the island with $9.6 billion to repair its electrical grid and $2 billion more to rebuild schools and other facilities. Again, this is more than three years after the hurricane hit and after he repeatedly complained about how much aid the island had received. But there are a lot of Puerto Rican voters in Florida, a state Trump almost certainly needs to win if he hopes to be reelected.\\n\\nMore than $1 million. In the wake of the economy’s crumpling at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, the Department of Agriculture distributed 75 million boxes of food to families to ensure food security. Some percentage of those boxes included letters signed by Trump, though it’s unclear how many and how much the letters cost. Assume that a third of the boxes included letters which cost 5 cents to print (almost certainly a lowball figure) and the total tops $1.2 million.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAround $43 million. In addition to ensuring that Trump’s name appeared on stimulus checks the government disbursed at the outset of the pandemic, the government went out of its way to ensure that those receiving the stimulus electronically also knew whom to thank. An estimated 90 million such letters were sent. If we assume the costs were the same as the drug-benefit card letters, that’s about $43 million in costs.\\n\\n$0 to $400 billion. Another Trump proposal aimed at dampening the effects of the pandemic was to suspend payroll taxes until the end of the year (read: after November), thereby putting more money in people’s pockets. Such a plan would have cost the government an estimated $400 billion. But Trump’s proposal also had those taxes being repaid next year, meaning that, on net, there wouldn’t be a cost to the government.\\n\\nTrump had a solution for that.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“If I’m victorious on Nov. 3, I plan to forgive these taxes and make permanent cuts to the payroll tax,” he said in September. So vote for Trump — or you have to repay all the taxes that were withheld.\\n\\nFor obvious reasons, many employers declined to participate in the proposal.\\n\\n$23.2 billion. After Trump announced new tariffs on products manufactured in China, China retaliated by imposing tariffs on American goods, including agricultural products. That was a blow to farmers, so Trump took money from his tariffs — money mostly paid by American consumers — and distributed it back to farmers through the Market Facilitation Program. From 2018 to 2020, that program provided $23.2 billion to farmers. An analysis of those payments conducted by The Post in 2019 found that 9 in 10 counties which voted for Trump received some benefit from the program, with counties that flipped from blue to red in 2016 being slightly more likely to benefit.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPriceless. Since he took office, Trump and his team have largely ignored a law prohibiting the use of public resources for campaigning. That includes things like advocating political positions while acting in an official capacity, or, say, having your staff do prep work so you can accept your party’s nomination while standing on the South Lawn of the White House.\\n\\nEven beyond that law, though, Trump has eagerly used his position for political purposes. Not only the convention speech, but the elements of his convention program that showed him pardoning a former prisoner or naturalizing new citizens. He rarely respects any boundary between his official duties and his campaign, blending formal White House events with his electoral patter. There’s value in his ability to use his office to boost his campaign, but one can’t put a price tag on the more abstract instances of his doing so.\\n\\nThere are other examples of the government suddenly taking an interest in making unusual points in politically useful places. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, for example, announced last week that it was buying six billboards in Pennsylvania, blaming sanctuary policies in the state for allowing wanted criminals to go free. Just a random decision to advertise a central component of Trump’s campaign platform in a state he barely won four years ago, nothing more to read into that, I’m sure.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-debate-liberals/2020/09/30/88c54b90-033b-11eb-a2db-417cddf4816a_story.html', 'Full Text': 'During his first debate against President Trump, and again the next day, the Democratic nominee distanced himself from his party’s left wing in some of his starkest terms yet, pushing back against Trump’s efforts to brand him a puppet of “radical socialists.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“What the president keeps trying to do, he’s trying to run against somebody other than me,” Biden said Wednesday on a whistle-stop tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania. “I’ve said to the left, the right and the center exactly where I am on each of these issues.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBiden’s debate comments, which reflected his commitment to winning over moderates in battleground states, prompted some concern among left-leaning activists, including at least one whose group reached out to his campaign to express his worries. But they were also followed by an embrace from some of the very liberal leaders Biden is keeping at arm’s length — including Ocasio-Cortez, one of the chief sponsors of the Green New Deal.\\n\\n“Our differences are exactly why I joined Biden’s climate unity task force — so we could set aside our differences & figure out an aggressive climate plan to address the planetary crisis at our feet,” she tweeted late Tuesday, referring to one of the working groups Biden set up with liberals after capturing the nomination. Biden said Wednesday that he while they had not spoken recently, “I appreciated her endorsement.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHer Green New Deal co-sponsor, Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), sounded similar notes. “I support the Green New Deal and I’m voting for Vice President Joe Biden,” Markey said in a statement. “Donald Trump is wrong. The progressive left is with Joe Biden, and we will pass a Green New Deal.”\\n\\nThe collective reaction on the left underlined the difficult balancing act facing the liberal movement since Biden won the nomination. Liberal activists are determined to push him on health care, climate change and economic policy, but they fear that too much resistance could hurt what they see as the overriding priority: defeating Trump. Many do not want to be blamed for derailing his campaign, as they were in 2016 for spurring significant defections from Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Unfortunately, that’s the position we’re in right now,” said Heather Stockwell, who served as a Sanders delegate to the Democratic National Convention and plans to vote for Biden. “We’re going at this from a medical perspective: We have to stop the bleeding and hemorrhaging right now.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump renewed his efforts to stir divisions Wednesday, tweeting that in the debate, Biden “disrespected Bernie, effectively calling him a loser!” But liberals said that when Trump tries to stoke disagreement in their ranks, it hardens their desire to unite toward the goal of voting him out of office.\\n\\n“I think no one takes Donald Trump seriously,” said Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), who supported Sanders and now backs Biden. “He’s somewhere between showman and clown, depending on the day.”\\n\\nBiden’s posture at the debate reflected his belief that the path to the White House runs largely though moderate suburbs where voters are sick of Trump but are not ready to embrace ideas such as government-run health care or defunding the police.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut that strategy is not without risk, and some on the left fear that turnout could be depressed among liberal voters. Sanders himself has expressed concerns about Biden’s strategy.\\n\\nAt the same time, the senator from Vermont is campaigning virtually for Biden and said Wednesday that he soon plans to hit the road for Biden. “I’m doing everything I can,” Sanders said on ABC’s “The View.” Sanders also defended Biden against Trump’s attacks, reiterating that Biden does not agree with him on health care. “I wish he did, but he does not,” he said.\\n\\nTrump and his allies have relentlessly sought to cast Biden as beholden to Sanders’s brand of democratic socialism, despite Biden actively rejecting that philosophy in the primary and doing so again in the debate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders’s far left on the manifesto, we call it,” Trump said in one heated exchange.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Manifesto?” asked an incredulous Biden.\\n\\n“And that gives you socialized medicine,” interjected Trump.\\n\\n“Look, hey, I’m not going to listen to him. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders,” Biden shot back.\\n\\n“Not by much,” Trump retorted.\\n\\n“I beat him by a whole hell of a lot. I’m here standing facing you, old buddy,” snapped Biden.\\n\\nBiden underscored his commitment to expand the Affordable Care Act with an optional public insurance program, rather than replacing it with Medicare-for-all as Sanders and others want.\\n\\nBiden repeatedly made the point that he won the nomination by defeating more leftist candidates. “My party is me,” Biden said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHealth care is hardly the only major issue that has divided Democrats. While Democrats generally agree about the dire threats presented by climate change, for example, they hold different views of how aggressively to tackle it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEvan Weber, political director of the Sunrise Movement, a group of youthful climate activists, called it a victory that the Green New Deal got any debate time at all. Still, he said his group reached out to Biden’s campaign about the nominee’s pointed distancing of himself from the plan, arguing that it could cost him votes. The Biden campaign listened to the concerns, he said, and Biden eased their worries when he told reporters that while he has his own plan, the Green New Deal was not bad.\\n\\n“The vice president has an enthusiasm and mobilization gap with young people, particularly young people of color,” Weber said. “This was an opportunity to reach out to them and get them excited about his campaign. And I’m not sure that his performance on this question did that. So we’re hopeful that the campaign sees that as a mistake and misstep.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEarlier this year, there was hope for more cooperation. After Sanders dropped out, he quickly backed Biden and their teams formed unity task forces that issued recommendations on climate change, immigration and health care. Biden also moved closer to Sanders on combating student debt.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut since then there has been less harmony. “I beat the socialist. That’s how I got elected,” Biden said in an interview with Fox 11 News in Wisconsin last week.\\n\\nBut liberal fears about a second Trump term have prevented the fractures of 2016. Actress Susan Sarandon, a Sanders surrogate who supported the Green Party ticket in 2016, has endorsed Biden as “a vote against fascism.” Most left-wing groups that backed Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in the primary have either endorsed Biden or shifted their focus to down-ballot races, not to protests of the nominee.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe dampened enthusiasm for a “Dem Exit,” as the Green Party supporters called for in 2016, was on display at a leftist-oriented demonstration near the debate site Tuesday.\\n\\nAttacks on Trump — including a chant that combined his name with a four-letter word — got far more applause than attacks on the two-party system. Even as Green Party presidential nominee Howie Hawkins roamed near the back of the crowd, some in the crowd wore Biden-Harris masks.\\n\\n“We may not have the best candidate right now, but God knows, we have the lesser evil,” said Asia Jones, the rally’s emcee. “I need us to vote. I need Trump and [Vice President] Pence to be out of the White House.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/29/trump-biden-falsehoods-tale-tape/', 'Full Text': 'But not all falsehoods are equal, and there are significant differences between the two men in how they mangle the facts. Here’s the tale of the tape in how Trump and Biden measure up before their first presidential debate.\\n\\nBiden\\n\\nBiden, with nearly a half century in politics, is an old-fashioned politician. He is prone to exaggeration and not often precise about policy issues, in contrast to more disciplined politicians like former president Barack Obama or former Florida governor Jeb Bush. Biden especially gets in trouble because of his loquacious nature, though he has tried to rein in his stemwinders during this presidential run. He often indicates he is knowledgeable about complex policy issues.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMany of Biden’s factual errors are dismissed as “gaffes,” innocent mess-ups. In a recent interview with CNN, Jill Biden, his wife, sought to dismiss the issue: “After Donald Trump, you cannot even say the word gaffe.”\\n\\nBut it’s more than just gaffes. Here are some prime examples of Biden falsehoods.\\n\\nDubious numbers\\n\\nBiden does not always get the numbers right.\\n\\nIn one famous example as vice president, Biden in 2011 touted an Obama-era jobs bill by claiming the number of rapes in Flint, Mich., had, depending on the hour, doubled, tripled and even quadrupled because the number of police had been reduced. There was no evidence to support any of these statistics, earning him Four Pinocchios and an editorial in the Delaware County Daily Times titled “Biden plays fast and loose with the facts.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMore recently, while running for president, Biden has falsely claimed that if Trump had handled the coronavirus pandemic properly, everyone who had died in the United States would be alive (there is no data to support this), that the trade deficit with China has never been higher (it has dropped in the last two years) and that Trump has never condemned white supremacists (Trump has, even as he mitigated it with his “both sides” comment). Biden also routinely inflates numbers, such as saying Trump admitted to Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward that covid-19 was seven times more contagious than the flu, when in fact Trump had said five times.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGarbled messaging\\n\\nBiden’s talking points sometimes get mangled together. After an attack on the Medicare-for-all plan promoted by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during the primaries, Biden’s staff admitted:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe meant to say the plan would double the federal budget, except for interest on the debt, not that it was twice the federal budget.\\n\\nHe meant to say a tax on employers was like a deductible from your paycheck, not a deductible for your income tax.\\n\\nHe meant to say the employer tax was 7.5 percent, not “5 percent and 4 percent.”\\n\\nDuring another debate, Biden falsely said more than 90 percent of the American people believe we have to get assault weapons off the street. Support for banning the sale of assault weapons usually ranges from 50 to 60 percent in recent surveys. Biden mixed up the statistics for polling on expanding background checks, which does get support in the 90 percent range.\\n\\nBiden even attacked Trump once for fingerprinting food stamp recipients — when he meant to refer to former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg.\\n\\nRevisionist history\\n\\nFew politicians like to admit error. Biden handles it by offering a revisionist history that obscures his original policy position.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn trying to explain his vote in favor of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Biden has claimed that President George W. Bush misled him — which a Bush spokesman denies — and that he opposed the war from “the moment it started.” Actually, for more than a year, Biden repeatedly defended his vote to authorize an invasion as “just” and “right.” After The Fact Checker pointed that out, Biden said he “misspoke.”\\n\\nSimilarly, Biden’s explanation of his advice to Obama on whether to authorize the mission to kill Osama bin Laden has evolved over time. He initially said he urged Obama to not go and take more time to gather intelligence, but now he says he privately urged Obama to go. But that has not been confirmed by Obama.\\n\\nBiden’s involvement in the civil rights movement, in his retelling, also has grown more expansive over time. Campaigning this year, Biden suggested he walked out of restaurants and picketed movie theaters. As far as we could determine, Biden participated in just one walkout at one restaurant. He also picketed a segregated movie theater.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSince the emergence of the novel coronavirus, Biden has often oversold what he wrote in a late January opinion article for USA Today, claiming he said it was a pandemic. The USA Today piece is more of an attack on Trump and a recollection of Obama administration steps taken against the 2014 Ebola outbreak than a detailed plan for action against a possible pandemic. But at the same time, Biden indicated he took the threat seriously, even if he did not explicitly say a pandemic was on the way.\\n\\nInvented tales\\n\\nBiden sometimes tells stories that appear to have little basis in reality.\\n\\nEarlier this year, Biden told voters at least three times that he was arrested in South Africa while trying to visit Nelson Mandela in Soweto. Mandela, later president of South Africa, was imprisoned on Robben Island at the time, making the whole story an impossibility. Eventually, the campaign said Biden was separated from the Congressional Black Caucus members he was traveling with at an airport, but that did not make much sense, either. (Another White member of Congress said it did not happen.)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLast year, Biden told a moving tale of visiting Afghanistan and pinning a medal on a regretful soldier that jumbled elements of at least three actual events into one story. “In the space of three minutes, Biden got the time period, the location, the heroic act, the type of medal, the military branch and the rank of the recipient wrong, as well as his own role in the ceremony,” The Washington Post reported.\\n\\nNasty personal attacks\\n\\nBiden will fault what he views as policy mistakes, but generally he does not make nasty personal attacks based on falsehoods.\\n\\nTrump\\n\\nThe president comes from real estate background where what he once called “truthful hyperbole” is regarded as the norm. While in office, he has told dozens of falsehoods and misleading statements almost every day — in news conferences, prepared speeches, interviews and remarks to the media.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBiden makes mistakes and tells tall tales, but he often drops them or withdraws them if his error is highlighted in the media. Trump, by contrast, doubles down and repeats the false claim over and over. Indeed, when challenged with irrefutable evidence that his statement is wrong, Trump will grasp at the flimsiest pieces of evidence to insist he is right, even if the evidence contradicts or undermines what he had originally claimed.\\n\\nWe can only scratch the surface of Trump’s propensity for falsehoods in this article — The Fact Checker published a best-selling book on them — but here are some highlights. One of Trump’s biggest problems is that his knowledge of policy details is thin, so he often falls back on the same old spin when the questions try to probe deeper.\\n\\nDubious numbers\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump exaggerates about just about everything.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe falsely claims (hundreds of times) that before the pandemic, he built the greatest economy in U.S. history; even at its best under Trump, it was not as good as the U.S. economy in the 1950s, 1960s or 1980s, and it was already beginning to stumble when the pandemic arrived. He says he passed the biggest tax cut in U.S. history, but it ranks eighth. He says he scored massive job-creating deals with Saudi Arabia, but the numbers are wildly inflated (and the jobs are mostly in Saudi Arabia).\\n\\nTrump routinely cites statistics on immigration enforcement but flips the script depending whether border apprehensions are going up (“so many people arrested”) or going down (“so few people are crossing”).\\n\\nTrump has played similar games with economic statistics. In Trump’s version of history, he “inherited a mess” with “millions of people out there” seeking jobs, whereupon he “accomplished an economic turnaround of historical proportions.” But it was Obama who inherited an economic crisis, with the country shedding 800,000 jobs a month when he took office in 2009. Eight years later, Trump took over when the economy was adding about 200,000 jobs a month — as it continued to do through his first three years.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEven after nearly four years as president, Trump appears to have little idea of how NATO is funded and operates. He repeatedly claimed other members of the alliance “owed” money to the United States and they were delinquent in their payments. Then he claimed credit for the money “pouring in” as a result of his jawboning, even though much of the increase in those countries’ spending on their own defense had been set under guidelines arranged during the Obama administration. Trump has touted new NATO funding numbers that are fanciful — and has given himself all of the credit for the increase.\\n\\nGarbled messaging\\n\\nTrump remains relentlessly on message, repeating his false claims over and over, so he does not often mangle his talking points as much as Biden. But Trump does often speak in discursive, meandering monologues, making his meaning unclear. He is also often flippant. That sometimes gives him plausible deniability or allows him to claim that he was only joking.\\n\\nRevisionist history\\n\\nTrump never admits he made a mistake, and he often spins fairy tales that have little basis in reality.\\n\\nFor instance, he repeatedly claims he got his start in business with only a $1 million loan from his father, which he then turned into a $10 billion empire. Not only is his reported wealth dubious, but also, after examining more than 100,000 confidential documents, the New York Times concluded that Fred Trump’s “small loan” was $60.7 million, or $140 million in 2018 dollars, much of which was never repaid. In all, the Times found that Trump received the equivalent of at least $413 million in today’s dollars from his father’s real estate empire.\\n\\nTrump’s biggest domestic defeat of his presidency was his failed drive to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The effort that collapsed in the Senate would have weakened a key tenet of Obamacare: protections for people with preexisting health conditions. After that defeat, Trump’s rhetoric shifted: He falsely asserted more than 100 times that Republicans had protected people with preexisting conditions. In 2020, he even tweeted, “I was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your Healthcare.” He recently signed an executive order that he claimed would protect preexisting conditions. But he has never offered a plan that would do so and repeatedly claimed (falsely) he effectively eliminated Obamacare.\\n\\nSimilarly, one of Trump’s most famous campaign promises was that Mexico would pay for the border barrier he is building along the southern border. Not only did Trump redirect billions of dollars from military projects over the objections of Congress, but he keeps asserting that Mexico will pay for the wall in some mysterious fashion (such as through a trade deal or possibly adding toll booths at the border).\\n\\nIn battling the coronavirus pandemic, Trump has repeatedly tried to erase his original lackadaisical response with a story of how he took bold action against China with a travel ban opposed by all of his advisers. But Trump’s advisers pressed him to impose the ban, while he was initially skeptical, and the less-than-total ban came as many flights already were canceled and other countries were taking similar actions. Then Trump made the World Health Organization a scapegoat even though he had initially praised WHO’s efforts to stem the disease.\\n\\nInvented tales\\n\\nTrump frequently promotes conspiracy theories and asserts claims that have no basis in reality.\\n\\nSome of Trump’s stories are simply puzzling. Trump on four separate occasions has falsely asserted that Obama had such a bad relationship with the Philippines that the country’s leaders would not let him land his presidential jet during an official visit, leaving him circling above the airport. Obama actually made two visits where he was warmly received.\\n\\nTrump repeatedly said U.S. Steel was building six to eight new steel plants, but that wasn’t true. He said that as president, Obama gave citizenship to 2,500 Iranians during the nuclear-deal negotiations. It didn’t happen. Over and over, Trump claimed the Uzbekistan-born man who in 2017 was accused of killing eight people with a pickup truck in New York had brought two dozen relatives to the United States through chain migration. The actual number is zero.\\n\\nBut Trump’s tall tales also can be more nefarious. Trump has concocted conspiracy theories about Obama allegedly spying on his campaign, which he sometimes labels “Obamagate.” It started with Trump’s false claim in 2017 that Obama put a wiretap on him. Then that merged with a report that an FBI informant in Europe, a professor named Stefan Halper, met with at least three people working on the Trump campaign in Europe. A former campaign aide, Carter Page, was subject to an FBI warrant. Now Trump is focused on a January 2017 meeting Obama held in the Oval Office. Somehow, without much explanation, Trump has turned this meeting into a high crime that he considers to be treason.\\n\\nSimilarly, as the election has neared and Trump remains behind in the polls, the president has promoted bogus claims about the dangers of voting by mail. He also, without evidence, has claimed Biden must be on performance-enhancing drugs.\\n\\nNasty personal attacks\\n\\nIf Trump believes someone has crossed him, he will respond with a tsunami of untruths. His behavior is highly unusual for a politician, let alone a president. Without even a bit of humor, Trump lobs insults filled with falsehoods, changes history to denigrate opponents and fabricates tall tales about his foes out of whole cloth.\\n\\nThe examples are too numerous to mention and are probably familiar to readers. Trump falsely accused Rep. Ilhan Omar (D) of Minnesota of supporting the terrorist group behind the 9/11 attacks. He smeared Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) as “Danang Richard,” even though Blumenthal never described himself as a war hero in Vietnam or claimed to have fought in Danang. Trump invented a story about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) “dancing in the streets” of Chinatown as the coronavirus emerged, saying she was responsible for “many deaths.” (Not only did Pelosi take the coronavirus more seriously than Trump, but San Francisco has had relatively few deaths.)\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nBoth Biden and Trump have provided lots of fodder for fact-checkers. But Biden’s falsehoods tend to occur once — hence they are termed “gaffes” — or are withdrawn or dropped after criticism. Some of his errors are strange, but they generally do not have a nasty edge, and he does not engage in ad hominem attacks. Biden also exaggerates in broad strokes on complex policies to make himself appear smarter. Depending on your perspective, Biden is in the middleweight or welterweight class.\\n\\nTrump, however, is the heavyweight champion of falsehoods. Trump repeats false statistics on everything, almost as if to will them to be facts. He frequently seems to inhabit a world of his own creation, spreading conspiracy theories and assuming the worst of his foes.\\n\\nWhen the fact-checking is completed after tonight’s debate, it likely will not be scored as an even match.\\n\\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\\n\\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\\n\\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/september-11-biden-trump/2020/09/10/dc2f3524-f2d4-11ea-b796-2dd09962649c_story.html', 'Full Text': 'Biden nonetheless found ways to make his point — that institutions like Congress and NATO are bulwarks against such assaults on democracy. “I refuse to be part of letting these bastards win,” Biden said that day.\\n\\nHundreds of miles to the north — and four miles from Ground Zero — Donald Trump was sitting in a tower bearing his name, watching CNBC and preparing to call a local TV station to offer his own commentary, including a lament that the stock market was forced to close.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNineteen years later, Trump and Biden are their respective party’s presidential candidates, and both will visit Shanksville, Pa., on Friday, the place where United Airlines Flight 93 crashed into a field. It will bring the two candidates to the same place on the same day, a rare occurrence, and it comes less than three weeks before they face off in their first debate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Sept. 11 attacks targeted the cities that molded the two men, Washington and New York, reinforcing the clashing worldviews they now offer the American electorate: Biden’s embrace of U.S. institutions and global alliances, Trump’s distrust of foreigners and insistence that America must go it alone.\\n\\n“Their responses fundamentally demonstrated the one perpetual, personal and political divide between them,” said Aaron David Miller, who served in the State Department under both Democrats and Republicans, citing this contrast between collective action and unilateralism.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat divide is playing out amid another great national trauma, one Americans are handling in a very different way. If 9/11 prompted a rare moment of national unity — with Republican and Democratic leaders embracing on the Senate floor — the current pandemic is yielding bitter partisan debates over everything from death rates to who’s at fault.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe events, of course, are very different, one a massacre by terrorists bent on humiliating America and the other a global pandemic that recognizes neither borders nor ideology. Nearly 3,000 people died in the 2001 attacks, and close to 190,000 Americans have lost their lives so far to covid-19, the disease caused by the novel virus.\\n\\nOn Friday, Biden and Trump will appear on a field that memorializes the bravery and toughness of ordinary Americans, epitomized by the cry of “Let’s roll” as passengers attempted to retake the cockpit. Trump is scheduled to attend a 9:45 a.m. ceremony, which is closed to the public but will be streamed online. Biden’s campaign announced Thursday evening that he would be in New York on Friday morning for a ceremony at the 9/11 Memorial & Museum, before traveling to Shanksville in the afternoon.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut if that moment in 2001 was about unity, it contained the seeds of this era of division, at least when it comes to the two men facing off on Nov. 3.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBiden and Trump have only hardened their divergent approaches in the years since. For Trump, the attacks have fueled his skepticism of foreigners, led to Islamaphobic reactions, and cemented a distrust of traditional alliances, from NATO to the World Health Organization. For Biden, it enhanced his faith in the importance of the Western alliance and triggered calls for bipartisan unity that he still voices.\\n\\nOn Sept. 11, 2001, Biden’s daughter, then a college student, called him, begging him to leave Washington. The senator instead marched to the Capitol, reaching the steps before a police officer stopped him and told him a fourth plane — the one that would eventually crash in Shanksville — was heading toward Washington and, some thought, the Capitol.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Damn it, I want to go in,” Biden recalled telling the officer. Instead, the senator, who then chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was forced to angrily sit on a park bench and make calls on his cellphone.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBiden pushed back against pleas that members of Congress relocate to a bunker in West Virginia. He spoke by phone with President George W. Bush that evening, urging him to come back to Washington.\\n\\n“Everyone was bemoaning life was changed forever — that was not Biden’s attitude,” said Brian McKeon, a longtime aide who was with him that day. “This was not going to inalterably change the American way of life. He’s talking NATO and alliances — that was part of his instinct. America shouldn’t ever undertake a significant action like responding to al-Qaeda attack on our own.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat night, Biden and his brother, Jimmy, hitched a ride home with Rep. Robert A. Brady (D-Pa.), who was heading to Philadelphia. Unlike most lawmakers, Biden still returned to his home every night in Delaware.\\n\\nBiden watched on television as congressional leaders — the ones he urged earlier in the day to come together in a visible way and hold their proceedings as scheduled — sang “God Bless America” outside the Capitol.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I sort of felt bad that I was sitting in Wilmington, watching them sing ‘God Bless America’ on the steps of the Capitol building and promising to be back in session the next day,” Biden wrote in his 2007 book “Promises to Keep.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs with Trump, the attacks did not so much transform Biden’s worldview as solidify it.\\n\\n“What I saw was a Biden who was not particularly spectacular or innovative in his thinking,” said Michael O’Hanlon, a foreign affairs specialist at the Brookings Institution. “But also someone very solid in how he wanted to proceed, knowing that overthrowing governments is a messy proposition and the instability it would create.”\\n\\nThe most volatile foreign policy question after 9/11 was whether to launch a war in Iraq, and both Biden and Trump appear to have exaggerated their initial opposition to it in the years since. Still, Biden was consistently skeptical of Bush’s conduct of the war and warned the challenges could be greater than expected.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“He tends to be pretty wary about the use of force,” O’Hanlon said. “And — maybe the other piece of this 77-year-old man’s worldview — he is old enough to remember Vietnam.” He added, “Biden is a bit slower to the trigger. To be fair, so is Trump. Trump is a bellicose personality, but he doesn’t actually seem to like war.”\\n\\nOn the day of the attack, Trump was watching CNBC as it prepared to interview former General Electric CEO Jack Welch, when the network cut away to a scene of the first tower on fire. One of his first reactions when the planes hit was to call a television show to offer commentary.\\n\\nHe later visited Ground Zero, and he cited the attacks to challenge immigration policies, religious tolerance and the need for the very global alliances that Biden has spent years embracing.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump claimed that he saw the plane strike the second tower, and that from his window he observed the tragedy of people jumping from the buildings — claims that fact-checkers have questioned. Trump also later said he watched as thousands of Muslims cheered in Jersey City, N.J., when the building came down, an assertion that has been debunked.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat is clear about Trump’s reaction is that he called into WWOR in New Jersey to offer his commentary.\\n\\n“I was so disappointed when they closed the stock exchange, but of course at some point you had no choice,” Trump said. “You want to just say the hell with it, you’re going forward, nothing is going to change. But the fact is something has changed, very dramatically.”\\n\\nHe also remarked that a building he owned had been the second-tallest in Manhattan but, now that the Trade Towers had fallen, would become the tallest. (That was inaccurate — a different building actually held that title).\\n\\nTrump was asked what he would do if he were president.\\n\\n“Well, I’d be taking a very, very tough line,” Trump said. “This just can’t be tolerated. And it’s got to be very, very stern. This was . . . probably worse than Pearl Harbor.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut while the terrorists struck just miles from where he lived, Trump has rarely spoken with passion or emotion about Sept. 11, 2001. An exception came during a 2016 Republican primary debate when Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) criticized him for “New York values.”\\n\\n“When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on arth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely, than New York,” Trump said. “You had two 110-story buildings come crashing down. I saw them come down. And we saw more death, and even the smell of death, nobody understood it. And it was with us for months, the smell, the air. And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan.”\\n\\nBut more often, Trump is dispassionate.\\n\\n“From various comments he made that day and the period after, there is nothing that really indicates this is fundamentally changing his outlook on the world,” said Thomas Wright, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who has written about Trump’s foreign policy.\\n\\nThe formative period in Trump’s foreign policy occurred in the 1980s, and in many ways stemmed from his businessman outlook. In that decade, he started publishing ads and making statements saying, for example, that the U.S. had become a laughingstock on trade.\\n\\nThe 9/11 attacks only seemed to play into his philosophy that the U.S. must go it alone and look after its own interests.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/eu-proposes-immigration-deal-that-would-require-countries-to-take-a-share-of-asylum-seekers-or-assist-in-deportations/2020/09/23/2b126ef4-fd0c-11ea-b0e4-350e4e60cc91_story.html', 'Full Text': 'But the proposal nods at the political divisions within the bloc and is full of concessions to hard-line nations that have resisted accepting migrants, even with flows down more than tenfold from the peak.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“We all have to step up,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said as she unveiled the package in Brussels. “It is now time to rise to the challenge to manage migration jointly.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe proposal, which was drawn up by the European Commission, the E.U.’s bureaucratic arm, still must be approved by the leaders of the 27 E.U. member nations, who routinely demand changes to such plans.\\n\\nRecent European history is full of dead-on-arrival migration plans, but some analysts said Wednesday that this one comes at a time of slightly increased cooperation. Far-right parties, though still relevant, have lost some momentum in recent years. Data from Germany, which opened its doors widely and controversially in 2015, paints an encouraging picture of how refugees can integrate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLeaders are also operating with a fresh reminder of Europe’s grave problems. A fire this month razed the continent’s largest, most notorious camp for asylum seekers, on the Greek island of Lesbos. About 10,000 people from the destroyed Moria camp now live in a hastily built tent camp on the island.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“In a way, it’s a key moment. If this migration pact doesn’t work, it’s the last roll of the dice,” said Andrew Geddes, director of the Migration Policy Center at the European University Institute in Florence. “Europe will have tried and tried again.”\\n\\nGerman Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who has been critical of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s open-door refugee policy in the past, described the plan as a “fresh start” and called on other European countries to do their bit.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“There is currently no functioning European migration policy,” he said. “The events in Moria recently made this clear to us.”\\n\\nThis plan differs from an earlier, failed European attempt — drawn up in the aftermath of the 2015 crisis — that called for countries to host asylum seekers based on a quota system. In this instance, countries can still volunteer to host people.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut they also have other, far different options. Notably, they can opt to sponsor the deportation of rejected asylum seekers, essentially taking responsibility for shepherding the onerous process. If a sponsor country is unable to return the migrant, it would then have to host him or her.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe option could be more appealing to countries such as Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Austria, which revolted against the quota idea and are traditionally the least welcoming to migrants.\\n\\nBut advocates for migrants’ rights, as well as some politicians, accused the European Union of twisting its values by offering deportation as an alternative to hosting asylum seekers. Guy Verhofstadt, a Belgian member of the European Parliament, said on Twitter that the European Union could not afford to base its policies on “extremism” in Hungary and Poland.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJudith Sunderland, acting deputy director of the Europe and Central Asia division at Human Rights Watch, said that entrusting countries such as Hungary to care for would-be deportees was like “asking the school bully to walk the kid home.”\\n\\n“It’s this lowest-common-denominator approach, satisfying everybody at least a little bit,” Sunderland said of the plan.\\n\\nA spokesman for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was noncommittal in his response to the plan Wednesday, saying in a statement that “we should form alliances with countries of origin, so that they are able to provide proper living standards and ensure that their people do not have to leave their homelands,” a suggestion that echoes in the proposal.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Hungary does not support obligatory distribution,” wrote the spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, stopping short of endorsing the plan.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEuropean Commission leaders said deportations were another way to ensure that the broader migration system was running smoothly, without bottlenecks.\\n\\nThe heightened focus on deportations is a response to changes in who has been arriving. Whereas in earlier years many were fleeing war-torn Syria — and almost universally earning protection in Europe — a growing number now are deemed economic migrants, not eligible for legal status. In one of the documents released Wednesday, the European Commission noted that the share of migrants coming from countries with low recognition rates for legal protection has risen from 13 percent in 2015 to 55 percent in 2018.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGroups that deal with migrants expressed concern Wednesday that some of Europe’s proposals, such as an attempt to fast-track deportations, could lead to increased detention, rights abuses and the mistaken return of at-risk people.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe plan calls for fast-track border procedures in which people with “low chances” for asylum are rapidly screened.\\n\\n“They will have their return decision very quickly, and they will be returned,” said the European commissioner for home affairs, Ylva Johansson. “I think this will have people think twice before paying a lot of money to smugglers and before risking their lives going into these dangerous boats.”\\n\\nEurope has struggled to carry out deportations, despite numerous pledges to improve numbers. Only about a third of people who are given deportation orders are actually sent to their home countries. Countries in the Middle East and Africa, from where most migrants to Europe originate, have been reluctant to accept returns. In some cases, their economies rely on remittances from workers in wealthier countries. Countries also feel that Europe has not done enough to offer legal pathways for their citizens to come on student or work visas.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHanne Beirens, director of the Migration Policy Institute Europe in Brussels, said it was a “blemish” on Europe that the continent has had such a hard time overhauling its migration system, even as the level of arrivals has become far more manageable. Even now, humanitarian rescue boats in the Mediterranean are often stuck for days as countries squabble over whether to accept the boat at port — and what to do with the migrants who arrive.\\n\\n“We can’t be seen as scrambling and not knowing what to do when even a small boat arrives,” Beirens said. “If you look at the numbers now, they are manageable. This is something the E.U. should be able to manage. But because of the deep distrust of member states to make even the slightest move that could be seen as weakness, we have a very stalled process.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-not-a-swing-state/2020/09/18/9741e2e4-f843-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html', 'Full Text': 'But Virginia isn’t getting the swing-state treatment this time around. As in-person early voting got underway Friday, Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden were dark on broadcast television. Super PACs were clogging somebody else’s airwaves. Even as Trump and Biden have resumed limited travel amid the coronavirus pandemic, neither has stumped in the commonwealth.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“There’s really no discussion about the state being in play,” said Amy Walter, national editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. “If you’re Ohio or New Hampshire, or Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, you’ve always been in that spotlight. Virginia got it for such a short period of time.”\\n\\nThe last time presidential candidates stayed out of Virginia and off its airwaves was 2004. The state was reliably red then, having backed Republicans for the White House every year since 1968. Now Virginia seems to be getting the cold shoulder because it’s considered solidly blue.\\n\\n“Virginia was the belle of the ball in 2008, and again in 2012, and still once more in 2016, but in 2020, the commonwealth is a wallflower,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a University of Mary Washington political scientist.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDaniel Palazzolo, a University of Richmond political scientist, described Virginia’s moment as a top-tier swing state as unusually fleeting. “Normally . . . if a state’s a battleground state, it stays that way for a longer period of time than this one,” he said.\\n\\nDemographic trends — immigration and a population boom in the well-educated, affluent Northern Virginia suburbs — had been nudging the state into purple territory for years. The rise of Trump threw that into overdrive, as non-White and college-educated voters recoiled from what they saw as “a toxic combination of ideology and style,” political scientist Larry J. Sabato said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Looking forward, the question is whether the Democratic gains in the suburbs are semi-permanent or how much of that shift is being driven by President Trump,” said Nathan Gonzales, editor and publisher of the nonpartisan Inside Elections.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Trump and Biden campaigns insist they are making a real push for Virginia’s 13 electoral college votes.\\n\\nBoth candidates tweeted at Virginians on Friday as early voting began in the state.\\n\\n“The future of our country is on the ballot, and your voice is absolutely critical to deciding who we are as a nation,” Biden tweeted.\\n\\nIn a string of tweets, Trump promised a “Big Rally in Virginia,” predicted victory and touted some of the state’s GOP candidates for Congress.\\n\\nHe also took aim at Gov. Ralph Northam (D), saying he is “crazy” and wants to “take away your guns, which he will do without me in office.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNortham signed a host of gun-control bills into law this year. None will “take away” guns from lawful owners, unless those owners are deemed an immediate threat to themselves or others.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump went on to say Northam “is in favor of executing babies after birth.”\\n\\nRepublicans accused Northam of advocating infanticide in January 2019, following comments he made in a radio interview related to a late-term-abortion bill.\\n\\nA former Army doctor and pediatrician, Northam appeared to be talking about end-of-life care for a newborn that is “not viable,” but he has never clarified his remarks. Northam has called the infanticide allegation wrong and “disgusting.”\\n\\nNortham responded to Trump with a tweet referencing news reports that the president has disparaged veterans — an allegation Trump has called “fake news.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Like so many Virginians, I wore the uniform of my country,” Northam tweeted. “We aren’t suckers or losers. And by the way — we vote.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNortham also tweeted that he’d proudly voted that morning for Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.).\\n\\nThe volley of tweets injected a little fire into Virginia’s race, but it was expected to quickly fizzle out.\\n\\nNeither campaign would disclose its number of paid staffers in the state, a metric typically trumpeted as a sign of strength. But Trump’s team said it has 5,000 volunteers and noted that Vice President Pence gave a speech to Virginia Military Institute cadets on Sept. 10. Biden’s campaign has reserved nearly $1.5 million in Virginia television ad time for October, according to the nonprofit Virginia Public Access Project.\\n\\n“Virginia is one of 17 battleground states that we’re investing in around the country,” said Samantha Cotten, a regional spokeswoman for the Trump campaign.\\n\\nJohn Fredericks, a conservative radio host who was Trump’s 2016 Virginia chairman, said Trump volunteers are engaging in the door-knocking and rallies that Biden’s team has largely scrapped because of the pandemic. He said that grass-roots organizing is more critical than television ads in Virginia, where the strategy is not to sell skeptics on Trump, but to get every last one of his supporters to the polls.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“This election is not about persuasion. It’s about mobilization,” said Fredericks, who led a rally inside a Lexington restaurant on the eve of Pence’s visit to VMI. “And we’re mobilizing like I’ve never seen before.”\\n\\nFormer Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe (D), who has helped promote Biden with virtual events, was skeptical of Trump’s efforts in Virginia.\\n\\n“The only ground game he’s got going on is 18 holes on the golf course,” McAuliffe quipped.\\n\\nBiden’s campaign said it has been engaging voters with virtual meetings, such as the online rally Biden’s wife, Jill Biden, headlined Monday. It has formed various coalitions — African Americans for Biden, Women for Biden, Jewish Americans for Biden, and — for Hispanics — Todos Con Biden. All the coalitions meet virtually.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It’s probably a bluer state, but our campaign just isn’t running that way. We aren’t taking a single vote for granted, especially in this unprecedented environment,” said Chris Bolling, Biden’s Virginia director, referring to the pandemic and new state voting laws that give voters more options for how to cast their ballots.\\n\\nVirginia Democrats rode a wave of anti-Trump sentiment to retain the governorship, capture three more congressional seats and win the state House and Senate over the past three years.\\n\\nWhile Republican congressional candidates are trying to cite Democratic gains as reason to flip some of the state’s newly blue districts back to red, Northam said his party has used its newfound power in Richmond in ways that should reflect well on Biden.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Virginians, I think, are really looking for leaders that will deliver and will take action,” he said, noting legislation Democrats passed to expand access to health care, restrict guns and protect the environment.\\n\\nVirginia was the only Southern state Trump lost four years ago, falling five points behind Clinton. Biden was 10.9 points ahead of Trump in Virginia this week, according to an average of presidential polling by FiveThirtyEight.\\n\\n“When you’re getting consistent double-digit leads over time, I guess you just want to try to put your efforts where they seem to make sense,” said Farrah Stone, poll director at Virginia Commonwealth University’s Center for Public Policy.\\n\\nHaving backed every Republican from Richard Nixon to George W.

Virginia also ranked fourth in campaign events with the presidential or vice-presidential candidates.\\n\\n“The Republican National Committee bent over backwards to give us everything we needed to compete in Virginia,” said Bill Bolling, a former Republican lieutenant governor who was Romney’s Virginia chairman.\\n\\nIn 2016, Virginia was an on-again, off-again battleground.

His approach contrasts sharply with the bubbling anger among many Democrats over Republican tactics regarding the Supreme Court, a fury that began on the left but is seeping into the party’s mainstream.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs Trump has made it clear that he intends to fill the court vacancy as swiftly as possible, Biden’s restraint is the result of several days of discussion inside his campaign. He showed on Monday that he sees little advantage in becoming embroiled in what’s shaping up as a bare-knuckle fight bound to send Americans into their partisan corners.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nInstead, Biden delivered a broad populist message including a direct appeal to Trump voters. “I know many of you are frustrated. You’re angry,” he said. “You believe you weren’t being seen, represented or heard. I get it. It has to change. And I promise you this: It will change with me.”\\n\\nIn a call with Democratic congressional aides on Monday, Biden’s team urged them to connect the Supreme Court vacancy to broader issues such as health care and immigration, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Several Democratic leaders have argued that a new conservative justice could mean the end of the Affordable Care Act, which faces a challenge before the court.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBiden’s approach raises the question of how he would react if Senate Republicans reject his pleas to step back from the brink and instead push ahead with confirmation hearings. If that happens, as seems likely, Biden will face great pressure from his liberal flank to adopt the more belligerent stance he has been studiously avoiding.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWith few legislative options to block a confirmation, Democratic leaders are edging closer to threatening moves that have long been considered off limits. They are signaling that if they capture the White House and Senate, they might expand the Supreme Court by adding new justices and filling those slots with liberals.\\n\\nThat reflects a broader anger at what many in the party feel is a breakdown in the rules of American democracy — from gerrymandering to the electoral college, from the filibuster to attacks on voting. That has prompted more support for moves including ending the filibuster and creating statehood for Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, which are heavily Democratic.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBiden — who has staked his candidacy largely on returning to normalcy, protecting institutions and forging bipartisanship — has been reluctant to consider such ideas. When asked Monday by WBAY-TV in Green Bay whether he would consider adding more justices, Biden said he did not want to engage.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It’s a legitimate question, but let me tell you why I’m not going answer that question,” Biden said. “Because it will shift the focus. That’s what [Trump] wants. He never wants to talk about the issue at hand and he always tries to change the subject. Let’s say I answer that question, then the whole debate’s going to be about what Biden said or didn’t say, Biden said he would or wouldn’t.”\\n\\nBut others in the party are increasingly expressing openness to such legislative options. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), appearing with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) at the steps of Ginsburg’s former high school in New York on Sunday, was asked about expanding the Supreme Court and responded by saying that “once we win the majority, God willing, everything is on the table.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) spoke Monday at an online kickoff of a new coalition of civil rights groups focused on goals such as expanding the Supreme Court, ending the filibuster, terminating the electoral college and granting statehood to D.C.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAsked why Democrats should push to change the court, Warren cited the 2018 confirmation battle over Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who had been accused of sexual misconduct when he was a student, something he forcefully denied, and then echoed Schumer’s words from the night before.\\n\\n“Leader Schumer is right. Everything should be on the table,” Warren said.\\n\\nDemocrats are particularly frustrated that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused to consider President Barack Obama’s 2016 Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, who was nominated eight months before the election, but is rushing to secure a Trump pick just weeks before Election Day.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOne Biden adviser said over the weekend that the campaign was considering adding some nuance to Biden’s response that would not completely close the door to adding justices. “He’s going to make a really powerful case that it shouldn’t have to come to that,” said the adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal talks. “He’s going to make the case for de-escalation.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBiden did not take questions from reporters after his Wisconsin appearance. He gave an address on Sunday that focused on Ginsburg, but he did not take questions at the end.\\n\\nBiden’s campaign has been coordinating with Democratic leaders in the House and Senate over the past several days, according to a campaign aide. Biden has made public appeals to Republican senators, asking them to help him avoid a crisis. He apparently has not called them directly.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAides to a number of key Senate Republicans — including Mitt Romney of Utah, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey O. Graham of South Carolina — said they have not heard from Biden. A spokeswoman for Lisa Murkowski of Alaska would not say whether Biden and the senator had spoken.\\n\\nBrian Fallon, executive director of the group Demand Justice, which is working to make the courts more liberal, said he wishes that Biden would release a list of potential Supreme Court nominees, something the presidential nominee has steadfastly refused to do.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStill, Fallon said he is not distressed by what he is hearing from Biden.\\n\\n“I don’t expect Joe Biden to talk about it,” he said of expanding the court. “If you’re the Biden campaign, this is not the main message. I think they are smart to focus on the impact” of court fights over issues such as Obamacare.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBiden’s job is to win in November, he said, and it is the job of activists to press these issues.\\n\\nStasha Rhodes, the campaign director for 51 for 51, which supports D.C. statehood, said her group is pushing to make expanding the court part of the national discussion about replacing Ginsburg. “People are talking more openly about it now,” said Rhodes. “We have to make up for the seats that have already been stolen by McConnell and Republicans.”\\n\\nIn the past, Biden has been adamantly opposed to the idea of expanding the Supreme Court, and the question is whether circumstances will now force him to soften his opposition. Some critics have warned of a scenario where each party expands the court every time it regains control of the Senate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I’m not prepared to go on and try to pack the court, because we’ll live to rue that day,” he told Iowa Starting Line in July 2019.\\n\\n“We begin to lose any credibility the court has at all,” he said in an October debate. “I would not pack the court.”\\n\\nSome Democrats say that even if most voters care little about the court itself, Ginsburg was unique: a justice who was crafted into an action figure, became the subject of movies, and evolved into a pop culture sensation known as the Notorious RBG. Her death, they argued, could galvanize voters in a unique way, especially women younger than 40.\\n\\nBut that activity is occurring without Biden.\\n\\n“This is our stand. Everything the last four years has led to this moment,” said Rachel Carmona, chief operating officer of Women’s March, which co-hosted a vigil at the Supreme Court on Saturday night. “No Democratic response should be off the table, including expanding the Supreme Court. We are in a life-and-death struggle for the soul of our country, and we should use any means necessary.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAlexis McGill Johnson, the president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said Democrats should focus more on what unites them — stopping a Trump nominee from getting confirmed — than on the things that could divide them, such as expanding the court.\\n\\n“What’s important is to stay focused on the fight ahead,” she said. “Our focus is that this seat under no circumstances should be filled until after Inauguration Day.”\\n\\nIn a CNN poll in August, 39 percent of registered voters said nominations to the Supreme Court were extremely important to their vote, on par with race relations (40 percent), gun policy (40 percent) and health care (41 percent). The economy and health care were the top issues in the poll at 47 percent apiece, while climate change was lowest at 24 percent.\\n\\nIn a national survey conducted earlier this month by the Marquette Law School, a narrow majority of respondents opposed expanding the Supreme Court, with 46 percent favoring it and 53 percent against.\\n\\nBiden made his comments Monday in Manitowoc, Wis., on a trip meant to appeal to Obama voters who fled to Trump in 2016. It was his second trip to Wisconsin, a state that Trump won by about 27,000 votes four years ago to become the first Republican presidential candidate to carry the state since 1984.\\n\\nStriking a populist tone, Biden argued that Trump poses as a man of the people but is in fact an elitist who cares only about the wealthy and Wall Street. He reiterated that if he wins, he would be the first president in decades who has not attended an Ivy League school.\\n\\n“I think it’s about time that a state school president sat in the Oval Office,” Biden said. who received a bachelor’s degree from the University of Delaware and a law degree from Syracuse University. “Because you know what? If I’m sitting there, you’re going to be sitting there, too.”\\n\\nBiden, who was wearing a mask in accordance with Wisconsin health protocols, also remarked on Trump’s rallies, saying the president endangers his supporters and has contempt for them.\\n\\n“He loves his rallies. The next time he holds one, look closely,” Biden said. “Trump keeps his distance from anyone at the rally.

But in a groundbreaking decision on their case late last month, Canada’s federal court ruled that the pair, an unidentified couple known in court documents only as AP and AM, can meet the legal definition of a “conjugal relationship,” a government designation for unmarried couples.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCanadian legal advocates and lawyers are now cheering the ruling as a major victory for the rights of what many have called “mixed-orientation couples,” with some saying it validates experiences that have long been pushed to the margins of the law.\\n\\n“Societally, we’re so used to sex as the defining aspect of a relationship,” the couple’s lawyer, Athena Portokalidis, told The Washington Post. “But if a definition would fit for an opposite-sex that has been married for 50 years, why can’t a same-sex couple or a mixed-orientation couple have it, too?”\\n\\nThe ruling hinges on a particular part of the Canadian immigration and family law systems, which both tend to be more progressive and inclusive than their U.S. equivalents.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut it nonetheless casts a light on a family arrangement that is present — if equally unacknowledged — south of the border. The Straight Spouse Network, a Chicago-based organization that focuses exclusively on supporting the heterosexual partners in such marriages, estimates that there may be as many as 2 million such couples in the United States, Vice reported in 2014.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIndeed, Portokalidis said the idea of mixed-orientation couples is nothing new: Any bisexual person dating or married to someone who is attracted to only one gender is in a mixed-orientation relationship. So is someone in a heterosexual marriage in which one spouse has just come out.\\n\\nYet, the idea of two adults entering into a partnership without some kind of sexual or romantic bond nonetheless challenges many conventional beliefs around what makes a partnership. It is on this logic that a lower court rejected AP and AM’s spousal sponsorship application.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut in her Sept. 17 decision granting them an appeal, Justice Janet M. Fuhrer said Canada’s Immigration Appeal Division had acted with a “reliance on stereotypes” in rejecting their case.\\n\\n“The IAD’s decision was based on a closed mind or bias,” Fuhrer wrote, “resulting in an unreasonable assessment of the evidence.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRather than considering the details at hand about their partnership, she added that the lower court “focused exclusively” on “predetermined conclusions about the ability of mixed-orientation couples to engage in sexual relations.”\\n\\nAccording to court documents, AP was granted asylum in Canada because he had been persecuted in his home country because of his sexual orientation. (That country is not specified in court documents, and Portokalidis declined to name it to protect her client’s privacy.)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt that point, he reconnected with AM online. They went on vacation together about seven years ago and engaged in unprotected sex. She told him she was pregnant in January 2014.\\n\\nFrom then on, with AP in Canada, they decided to raise the baby together despite the borders separating them. They went on two more trips: once during AM’s pregnancy, and again once their child was 2 years old. The pair talks regularly over Skype, Portokalidis said, and — with AM’s applications for a visa having twice been rejected — AP sends money to support AM and their child.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnder Canadian law, a conjugal relationship is a way of recognizing the bond between unmarried cohabitants, Nicholas Bala, a law professor at Queen’s University in Ontario, told The Post. The concept can be used in the Canadian immigration system to reunite gay couples coming from countries where their sexual orientation is frowned upon or illegal.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBala said that the ruling does not change or expand the definition. To meet the definition, a couple must prove that they rely on each other and maintain some degree of intimacy but do not necessarily need to be sexually intimate.\\n\\nYet in June 2019 when deciding on AP and AM’s case, immigration officials said they were not persuaded “a homosexual man and a heterosexual woman are able to meet the sexual component of conjugal partnership.”\\n\\nWhen the pair appealed their case, they were again rejected by the IAD. AM did not know enough about AP’s prior relationships, the court said, and AP did not come out to AM until after their child was born — all signs that they did not maintain the kind of close, intimate communication necessary for a conjugal partnership.\\n\\nBut Portokalidis, who pointed to the Netflix series “Grace and Frankie” as an example of mixed-orientation partnerships, said she hopes the decision can create greater visibility for a group of people who are often unacknowledged.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/donald-trump-father-will/', 'Full Text': \"“It was basically taking the whole estate and giving it to Donald,” Trump’s sister said in secretly recorded audio.\\n\\nDonald Trump was facing financial disaster in 1990 when he came up with an audacious plan to exert control of his father’s estate.\\n\\nHis creditors threatened to force him into personal bankruptcy, and his first wife, Ivana, wanted “a billion dollars” in a divorce settlement, Donald Trump said in a deposition. So he sent an accountant and a lawyer to see his father, Fred Trump Sr., who was told he needed to immediately sign a document changing his will per his son’s wishes, according to depositions from family members.\\n\\nIt was a fragile moment for the senior Trump, who was 85 years old and had built a real estate empire worth hundreds of millions of dollars. He would soon be diagnosed with cognitive problems, such as being unable to recall things he was told 30 minutes earlier or remember his birth date, according to his medical records, which were included in a related court case.\\n\\nNow, those records and other sources of information about the episode obtained by The Washington Post reveal the extent of Fred Trump Sr.’s cognitive impairment and how Donald Trump’s effort to change his father’s will tore apart the Trump family, which continues to reverberate today.\\n\\nThe recent release of a tell-all book by the president’s niece Mary L.

In a deposition, Donald said he had no idea his father was suffering from dementia, saying his father was “very, very sharp” at the time.

Do you recall him exhibiting any confusion in 1991? A. No.\\n\\nThen, within months of Trump’s effort to amend his father’s will, Fred Trump Sr. was formally diagnosed with “early stages of dementia,” according to medical records that were disclosed in a 2000 court case brought by Mary Trump and others seeking a larger inheritance from the elder Trump’s estate. In that case, Donald Trump and two of his siblings were deposed.\\n\\nMary Trump on Thursday filed suit in a New York court against Donald Trump, Barry and the estate of their brother Robert Trump, alleging that they — as executors of their father’s estate — later deceived her about the “true value” of what she believes she should have inherited. Her complaint said she was “fleeced” out of “tens of millions of dollars or more.”\\n\\nMary Trump said in a statement to The Post that Donald Trump’s initial effort to change his father’s will when his mental state was in decline is still relevant today because it shows how he put his own interests above even those of his own family members.\\n\\n“As demonstrated by his willingness to alter his father’s will illicitly and in secret, there are no limits to Donald’s unethical behavior,” she said. “Because doing so benefited Donald, however, he had no compunction about deceiving his father in order to defraud his own siblings.

Fred Trump Sr. sent a lawyer to one of his son’s casinos with a check for $3.35 million, which paid for 670 gambling chips worth $5,000 a piece, according to a New Jersey regulator’s report. The maneuver funneled desperately needed cash into the casino.\\n\\nDonald Trump, right, waits with his brother Robert for the start of a Casino Control Commission meeting in Atlantic City in 1990, seeking final approval for the Taj Mahal casino. (AP)\\n\\nBut it still wasn’t enough. A string of six corporate bankruptcies would follow. Fearing that his future inheritance would be seized, Donald Trump came up with his plan for an amendment, known as a codicil, to his father’s will.\\n\\nWhile Trump had been expected to be the lead executor in an initial version of the will, this amendment would have broadened that role, according to Mary Trump’s account in her book. She wrote that the codicil would have put his siblings “at Donald’s financial mercy, dependent on his approval for the smallest transaction.”\\n\\nDon Novick of Novick & Associates, an expert on New York estate law who reviewed the documents at The Post’s request, said: “It gave [Donald Trump] an enormous amount of authority he didn’t have in the original will. It gave him essentially full control to do whatever he wanted to run these businesses and to use estate and trust assets for that purpose.”\\n\\nThe codicil, reported by the New York Times in 2018 as part of its investigation into the family’s tax-avoidance measures, also was designed to protect Donald Trump’s inheritance from efforts to seize it by creditors and Ivana.\\n\\nTrump’s uncontested divorce from Ivana was finalized in December 1990, with cruel and inhuman treatment by Donald Trump cited as the grounds. The division of property was then to be decided. Ivana had originally asked for $2.5 billion, half of Trump’s estimated worth, but his lawyers said her prenuptial agreement allowed her to receive less than 1 percent of his assets. (A private settlement eventually would be reached. Ivana Trump said in a brief telephone conversation: “I have no idea what Donald Trump and his father did. I have no comment.”)\\n\\nSecurity guards escort Mary MacLeod Trump, Donald Trump's mother, as she arrives for lunch at a New York restaurant in 1990. (Mario Cabrera/AP)\\n\\n‘You’re not signing anything’\\n\\nDonald Trump asked a lawyer, Peter Valente, to write the codicil, according to Barry’s deposition in the 2000 case. (Valente said he could not discuss the matter due to attorney-client privilege.) Then, instead of presenting the proposal to his father, Trump said in the deposition that he sent two of his father’s most trusted associates to make the pitch in December 1990. They were Fred Sr.’s lawyer, Irwin Durben, and his accountant, Jack Mitnick.\\n\\nDurben died in 2016. Mitnick declined to comment.\\n\\nWhen Durban and Mitnick brought the codicil to Trump’s father for his signature, Trump’s mother, Mary MacLeod Trump, looked at the document and told her husband, “You’re not signing anything until I have had a chance to read it,” Barry said in the recording made by her niece.\\n\\nMaryanne Trump Barry’s deposition from 2000 inheritance case Q. Can you tell us when you first became aware of that document? A. I first became aware of this document when my father called me and said he had been given this document by Irwin Durben and Jack Mitnick and asked to sign it and he said he didn’t like what he saw in there and he wanted me to take a look at it. Q. Do you know approximately when that phone call was? A. It wasn’t, I am trying to remember. It was either late 1990 or early 1991 and I have a distinct recollection of him bringing the document to me when we were down at my brother Donald’s house in Florida for a weekend that early 91. Early 91 maybe. But in any event, he called me on it and brought it to me because he was disturbed by what he read.\\n\\nAfter Fred Trump Sr. refused the request to sign the document, he called Barry. Fred Sr. later met with his daughter, showed her the proposed codicil and said he was annoyed at the way Donald had tried to use two trusted advisers to get him to “sign it immediately,” according to Barry’s deposition in the 2000 case.\\n\\nAs father and daughter discussed the document, Barry said, they concluded that it would mean “Donald has sole control of everything as the executor/trustee, can sell, do anything he wants, you know, with the properties,” Barry said in her deposition.\\n\\nMaryanne Trump Barry’s deposition from 2000 inheritance case Q. So he [Fred Trump Sr.] expressed to you some sort of concern that by dint of the instrument putting Donald in control of the assets, even as his capacity as fiduciary, that somehow creditors of Donald would be able to attach the assets? A. Right. Rightly or wrongly, that’s how he perceived it and that is how it looked to me too.\\n\\n“Dad was concerned because although he always had the highest respect for Donald and admiration for him, this was a time when Donald was in precarious financial straits by his own admission and Dad was very concerned as a man who worked hard for his money and never wanted any of it to leave the family,” she said.\\n\\n“He said to me . . . ‘This doesn’t pass the smell test,’ ” Barry said. “Here’s his attorney giving him something that he reads [that] could potentially denude his estate and he was annoyed that should happen that way.” It was done “behind his back, he had not authorized it, didn’t know they were going to give it to him for signature.”\\n\\nIt was left to Barry to tell Donald Trump that their father was killing the codicil. Years later, Trump, who rarely admits a mistake, said in a deposition that “I blame myself” for the way he sought the change in the will.\\n\\nDonald Trump deposition from 2000 inheritance case Q. Did Mr. Mitnick ever tell you what aspect or aspects of the whole episode your father found annoying, if I can use that word? A. I think the presentation was not handled properly and he didn’t know Mr. Valente, didn’t feel comfortable having a lawyer that he never met putting a codicil in front of him and that was it. He wasn’t happy about it and I blame myself for that because I think the presentation was probably, in retrospect, not done right but I had a lot of things on my mind at that the point and this is not the biggest thing at all.\\n\\n“My father wasn’t happy about it,” Trump said in his deposition. “The man was very, very sharp and wanted to know, you know, who the lawyer was. He wanted to read the document, wanted to get to understand the document and in the end he just didn’t like maybe the concept of the document or didn’t like the way it was presented or he just wanted to review the whole situation.”\\n\\nBy the spring of 1991, Fred Trump Sr. was working on the new will that made Donald Trump a co-executor of the estate, along with two of his siblings, Robert, who died August 15, and Maryanne. (The other siblings are Fred Jr., who is Mary’s father and died in 1981, and Elizabeth, who was not an executor of her father’s estate and thus not actively involved in the matter.)\\n\\nA photograph of Fred Trump Sr., President Trump's father, sits in the Oval Office in 2019. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\\n\\nAnother fight\\n\\nIt was at this time that a new question came up: What would be given to the two children of Fred Trump Jr., Donald’s older brother, who had died in 1981 of an alcohol-related disease?\\n\\nMary and Fred III went to court in 2000 to argue that Fred Trump Sr. was not of sound mind when Donald and his siblings sought changes in the will in September 1991 that led to their effective disinheritance.\\n\\nTo bolster their case, they obtained medical and other records that showed Fred Trump Sr. was increasingly in mental decline. Mary said in an affidavit that her grandfather suffered from “senile dementia” and alleged that the will was “the product of undue influence and coercion” by Donald Trump and his siblings.\\n\\nRobert Trump, Donald’s younger brother, said their father had been in “notable decline” in his cognitive ability starting in 1990, the year that Donald wanted his father to sign the codicil, according to medical records.\\n\\nRobert Trump’s deposition from 2000 inheritance case A. My father was very angry that a document, again, a document which I had never seen nor was I aware of it, but a document had been presented to him for signature almost as if it was a fait accompli , and evidently the preparers of the document were Mr. Durben and Mr. Mitnick, and I later learned it was also Mr. Valente, whoever he was. And my father was quite unhappy that they had not had the courtesy and the professionalism to tell him that they were working on something, truly on his behalf as well as Donald’s behalf, and gave it — gave him a document and said, sign this and we’ve got to get it fast, sign it. And when he read it I don’t believe he understood it completely. So he was very unhappy with those two individuals particularly.\\n\\nThen in October 1991, Fred Trump Sr. went to see one of his physicians, C. Ronald MacKenzie. The doctor wrote in his report that Fred Trump Sr. had “significant memory impairment” and showed “early signs of dementia.” In his notes, MacKenzie wrote that Trump Sr. had “obvious memory decline in recent years.” MacKenzie declined to comment.\\n\\nIn February 1992, Fred Trump Sr. underwent a neuropsychological evaluation by Rajendra Jutagir. The doctor wrote in the report, which is included in court records, that Fred Trump Sr. “did not know his birth date, was unsure of his age, and turned to his son [Robert] for help in responding to some questions.”\\n\\nJutagir’s exam found that the senior Trump’s cognitive ability was below the 15th percentile for a person in his age group. He could not recall what he was told 30 minutes earlier, the report said. He was given standard tests and failed or performed poorly. He was able to recall only three of the previous nine U.S. presidents. He was unable to draw hands on a clock to show a requested time. After reading a story, he could only remember one detail out of 23. Jutagir could not be reached for comment.\\n\\nRajendra Jutagir’s report Memory: Immediate recall of stories read to him was poor relative to his achievement. Although norms are not well established for his age group, conservative estimation suggests performance below the 15th percentile. After a delay of 30 minutes recall of stories was nil. Immediate recall of a story that he read to himself was also impaired as he could remember only one detail (out of a possible 23), and showed evidence of mild confabulation. From a 1992 medical record about Fred Trump Sr.\\n\\nDespite all of this, Donald Trump insisted in his deposition that he never saw or heard of any evidence of his father’s mental decline during this time.\\n\\n“Do you recall him being diagnosed as having senile dementia in 1991?” Trump was asked by a lawyer in the deposition.\\n\\n“No,” Trump responded.\\n\\n“Do you recall him exhibiting any confusion in 1991?” the lawyer asked.\\n\\n“No,” Trump said.\\n\\nThen, when the lawyer asked Trump to look at a doctor’s report from October 1991 that said his father “has mild senile dementia,” Trump said he knew nothing about it.\\n\\n2000 Donald Trump deposition Q. Let’s look at the exhibit. On Page 3, under the entry in the middle of the page, October 3rd of 1991, the 3rd paragraph next to the last sentence. “He [Fred Trump Sr.] has mild senile dementia.” You indicated before you had never heard of that. Does this in any way refresh your memory that some doctor made such a diagnosis on October 3rd of 91? A. No. Q. And you never heard it at any time thereafter through the end of 1993? A. No, I have not.\\n\\n(When asked during the 2016 campaign about dementia in his family, Trump said on “The Dr. Oz Show” that his father developed signs of Alzheimer’s disease only in “the last few years” before dying in 1999.)\\n\\nMary Trump said in an affidavit in her 2000 case that the executors of Fred Trump Sr.’s estate, including her uncle Donald, had “lied in the probate proceeding” about the elder Trump’s mental health and coerced the elder Trump to effectively disinherit her and her brother.\\n\\nTrump and his brother Robert led an effort against a challenge to the will made by Mary and her brother, Fred III, saying they would withdraw medical care that was being provided by a Trump company to Fred III’s son, William, who had cerebral palsy. Donald Trump told the New York Daily News that after he was sued by Mary and Fred III over the will, he decided, “Why should we give [William] medical coverage?”\\n\\nMary Trump’s 2000 Affidavit At the time, my uncle [Robert Trump] reported to the neuropsychological examiner that my grandfather’s memory had been in “notable decline” for the past two years. This is the same man who swore at his deposition, as did his brother and sister, that his father was mentally fit at the time he made his Will.\\n\\nIn the end, Mary and Fred III settled the inheritance fight and signed confidentiality agreements.\\n\\nBut Mary said this year she wasn’t bound by secrecy because of what she had learned about the value of the estate. Based on records she provided to the New York Times, she said she had been told the estate was worth $30 million when it was actually worth closer to $1 billion. She said she began to secretly record her aunt in an effort to extract knowledge about what Mary considered the family’s deception.\\n\\nThe fallout, as it turns out, had been foreshadowed by one of Fred Trump Sr.’s advisers, whose name is not disclosed in court records. In 1991, the adviser wrote him a memo that referred to the way he was effectively disinheriting Mary Trump and her brother. Suggesting that he consider giving them a more equitable share of the inheritance, the adviser wrote: “You may wish to increase their participation in your estate to avoid ill will in the future.”\\n\\nThe elder Trump ignored the advice.\\n\\nNearly 30 years later, Mary Trump, still upset over the inheritance battle and deeply at odds with her uncle’s political views, published her book with the title “Too Much and Never Enough.”\"}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-plans-to-sign-executive-order-on-preexisting-conditions/2020/09/23/21b89340-fd1d-11ea-830c-a160b331ca62_story.html', 'Full Text': 'He is expected to mostly avoid speaking about repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, something he has long promised to do but a position that is \\xadunpopular with voters.\\n\\nAdvisers also expect Trump to sign an executive order promising to protect people with preexisting conditions as part of Thursday’s event, though the administration has not detailed how this objective could be achieved without the safeguards in President Barack Obama’s signature 2010 health-care law, according to another senior administration official. Experts have said such an executive order would amount to little more than a public relations ploy, and the order is not viewed as a substantive policy proposal among many West Wing advisers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDespite making lowering drug prices and repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act key planks of his 2016 election bid, Trump has struggled to deliver on many of his health-care promises in his first term. He trails Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in polls on health-care issues.\\n\\nThe goal is not necessarily to beat Biden on health care — even some of the most optimistic Trump aides do not see that as possible — but instead to close the polling gap on the issue while touting others on which the president has an advantage, such as the handling of the economy, according to people familiar with the discussions who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.\\n\\n“In almost every way we can test health care, it continually is at the top of people’s concerns, and it consistently polls to the advantage of Biden and the Democrats down ballot,” said Guy Cecil, who leads Priorities USA, a liberal group that has blanketed the airwaves with advertisements against Trump on health care. “It’s going to take more than repeatedly promising they are going to have a plan in two weeks over and over again.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe president has signed a flurry of executive orders in recent months and repeatedly promised a “great” health plan that he hopes will help win over seniors, but he has failed to release such a proposal. His aides have also made last-minute pushes for concessions from the pharmaceutical industry, including an attempt to convince drugmakers to give seniors $100 coupons before the election, according to two people familiar with the discussions.\\n\\nThe White House declined to comment on the contents of the president’s Thursday speech. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany responded to questions for this article by defending the president’s record on health care and blasting Democrats’ policy plans, claiming they will amount to a “government takeover of health care” and higher taxes.\\n\\nTrump “will continue to deliver these results and more in a second term,” she said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHealth care had once been a political albatross for Democrats because of early problems with the ACA website, rising premiums on the individual market set up by the law, and Republican complaints that it was enacted in a less than transparent manner, according to strategists in both parties. Trump repeatedly fixates on Obama’s promise that patients could keep their doctors under the ACA, which turned out to be false for some people.\\n\\n“The turning point in all of the health-care conversations was the attempt by congressional Republicans and Trump to overturn Obamacare,” Cecil said, referring to the failed efforts to scrap the law shortly after Trump took office. “It crystallized for people what was actually at stake. Americans started paying attention to what was actually in Obamacare.”\\n\\nCecil added that in recent polls conducted by his group in six battleground states — Wisconsin, Florida, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Michigan — health care and the coronavirus were among voters’ top five concerns, with health care leading among all White women, a key voting bloc. Trump’s perceived attacks on Social Security and insurance for those with preexisting conditions were the No. 1 and No. 2 issues cited by female voters in these states, he said. The president has said he will protect both.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA national Kaiser Family Foundation poll completed after the Democratic and Republican conventions showed Biden with a 13-point advantage when it comes to determining the future of the Affordable Care Act and a 14-point lead on maintaining protections for people with preexisting conditions. But Trump had a slight edge on lowering prescription drug costs; 46 percent of voters said the president had a better approach, while 42 percent favored Biden. Biden had a six-point advantage on lowering the overall cost of health care for individuals.\\n\\nRepublican National Committee and campaign polls have consistently shown Trump trailing Biden on health care among voters in key states. One such poll of battleground states this spring had Biden with a double-digit lead on lowering health-care costs, drug policy and protecting Social Security and Medicare.\\n\\nThe administration’s problems on health care have been exacerbated, officials said, by the president’s handling of the pandemic, which has generally received poor marks from voters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe president has told advisers that he wants to “fight” on health care, knowing it is a political vulnerability, and advisers have urged him repeatedly to promise that he will maintain protections for those with preexisting conditions. At times, he has berated health-care officials, saying that the issue is hurting him politically, White House officials said.\\n\\nTrump’s speech Thursday and the pressure on his advisers come as Biden has sought to focus his campaign on Trump’s handling of the pandemic and the future of the ACA, after Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death last week added fresh uncertainty for the future of the law that extended health insurance to some 20 million Americans. The high court is set to hear oral arguments on the latest bid to strike down the entire law — a suit brought by 18 Republican states that is backed by the Trump administration — on Nov. 10, one week after the election.\\n\\nSenate Republicans are likely to replace Ginsburg with a conservative justice, changing the balance of the court for years. In previous challenges to the ACA, the court’s four liberal justices and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. upheld the law.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe upcoming Supreme Court decision is the best chance that Trump and the Republican Party have had to fulfill their 10-year promise to repeal the ACA. But it could be a politically perilous victory because Republicans have yet to propose how they would stop millions of Americans from being thrown off their health-care plans if the law is repealed.\\n\\nCongressional efforts to scrap the law in 2017 were hugely unpopular and brought the ACA’s popularity to record levels, making Trump and Republicans eager to avoid the topic altogether. Trump has privately told advisers that the push, in the beginning of his term, was a mistake.\\n\\nDemocrats were able to take back the House in 2018 on a message of protecting Americans’ access to health care, a strategy Biden and Senate Democrats are working to replicate this year.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump has tried to shift voters’ attention to his efforts to lower prescription drug prices — evident earlier this month when he signed two executive orders that the pharmaceutical industry had spent months trying to fend off. Still, experts say it remains highly unlikely that Trump will be able to implement policies that would affect voters before the Nov. 3 election.\\n\\n“It is difficult to see any of these executive orders actually resulting in lower prices for consumers before the election,” said Chris Meekins, an analyst at financial firm Raymond James and a former official at the Department of Health and Human Services in the Trump administration. “The one area of health care voters trust Trump more than Biden is on lowering drug prices. The Trump campaign wants that to be the main issue for health-care voters — not something like the desire by the Trump administration to kill the ACA at the Supreme Court.”\\n\\nTrump and White House officials have regularly said over the course of his presidency that a health care plan will be ready in “two weeks,” but have yet to deliver one.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPressed this week whether such a plan actually exists, McEnany said it does without offering any specifics.\\n\\n“The president will be laying out some additional health-care steps in the coming, I would say, two weeks,” she told reporters.\\n\\nThere has long been sharp dispute in the administration on what a health-care plan should look like. For several months late last year and early this year, former Domestic Policy Council director Joe Grogan convened regular meetings on health care with White House and agency officials to try to deliver on Trump’s long-promised plan. But no comprehensive plan ever came out of the meetings, which were derailed in February because of the pandemic response.\\n\\nMeetings were regular, officials said, but too many people with too many different ideas were involved. Some aides wanted to spend more, while others wanted to spend less.\\n\\nTrump does not have a deep understanding of the health-care system, according to current and former advisers, and the topic does not animate him like some others, such as trade or immigration policy.\\n\\nWhite House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows has been a proponent of the prescription drug executive orders, but they have faced some resistance from some conservative members of the administration, who fear they are bad policy.\\n\\nCurrently working on health care initiatives is Theo Merkel, a National Economic Council aide, and staffers on the domestic policy council.\\n\\nTrump’s most recent action on health care included two executive orders that would tie the prices U.S. consumers pay for some drugs to the lower ones paid in several other countries where governments have the power to set prices — a proposal that is anathema to most congressional Republicans. The administration first rolled out such a proposal that would affect some beneficiaries of Medicare Part B, which applies to drugs administered in doctor’s offices, about two years ago.\\n\\nTrump expanded the breadth of the orders after growing angry in recent weeks at drug industry ads criticizing him in several swing states, current and former officials said, further driving his push to hit the industry. The second executive order unexpectedly applied the proposal to Medicare’s much larger Part D program, which is used for prescription drugs that patients take at home.\\n\\nThe order took several White House aides by surprise, highlighting the administration’s disorganized approach to health care. Many aides said it was not good policy from a conservative administration.\\n\\nThe proposals are fraught for several reasons, including because they may run afoul of the federal rulemaking process leaving them open to legal challenges.\\n\\nThe administration “talks a big game about drug pricing but doesn’t really do anything, which is what’s been happening for the last three years,” said Rachel Sachs, a law professor at Washington University at St. Louis.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/09/22/us-ambassador-pete-hoekstra-netherlands-embassy-fvd/', 'Full Text': 'On Monday, Dutch magazine De Groene Amsterdammer published a detailed description of the Sept. 10 gathering, attended by a large group of Forum for Democracy (FvD) members and supporters in the business community, bringing it to widespread attention.\\n\\nHoekstra defended the event in a tweet Wednesday, saying that he had held similar events with other parties but he had never hosted a fundraiser for a political campaign.\\n\\nBut Dutch lawmakers had argued that the Sept. 10 event blurred the line between a typical embassy event and a fundraising gathering for the FvD — a potential breach of international law, which prohibits interference in domestic politics.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nParty attendees told De Groene that entrepreneurs constituted around 40 percent of the crowd, some of whom had already donated to the FvD, and that the invitations included contact details for Joyce Vastenhouw, who is listed as “Head of Fundraising” for the party on LinkedIn.\\n\\nThe invitation gave guests a particular impression, according to the magazine’s assessment: The “evening at the embassy, \\u200b\\u200bon American soil, had as one of the goals to supplement the Forum’s party budget.”\\n\\nSjoerd Wiemer Sjoerdsma, a member of parliament and foreign policy spokesman for Democrats 66, a liberal party in the Dutch coalition government, raised the issue at parliament Tuesday and called on the Foreign Ministry to investigate whether Hoekstra had “facilitated a fund raising event for a political party.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“That would be a violation of the Treaty of Vienna,” Sjoerdsma said in a message to The Washington Post, referring to the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations — an international agreement to which the United States and the Netherlands are signatories.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSven Koopmans, a member of parliament for the governing People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, or VVD, and its spokesman for foreign affairs, said that many political parties had worked with Hoekstra on events, but he added that if the “U.S. Embassy was used for a fundraising event for [the FvD], or whether perhaps that party used the ambassador’s invitation for fundraising purposes, that would not be proper.”\\n\\nOther Dutch lawmakers offered a more blunt perspective. “This is interference in our elections,” Bram van Ojik, a member of parliament with the left-wing GroenLinks, or GreenLeft, party, told public broadcaster Nederlandse Omroep Stichting.\\n\\nThe FvD’s controversial positions — as well as Hoekstra’s fraught relationship with some in the Netherlands — probably furthered the backlash.

Fred Trump Sr. sent a lawyer to one of his son’s casinos with a check for $3.35 million, which paid for 670 gambling chips worth $5,000 a piece, according to a New Jersey regulator’s report.

Fearing that his future inheritance would be seized, Donald Trump came up with his plan for an amendment, known as a codicil, to his father’s will.\\n\\nWhile Trump had been expected to be the lead executor in an initial version of the will, this amendment would have broadened that role, according to Mary Trump’s account in her book. She wrote that the codicil would have put his siblings “at Donald’s financial mercy, dependent on his approval for the smallest transaction.”\\n\\nDon Novick of Novick & Associates, an expert on New York estate law who reviewed the documents at The Post’s request, said: “It gave [Donald Trump] an enormous amount of authority he didn’t have in the original will. It gave him essentially full control to do whatever he wanted to run these businesses and to use estate and trust assets for that purpose.”\\n\\nThe codicil, reported by the New York Times in 2018 as part of its investigation into the family’s tax-avoidance measures, also was designed to protect Donald Trump’s inheritance from efforts to seize it by creditors and Ivana.\\n\\nTrump’s uncontested divorce from Ivana was finalized in December 1990, with cruel and inhuman treatment by Donald Trump cited as the grounds. The division of property was then to be decided. Ivana had originally asked for $2.5 billion, half of Trump’s estimated worth, but his lawyers said her prenuptial agreement allowed her to receive less than 1 percent of his assets.

(Valente said he could not discuss the matter due to attorney-client privilege.) Then, instead of presenting the proposal to his father, Trump said in the deposition that he sent two of his father’s most trusted associates to make the pitch in December 1990. They were Fred Sr.’s lawyer, Irwin Durben, and his accountant, Jack Mitnick.\\n\\nDurben died in 2016. Mitnick declined to comment.\\n\\nWhen Durban and Mitnick brought the codicil to Trump’s father for his signature, Trump’s mother, Mary MacLeod Trump, looked at the document and told her husband, “You’re not signing anything until I have had a chance to read it,” Barry said in the recording made by her niece.\\n\\nMaryanne Trump Barry’s deposition from 2000 inheritance case Q. Can you tell us when you first became aware of that document? A. I first became aware of this document when my father called me and said he had been given this document by Irwin Durben and Jack Mitnick and asked to sign it and he said he didn’t like what he saw in there and he wanted me to take a look at it. Q. Do you know approximately when that phone call was? A. It wasn’t, I am trying to remember. It was either late 1990 or early 1991 and I have a distinct recollection of him bringing the document to me when we were down at my brother Donald’s house in Florida for a weekend that early 91. Early 91 maybe. But in any event, he called me on it and brought it to me because he was disturbed by what he read.\\n\\nAfter Fred Trump Sr. refused the request to sign the document, he called Barry. Fred Sr. later met with his daughter, showed her the proposed codicil and said he was annoyed at the way Donald had tried to use two trusted advisers to get him to “sign it immediately,” according to Barry’s deposition in the 2000 case.\\n\\nAs father and daughter discussed the document, Barry said, they concluded that it would mean “Donald has sole control of everything as the executor/trustee, can sell, do anything he wants, you know, with the properties,” Barry said in her deposition.\\n\\nMaryanne Trump Barry’s deposition from 2000 inheritance case Q. So he [Fred Trump Sr.] expressed to you some sort of concern that by dint of the instrument putting Donald in control of the assets, even as his capacity as fiduciary, that somehow creditors of Donald would be able to attach the assets? A. Right. Rightly or wrongly, that’s how he perceived it and that is how it looked to me too.\\n\\n“Dad was concerned because although he always had the highest respect for Donald and admiration for him, this was a time when Donald was in precarious financial straits by his own admission and Dad was very concerned as a man who worked hard for his money and never wanted any of it to leave the family,” she said.\\n\\n“He said to me . . . ‘This doesn’t pass the smell test,’ ” Barry said. “Here’s his attorney giving him something that he reads [that] could potentially denude his estate and he was annoyed that should happen that way.” It was done “behind his back, he had not authorized it, didn’t know they were going to give it to him for signature.”\\n\\nIt was left to Barry to tell Donald Trump that their father was killing the codicil. Years later, Trump, who rarely admits a mistake, said in a deposition that “I blame myself” for the way he sought the change in the will.\\n\\nDonald Trump deposition from 2000 inheritance case Q. Did Mr. Mitnick ever tell you what aspect or aspects of the whole episode your father found annoying, if I can use that word? A. I think the presentation was not handled properly and he didn’t know Mr. Valente, didn’t feel comfortable having a lawyer that he never met putting a codicil in front of him and that was it. He wasn’t happy about it and I blame myself for that because I think the presentation was probably, in retrospect, not done right but I had a lot of things on my mind at that the point and this is not the biggest thing at all.\\n\\n“My father wasn’t happy about it,” Trump said in his deposition. “The man was very, very sharp and wanted to know, you know, who the lawyer was. He wanted to read the document, wanted to get to understand the document and in the end he just didn’t like maybe the concept of the document or didn’t like the way it was presented or he just wanted to review the whole situation.”\\n\\nBy the spring of 1991, Fred Trump Sr. was working on the new will that made Donald Trump a co-executor of the estate, along with two of his siblings, Robert, who died August 15, and Maryanne. (The other siblings are Fred Jr., who is Mary’s father and died in 1981, and Elizabeth, who was not an executor of her father’s estate and thus not actively involved in the matter.)\\n\\nA photograph of Fred Trump Sr., President Trump's father, sits in the Oval Office in 2019.

Mary said in an affidavit that her grandfather suffered from “senile dementia” and alleged that the will was “the product of undue influence and coercion” by Donald Trump and his siblings.\\n\\nRobert Trump, Donald’s younger brother, said their father had been in “notable decline” in his cognitive ability starting in 1990, the year that Donald wanted his father to sign the codicil, according to medical records.\\n\\nRobert Trump’s deposition from 2000 inheritance case A. My father was very angry that a document, again, a document which I had never seen nor was I aware of it, but a document had been presented to him for signature almost as if it was a fait accompli , and evidently the preparers of the document were Mr. Durben and Mr. Mitnick, and I later learned it was also Mr. Valente, whoever he was. And my father was quite unhappy that they had not had the courtesy and the professionalism to tell him that they were working on something, truly on his behalf as well as Donald’s behalf, and gave it — gave him a document and said, sign this and we’ve got to get it fast, sign it. And when he read it I don’t believe he understood it completely. So he was very unhappy with those two individuals particularly.\\n\\nThen in October 1991, Fred Trump Sr. went to see one of his physicians, C. Ronald MacKenzie. The doctor wrote in his report that Fred Trump Sr. had “significant memory impairment” and showed “early signs of dementia.” In his notes, MacKenzie wrote that Trump Sr. had “obvious memory decline in recent years.” MacKenzie declined to comment.\\n\\nIn February 1992, Fred Trump Sr. underwent a neuropsychological evaluation by Rajendra Jutagir. The doctor wrote in the report, which is included in court records, that Fred Trump Sr. “did not know his birth date, was unsure of his age, and turned to his son [Robert] for help in responding to some questions.”\\n\\nJutagir’s exam found that the senior Trump’s cognitive ability was below the 15th percentile for a person in his age group. He could not recall what he was told 30 minutes earlier, the report said. He was given standard tests and failed or performed poorly. He was able to recall only three of the previous nine U.S. presidents. He was unable to draw hands on a clock to show a requested time. After reading a story, he could only remember one detail out of 23. Jutagir could not be reached for comment.\\n\\nRajendra Jutagir’s report Memory: Immediate recall of stories read to him was poor relative to his achievement. Although norms are not well established for his age group, conservative estimation suggests performance below the 15th percentile. After a delay of 30 minutes recall of stories was nil. Immediate recall of a story that he read to himself was also impaired as he could remember only one detail (out of a possible 23), and showed evidence of mild confabulation. From a 1992 medical record about Fred Trump Sr.\\n\\nDespite all of this, Donald Trump insisted in his deposition that he never saw or heard of any evidence of his father’s mental decline during this time.\\n\\n“Do you recall him being diagnosed as having senile dementia in 1991?” Trump was asked by a lawyer in the deposition.\\n\\n“No,” Trump responded.\\n\\n“Do you recall him exhibiting any confusion in 1991?” the lawyer asked.\\n\\n“No,” Trump said.\\n\\nThen, when the lawyer asked Trump to look at a doctor’s report from October 1991 that said his father “has mild senile dementia,” Trump said he knew nothing about it.\\n\\n2000 Donald Trump deposition Q. Let’s look at the exhibit. On Page 3, under the entry in the middle of the page, October 3rd of 1991, the 3rd paragraph next to the last sentence. “He [Fred Trump Sr.] has mild senile dementia.” You indicated before you had never heard of that. Does this in any way refresh your memory that some doctor made such a diagnosis on October 3rd of 91? A. No. Q. And you never heard it at any time thereafter through the end of 1993? A. No, I have not.\\n\\n(When asked during the 2016 campaign about dementia in his family, Trump said on “The Dr. Oz Show” that his father developed signs of Alzheimer’s disease only in “the last few years” before dying in 1999.)\\n\\nMary Trump said in an affidavit in her 2000 case that the executors of Fred Trump Sr.’s estate, including her uncle Donald, had “lied in the probate proceeding” about the elder Trump’s mental health and coerced the elder Trump to effectively disinherit her and her brother.\\n\\nTrump and his brother Robert led an effort against a challenge to the will made by Mary and her brother, Fred III, saying they would withdraw medical care that was being provided by a Trump company to Fred III’s son, William, who had cerebral palsy. Donald Trump told the New York Daily News that after he was sued by Mary and Fred III over the will, he decided, “Why should we give [William] medical coverage?”\\n\\nMary Trump’s 2000 Affidavit At the time, my uncle [Robert Trump] reported to the neuropsychological examiner that my grandfather’s memory had been in “notable decline” for the past two years. This is the same man who swore at his deposition, as did his brother and sister, that his father was mentally fit at the time he made his Will.\\n\\nIn the end, Mary and Fred III settled the inheritance fight and signed confidentiality agreements.\\n\\nBut Mary said this year she wasn’t bound by secrecy because of what she had learned about the value of the estate. Based on records she provided to the New York Times, she said she had been told the estate was worth $30 million when it was actually worth closer to $1 billion. She said she began to secretly record her aunt in an effort to extract knowledge about what Mary considered the family’s deception.\\n\\nThe fallout, as it turns out, had been foreshadowed by one of Fred Trump Sr.’s advisers, whose name is not disclosed in court records. In 1991, the adviser wrote him a memo that referred to the way he was effectively disinheriting Mary Trump and her brother. Suggesting that he consider giving them a more equitable share of the inheritance, the adviser wrote: “You may wish to increase their participation in your estate to avoid ill will in the future.”\\n\\nThe elder Trump ignored the advice.\\n\\nNearly 30 years later, Mary Trump, still upset over the inheritance battle and deeply at odds with her uncle’s political views, published her book with the title “Too Much and Never Enough.”\"}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/15/trailer-first-state-goes-last/', 'Full Text': '“I\\'m running because I think everybody deserves universal health care and guaranteed housing,” Scarane told Mary Matthews, 57. “We need a $15 minimum wage.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“At least!” Matthews said. “Just let me be able to find you after voting, though.

She got 35 percent of the vote after spending less than $200,000, revealing that there was a base for left-wing politics in a state politically dominated by moderate suburbanites.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“There\\'s people who may have voted in that race had Kerri gained traction earlier, which is one reason we started earlier,” said Scarane, who announced her bid last November. “There\\'s definitely been a shift in favor of things like Medicare-for-all and a Green New Deal among Democrats in this state.”\\n\\nThe nomination of Joe Biden, who endorsed Coons and appears on his literature, revealed the intraparty limits of that agenda. (“I like Coons the best,” Biden told reporters Monday after casting an early vote.) The left saw 2018 as a building year in Delaware, finding potential voters and linking together volunteers who could at the very least win lower-turnout elections down the ballot.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Coons-Scarane race has not attracted the same national investments as the Carper-Harris race, when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigned in Wilmington and Justice Democrats lent staff and money for the primary challenge. Both have ignored this race, viewing others as more winnable, with the New York-based Working Families Party providing the biggest out-of-state muscle for Scarane. But the campaign itself claims to have tapped 1,200 volunteers, knocked 40,000 doors and made 900,000 calls using the Democratic voter file, while WFP has run digital ads against Coons as part of down-ballot investments in Delaware.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Progressive donors, who used to support national Democrats but weren\\'t as active at the local level, have been activated,” said WFP\\'s Mid-Atlantic political director Vanessa Clifford, who co-managed the 2018 Harris campaign. “There weren\\'t many serious challengers before Kerri\\'s run two years ago.”\\n\\nScarane\\'s case against Coons is simple, even if it takes some explaining at the doors. Elected in 2010, Coons has voted reliably with Democrats on their major priorities but prioritized bipartisan work while rejecting the agenda associated with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Like other Justice Democrats, Scarane puts the blame on corporate PAC money — she refuses it — and argues that Coons would impede the party\\'s agenda if it took back power. Like Harris, she\\'s tried to make the race a referendum on the “Delaware Way,” in which business-friendly candidates trade their seats but never enact a liberal agenda.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“There are certain people who\\'ve bought into the line that bipartisanship is important, and we need a Congress that gets along,” Scarane said in an interview at her Wilmington home. “But there are other people who see the senator as quick to run to the other side instead of standing with us on the things Democrats should be fighting for.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCoons was not around for the votes that became vulnerabilities for Carper, like the 2002 authorization of war in Iraq. Scarane has focused instead on his support for Senate supermajority rules and questioned his commitment to supporting liberal judges. For evidence, she cites both his reluctance to end the filibuster and his 2013 vote against Debo Adegbile, an attorney nominated by President Barack Obama to help lead the civil rights division of the Justice Department.\\n\\nBoth questions, at the root, ask whether Coons would undermine a post-election liberal agenda. On the filibuster, Coons said he would see where events took the Senate, if Democrats took control and were trying to pass a Biden administration\\'s agenda. Step one was trying to form consensus, and step two was tbd.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“If Minority Leader McConnell — doesn\\'t that sound good? — uses the filibuster to block progress on any sort of legislative progress, then I\\'m not going to stand by and watch,” Coons said, citing immigration and gun safety as legislative priorities with Republican support. “I got to the Senate in 2011, and I\\'m not willing to see repeats of what he did to Obama, when we got nothing done for years.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Adegbile issue was trickier. When Democrats held the Senate, Coons joined every Republican and six other Democrats to block the Obama nominee. Adegbile had argued in a brief that Mumia Abu-Jamal, a death-row inmate convicted of killing a police officer, had been victimized by racially biased jury selection. The Fraternal Order of Police opposed Adegbile, and so did Coons. Reflecting on it now, Coons said, he should have worked harder to get to yes, but he said he was unable to square Adegbile\\'s record with his feelings over the killing of the officer.\\n\\n“In the run-up to the vote, I had asked Debo if he would call the widow of Dan Faulkner and express some regret about how the whole issue had ended up. And he would not. And I may have overreacted to that. I\\'ve had long conversations with the civil rights community here to say that I recognize that he would have been a great assistant attorney general for civil rights.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnlike Carper, Coons will end the primary without debating his opponent, depriving Scarane of the chance to confront him directly on his votes. But like many other incumbents facing challengers this year, Coons emphasized his liberal bona fides, pitching himself as a Biden ally who could get things done, and he\\'s kept nearly every elected official in the party on his side. Bryan Townsend, a liberal state senator who won his seat by ousting the more moderate Democratic incumbent, argued that Coons\\'s strong reputation with Republican senators positioned him perfectly to be a liberal dealmaker in a Biden-run Washington.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Whatever his portfolio positions are, they come along with a tremendously hard work ethic and an ability to articulate the issues in a way that appeals to a broad number of people,” Townsend said. “There\\'s a lot to be said for electing someone who is going to be able to hold the institution together from both sides, and make progress. I think in some ways he is taking undue heat for the idea that he isn\\'t ‘progressive’ on this or that issue or sufficiently progressive, because he\\'s focused on trying to figure out what can get done, as quickly as possible.”\\n\\nWhile broadcasting confidence about the race, Coons has spent $4 million on his campaign, most of it on resources that can be turned around for the seven-week general election but much of it to beat Scarane. Two years ago, the left badly underestimated what it would take to beat Carper, as a surge of suburban turnout overwhelmed Harris\\'s 29,406 votes — thousands more than her campaign thought she needed. More than 100,000 Delawareans had requested mail ballots by the end of Monday, and both Scarane and Coons were expecting high turnout.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThey were seeking their final votes in very different ways. On Saturday, Coons visited some outdoor parks where his campaign had rented space for socially distant canvassing and phone-banking. He marveled at Mack McKay, a 79-year-old supporter from his church, who had made tens of thousands of calls, and he gave one caller some advice for her voter conversations: She could mention that he was one of very few Democrats who supported a commission to study reparations.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Friday, Scarane and her supporters were at the doors, having conversations that ranged from polite to promising. Voters had nothing negative to say about Coons, and some had recollections about meeting him. Scarane kept the pitch to the agenda she\\'d take to Washington, always starting by saying the system was “working great for the very wealthy” and seeing where the voter took it.\\n\\n“It sounds like you\\'ve got some good ideas, and we need new blood in there,” said Randi Williams, a 59-year-old lab technician. With a Senate candidate on her doorstep, Williams turned to her chief electoral concern: How would Democrats defeat Donald Trump?\\n\\nReading list\\n\\n“Devastating wildfires out West inject climate change into the presidential campaign,” by Seung Min Kim and Brady Dennis\\n\\nAD\\n\\nClimate change and the 2020 race.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhy Republican legislators are resisting some changes that could get votes counted faster.\\n\\nDems in disarray.\\n\\n“Trump’s first indoor rally in months staged as a rebuke to coronavirus restrictions,” by Anne Gearan and Josh Dawsey\\n\\nThe meaning of a crowded room in Nevada.\\n\\nHow can a mighty field program work with voters stuck at home?\\n\\nIn the states\\n\\nThe very, very long primary season, which started in Texas six months ago, comes to an end today in Delaware.\\n\\nMostly.\\n\\nLet\\'s be sticklers. In Louisiana and Georgia, all-party primaries will be held Nov. 3 — for every major office in the former, and for the seat held by Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R) in the latter. But today\\'s contests in Delaware close the chapter on partisan primaries, and when the votes are in, nearly every two-party matchup in 49 states will be set.\\n\\nMost attention will gravitate to the Coons-Scarane primary, by far the costliest race on the ballot. It\\'s not a rematch, as Coons has never faced a well-funded challenger and Scarane has never run for office before. But in some ways, it\\'s round two of the left\\'s Delaware project, an effort to create a beachhead in a place that has moved away from Republicans during Donald Trump\\'s presidency.\\n\\nThat project began in 2018 with Kerri Evelyn Harris\\'s campaign, and the vote patterns today will reveal whether the left can make more gains with suburbanites. Harris did best in vote-rich New Castle County, winning 37 percent of the vote there, and ran strongest near Newark, home to the University of Delaware. She did worst in the outlying suburbs that vote Republican in general elections and worse still in Delaware\\'s more rural counties, Kent and Sussex. Coons starts out as a heavy favorite in all three counties, and the high number of absentee ballot request and early votes — factors not there in 2018 — suggest a high-turnout election.\\n\\nAfter 2018, Delaware Republicans were locked out of power in the state, a punctuation mark on a long decline. They have not won the state\\'s sole seat in the House of Representatives since 2008, they have not won a Senate election since 1994, and they have been locked out of the governor\\'s office since 1988. The party\\'s recruitment this year doesn\\'t point to much optimism about reversing the decline, especially with a well-liked Joe Biden leading the Democratic ticket.\\n\\nStill, Republicans will field candidates for every major office on the ballot this year. The state GOP has endorsed attorney Julianne Murray for governor, but she\\'s facing five opponents, including state Sen. Colin Bonini, who ran and lost to Democratic Gov. John Carney by 19 points in 2016. Republicans have also endorsed veteran Jim DeMartino and actor Lee Murphy, respectively, to take on the winner of the Democrats\\' Senate primary and two-term Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester.\\n\\nPrimary upsets are possible in each race. DeMartino has been heavily outspent by Lauren Witzke, a pro-Trump activist who’s tweeted the slogan (“WWG1WGA”) of the QAnon conspiracy theory movement and has been adept at getting attention despite the steep odds against her. Though not endorsed by Trump, Witzke tweeted at the president and his son Donald Trump Jr. on Monday, claiming that a child had been egged “by hateful leftists” at one of her campaign events. The president’s son retweeted it.\\n\\nMurphy has raised less than $60,000 for his race, less than Witzke, but far more than his challenger, Matthew Morris. Still, Morris has gotten some attention by pitching himself as “the great American comeback story” — beating an opioid addiction to turn his life around.\\n\\nFurther down the ballot, the left is watching some local primaries closely, to see if they can repeat the breakthroughs they\\'ve been pulling off in other state races for city and legislative offices. The Working Families Party, which has endorsed Scarane, is backing two candidates for Wilmington\\'s city council, Colby Owens and Shané Darby. It\\'s also supporting four candidates in state legislative seats that are likely to go Democratic in November: Madinah Wilson-Anton, Larry Lambert, Marie Pinkney and Eric Morrison. If victorious, Pinkney could become the first Black gay woman in the state legislature; Sarah McBride, a transgender activist running for a safe state Senate seat in Wilmington, could become the state\\'s first trans legislator if she wins today\\'s primary.\\n\\nAd watch\\n\\nAmerican Chemistry Council, “Chris Coons.\" In Delaware, Jessica Scarane\\'s main argument against Sen. Christopher A. Coons is that he\\'s too beholden to campaign donors, especially corporate PACs. One of those business interests has been running ads to boost Coons, asking (as all such ads must ask, to conform to campaign law) voters to “call Chris Coons today and tell him thanks” for backing a stimulus and changes to the supply chain.\\n\\nDonald Trump, “Joe Biden Has Done Absolutely NOTHING for America in 47 Years!” The latest spot from the president\\'s campaign hands the microphone to a woman, never named, who says confidently that Joe Biden could “never handle the economy after covid.” Like many Trump ads, however, it focuses mostly on the economy before the pandemic, citing a headline about “women and minorities return[ing] to the workforce” that ran in The Washington Post 18 months ago.\\n\\nRestoration PAC, “Just Begun.” A super PAC funded almost entirely by Illinois megadonor Richard Uihlein, Restoration has run a string of ads in the Midwest supporting local Republican candidates and making very different arguments against Joe Biden. One ad, running 120 seconds long, reintroduced voters to the plagiarism controversy that sunk Biden\\'s 1988 presidential bid. This one only features Biden in a montage of Democrats who “hate” and “spied on” Trump to encourage the president\\'s base that nothing can stop him. “They hate him because he\\'s unraveling their schemes and draining the swamp, and they despise all those who support his efforts,” a narrator says.\\n\\nYou are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoll watch\\n\\nIf Joe Biden was president, would he have handled the summer\\'s unrest better or worse? (Monmouth, 867 adults)\\n\\nBetter: 45% Worse: 28% Same: 23%\\n\\nThe Trump campaign\\'s “law and order” focus and some decline in the number of coronavirus cases have succeeded in raising the salience of a topic Trump prefers. The problem, here and in other polls, is that it\\'s not a clear winner for the president; it\\'s just less rocky for him than the covid-19 response. By a 37-point margin, down from a 42-margin in June, voters say that Trump\\'s response to protests has made the national situation worse; by a 17-point margin, more voters think Biden would have done a better job handling the protests. Democrats live in fear of another protest developing into a violent riot, but nothing so far has advanced the Trump message that unrest now is a preview of “Joe Biden\\'s America.”\\n\\nWhich candidate has the sharpness and stamina to be president? (CNN/SSRS, 787 likely North Carolina voters)\\n\\nDonald Trump: 50% Joe Biden: 44%\\n\\nNew state polls have produced mostly good news for Biden; he\\'s ahead in every state carried by Hillary Clinton, and in every state Trump won last time by two points or less, the president is trailing. The green shoots are in CNN\\'s question about “sharpness,” a question that has been central to Trump\\'s campaigning even as the message of the week has changed. In both this poll and CNN\\'s poll of Wisconsin, Biden is leading overall and tied or better with Trump when asked who could best tackle crime. The only “issue” lead for the president comes when voters are asked about the candidate\\'s energy and mental strength. That could raise the salience of Biden\\'s Thursday town hall on the network and will definitely raise the stakes in the Sept. 29 debate: The perception of a slow and stumbling Biden is one thing keeping the president in the hunt.\\n\\nPresidential election in Florida (Monmouth, 428 registered voters)\\n\\nJoe Biden: 50% Donald Trump: 45%\\n\\nLast week\\'s Florida polling spurred a Democratic panic over the Latino vote, a source of strength for Hillary Clinton\\'s 2016 campaign that, per NBC/Marist, had moved back to the GOP. Biden\\'s campaign had not taken all the freelance advice offered by Latino strategists — Chuck Rocha, who helped Bernie Sanders win the Latino vote in the primaries, was among the critics — but it had been running Spanish-language ads for months, sparking fresh liberal worries that nothing was working for him. Monmouth\\'s poll finds a very different Florida electorate, almost identical to the 2016 exit polls, which had Clinton winning the state\\'s Latinos by 27 points. The Latino electorate has changed since then, with tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans settling in the state, and Democratic worries are less about converting conservative Cuban American voters than about preventing what happened in 2018: Republicans out-organizing them against the newest Latino voters, erasing Democratic gains elsewhere. Without a shift back, Biden’s resilience with older White voters gives him a lead.\\n\\nVoting wars\\n\\nThird-party candidates lost a string of legal challenges over the past week, encouraging Democrats who saw them as threats to winning some key states — something Republicans didn\\'t really dispute, as they helped the challengers.\\n\\nIn Wisconsin, the Green Party lost its ballot access, after the state Supreme Court affirmed that Greens botched their paperwork, failing to update the home address of vice-presidential nominee Angela Walker. That led to hundreds of petition signatures getting tossed, pushing the Greens off the state\\'s ballot for the first time in the national party\\'s history, but the court deemed it necessary to avoid complicating the sending of absentee ballots, which will begin this week. The Greens dawdled in filing their challenge, during which time county clerks began putting the ballots together.\\n\\n“Even if we would ultimately determine that the petitioners’ claims are meritorious, given their delay in asserting their rights, we would be unable to provide meaningful relief without completely upsetting the election,” wrote the court\\'s majority, with one conservative joining the court\\'s three liberals. “We agree with the [Election] Commission that requiring municipalities to print and send a second round of ballots to voters who already received, and potentially already returned, their first ballot would result in confusion and disarray and would undermine confidence in the general election results.”\\n\\nThe court may still hear a challenge from Kanye West, who was removed from the ballot after evidence showed that the Republican attorney who delivered his paperwork filed it after the deadline. But the rationale provided by the court yesterday suggests that West won\\'t get a pass: Adding his name would force hundreds of thousands of printed ballots to be destroyed or rely on voters who receive them to send them back unused.\\n\\nGreens have also been tossed from the Montana ballot, where Democrats saw their Senate candidate as a threat to Gov. Steve Bullock, and the Rhode Island ballot, where there\\'s little at stake but the party filed too few petition signatures. They are still on Pennsylvania\\'s ballot, but Democrats have appealed a lower court\\'s decision to the state Supreme Court, where their party has elected a majority of the justices. The situation there is the reverse of the story in Wisconsin: Democrats represent the last impediment to the state sending out its historic number of absentee ballots.\\n\\nThe Greens\\' presidential nominee, Howie Hawkins, has continued to campaign despite the ballot challenges. West, who has made only fitful campaign statements since declaring his bid 10 weeks ago, has said nothing about the lawsuits, delegating that work to attorneys. Unless he gets a respite from another court, the rapper will appear on just 12 ballots, three of them in states where he needed only to pay a fee for access. He\\'ll have been removed from nine state ballots that he applied for, with the reasons ranging from insufficient signatures to, in Arizona, his decision to register as a Republican in his adopted home state of Wyoming, voiding his attempt to appear on the ballot as an independent. Just two states where West made the ballot, Iowa and Minnesota, are being contested by both Trump and Biden.\\n\\nCandidate tracker\\n\\nOne of the last weeks before the presidential debates began with a fight over climate change, and continued today with something Democrats aren\\'t actually fighting at all: the Trump administration-brokered “Abraham Accords,” under which two Arab nations that were not at war with Israel formalized their peaceful relations.\\n\\n“We’re here this afternoon to change the course of history,” Donald Trump said at a White House signing ceremony Tuesday afternoon. “After decades of division and conflict, we mark the dawn of a new Middle East.” Joe Biden\\'s campaign has talked little about the accords since initially congratulating the administration for them; the Trump campaign has focused less on the specifics of the accords than on a Norwegian politician nominating the president for a Nobel Peace Prize.\\n\\nThe day before, Trump visited California for a roundtable on the state\\'s response to forest fires while Biden, in Delaware, delivered a speech warning that a second Trump term would lead to policies that make climate change worse. Democrats seized on an exchange between the president and Wade Crowfoot, California\\'s secretary for natural resources.\\n\\n“If we ignore that science and sort of put our head in the sand and think it’s all about vegetation management, we’re not going to succeed together protecting Californians,” Crowfoot said.\\n\\n“Okay,” Trump said. “It’ll start getting cooler. You just watch.”\\n\\n“I wish science agreed with you,” Crowfoot said.\\n\\n“Well, I don’t think science knows, actually,” Trump said. The next morning, in a long interview with “Fox and Friends,” the president suggested that the lack of forest fires in wetter climates, like Austria\\'s, suggested that climate change was not making fires any worse.\\n\\nKamala D. Harris returned to California on Tuesday to survey the damage; Mike Pence campaigned in Wisconsin on Monday. Meanwhile, House Republicans released their “Commitment to America,” a brief but targeted list of policy goals they\\'ll act on if they win.

All 435 House seats are up for grabs, with Democrats favored to retain control thanks to their supercharged fundraising and the president’s political weakness in most suburbs.

Voters in 32 states will weigh in on 115 ballot measures, deciding everything from whether Mississippi will adopt a new state flag to whether California’s ride-share drivers can work as independent contractors.\\n\\nBut the most money and organizing has been poured into the race for president between Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The map of swing states has expanded since the start of the year, but every state where the gap between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton was fewer than four points remains competitive, and potentially decisive: Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. (We have guides to most of those, plus Georgia, Texas and Ohio.)\\n\\nJump to a state summary Select...\\n\\nSearch states search\\n\\nAlabama Plenty of states give Republicans bigger margins than Alabama, but few are more loyal to the party: Sen. Doug Jones is the only Democrat to win statewide since the introduction of the iPad. While the state will allow voters to request mail ballots if they cite the coronavirus as a reason, Democrats rarely win outside the Black Belt that runs across the state and, more recently, in the Jefferson County suburbs that surround the city of Birmingham. The Senate race is the only federal contest both parties are seriously contesting.\\n\\nAlaska Republicans have easily won Alaska in every election since 1968, and the state’s scale, its distance from “the outside” and three electoral votes made campaigning here rare even before the pandemic. Still, Democrats are often competitive in statewide races, and the president won just 51 percent of the vote here in 1996, the weakest Republican vote in 20 years. That has a lot to do with the state’s willingness to back independents and third-party candidates, five of whom will share the ballot with Biden and Trump. Democrats are trying to take advantage of that down the ballot, backing independents in the House and Senate races.\\n\\nArizona One of the heartlands of the modern Republican Party, Arizona has remained stubbornly out of reach for Democratic presidential candidates this century, giving them 44 percent to 45 percent of the vote. The president’s weakness with suburban voters has shaken things up, with Phoenix’s Maricopa County, where more than half of ballots are cast, changing from safely red territory to a toss-up. Republican Sen. Martha McSally has trailed in most polling. Two House districts that cut into Maricopa County, the 1st and 6th districts, could see close races, and Democrats are trying to take over the state Senate ahead of 2021’s redistricting.

Outside of the Mississippi Delta and the greater Little Rock area, Democrats now lose everywhere, and the party lost its only challenger to Sen. Tom Cotton, who’s cruising to his first reelection. Only the 2nd District, which contains Little Rock, could be competitive.\\n\\nCalifornia Trump began his presidency by accusing Californians of casting millions of illegal votes against him, and relations have gone downhill from there. Republicans aren’t really competing for the state’s electoral votes and are focused on winning back the seats lost in the 2018 midterms. They picked up (and are now defending) the 25th District northwest of Los Angeles; they are trying to win back the 21st, 39th and 48th districts, as two other seats that flipped two years ago drew weak Republican challengers.\\n\\nColorado The steady expansion of Denver and its suburbs turned a red state into a purple state, then into a blue state where Republicans struggle to win. Sen. Cory Gardner is now the only statewide Republican elected official here, and Democrats recruited popular, if awkward, former governor John Hickenlooper to face him. Gardner won’t get much help from the president, who has not seriously competed for Colorado this cycle, and while independents outnumber members of either major party, registered Democrats now outnumber registered Republicans by close to 100,000, up from a near-tie in 2016.\\n\\nConnecticut Despite some gains in local and state legislative races, Republicans remain in the deep minority here, and the president has barely paid attention to the state. (He has not visited it at all since 2017.) Much of the state moved toward the GOP in 2016, but the suburbs of New York City raced in the other direction, and the president lost overall by 14 points, pushing the state off the map this cycle.\\n\\nDelaware When Biden first was elected to the Senate here, Richard Nixon was carrying the state by 21 points. That kind of ticket-splitting is unheard of now, and Delaware’s Republicans have been sidelined during the Trump era, with Democrats now in command of every statewide office. The First State has just three counties; Biden has homes in two of them, and neither party doubts he’ll win easily.\\n\\nFlorida Yes, yes, it’s always close. Since 2010, no candidate for president or governor here has won by more than one point or cracked 50 percent of the popular vote. The only one of those races won by a Democrat — Barack Obama’s reelection campaign — put together math that may not work for the party anymore, as the state’s conservative southwest and northwest turn out massive Republican margins. The GOP’s socialism-centric campaign is trying to cut Democratic margins in South Florida (while taking back two House seats), while Democrats are trying to stretch their 2018 suburban gains further into places like Sarasota and Jacksonville.

That was in 1992, and Georgia has added more than 2 million voters since, most of them in Atlanta and its increasingly Democratic suburbs. Republicans are trying to flip back the 6th District, while Democrats are trying to win the neighboring 7th District they nearly flipped in 2018.

The state isn’t being seriously contested, but the open House seat in Indianapolis’s suburbs could be.\\n\\nIowa As every Democratic candidate for president reminded Iowans, their state’s red shift, with working-class towns leaving the party en masse, was the harbinger for 2016. The state is more competitive now, and three of its four House seats are hotly contested, but big swaths of rural Iowa that backed Barack Obama are hostile to his party now.\\n\\nKansas The president won handily here in 2016, but his 56 percent of the vote was the lowest for any Republican nominee in more than two decades. Democrats gained ground in 2018, winning one House seat and the race for governor, and they recruited a moderate former Republican, state Sen. Barbara Bollier, to run for U.S. Senate this year.\\n\\nKentucky Biden has appeared on two Democratic tickets that lost Kentucky by landslides, and that’s unlikely to change this year.

The large number of college-educated White voters is a factor, and refugee-fueled diversity in Minneapolis is another. But the Trump campaign invested heavily here after nearly skipping it in 2016. Read more The five political states of Minnesota Both parties were surprised by what Trump almost pulled off in 2016. And both are investing in the state this year.\\n\\nMississippi This is one of the most racially stratified political states, with more than 80 percent of White voters loyal to Republicans and more than 90 percent of Black votes reliably voting for Democrats. While a higher percentage of Mississippi’s population is Black compared with other states, that’s not enough to make Democrats regularly competitive. Former agriculture secretary Mike Espy, a Democrat, is making a second Senate bid here after losing by single digits in 2018.\\n\\nMissouri A bellwether state until 2008, when it narrowly rejected Barack Obama, Missouri has marched toward the GOP since then, with old Democratic strongholds in the Bootheel region and the center of the state flipping dramatically. Democrats have added votes in the suburbs of Kansas City and St. Louis but only enough to compete for a Republican-drawn House seat.\\n\\nMontana Unionized workers in the western part of the state have made Montana far more competitive than other majority-White parts of the Mountain West. Hillary Clinton lost here by 20 points, but Democrats reelected Gov. Steve Bullock that year, and he’s in one of the year’s most expensive Senate races for a seat Democrats held for decades.\\n\\nNebraska Democrats aren’t very competitive in most of the state and have been beset by problems with candidate selection. But like Maine, Nebraska awards electoral votes to the winners of congressional district, and the Omaha-centered 2nd District has been competitive in every year since 2008.\\n\\nNevada Barack Obama won the state by a landslide in 2008, but Republicans have cut the margins since, running up the score outside of Reno and Las Vegas and winning when they pull ahead in suburbs like Henderson. Democrats swamped them in 2018, but the pandemic has complicated the party’s traditional canvass strategy — one that has led pollsters, for years, to underestimate the party’s advantage with Latinos.\\n\\nNew Hampshire In 2016, the closest Trump-Clinton margin in New England was here, with the Democrat prevailing by a few thousand votes. Republicans were helped by a third-party vote, which has collapsed since then, as Democrats have won locally in the Boston exurbs.\\n\\nNew Jersey Tough for Republicans before Trump, the president’s policies have made it tougher — a backlash to his anti-immigration measures and elimination of a popular tax reduced the GOP to one of 13 House seats. Trump rallied here after one Democrat, Rep. Jeff Van Drew, switched parties, but while his race is close, the Trump-Biden race isn’t.\\n\\nNew Mexico Republicans’ struggles with Latinos and suburbanites have wounded their party badly here, with no nominee since George W. Bush winning more than 43 percent of the vote. A Senate seat is open, but Republican losses around Albuquerque have made it hard for the party to get to 50 percent.\\n\\nNew York The president no longer votes in his home state and is historically unpopular in his hometown. In 2016, Republicans did better in Upstate New York and Long Island; in 2018, they lost House seats but held on to some of those gains. The presidential race is not competitive.\\n\\nNorth Carolina Democrats lost here for decades but narrowly won in 2008, and every race since has been close. Republicans have gained ground in rural areas but lost it in the cities, and a shift in the suburbs of Charlotte and Raleigh has closed up the race. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper is seeking reelection and so is Republican Sen. Thom Tillis. Read more The six political states of North Carolina North Carolina is a microcosm of America: Cities and suburbs have grown bluer, white rural areas have grown redder.\\n\\nNorth Dakota Republicans have taken over completely here, holding every statewide office. Democrats spent some money here in 2008 but haven’t returned, as the party’s environmentalism alienated it from energy industry workers.\\n\\nOhio Democrats misjudged Ohio in 2016, investing time and money into a place where one of the party’s bases — working-class Whites in the Mahoning Valley — had deserted it. The state went for Trump by nine points, with Republicans gaining ground everywhere but around Cincinnati and Columbus. Democrats have struggled for Biden’s attention this year after Ohio didn’t deliver many wins in 2018. Read more The seven political states of Ohio After 2016, it seemed Ohio’s time as a swing state may have been over. But both presidential campaigns are investing there again.\\n\\nOklahoma After the 2008 election, Oklahoma Republicans sent a Christmas card that boasted of the state’s spotless record: Every single county had rejected Barack Obama. No Democratic nominee since Al Gore has won a county here, but Oklahoma County has trended left, and Democratic Rep. Kendra Horn is trying to defend the seat she flipped there.\\n\\nOregon Competitive for years, Oregon was pushed to the left by the growth of Portland. The president hinted he might compete there this cycle, and he briefly made the city’s protest culture into a focus of his campaign, but there is no sign of Republican opportunity.\\n\\nPennsylvania Trump’s appeal in this state has slipped since 2016, when Hillary Clinton’s modest gains in the suburbs of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia were outpaced by Republican gains in the northeast and northwest. Biden’s roots in Scranton were a selling point for Democrats in the primaries, as they hoped even a modest improvement in that region would break Trump’s coalition. Read more The seven political states of Pennsylvania The story in Pennsylvania in 2016 was different than in Wisconsin and Michigan.\\n\\nRhode Island As in the rest of New England, Trump made gains with White working-class voters here while solidly losing non-White voters and suburbanites. Republicans are making no real effort to win it.\\n\\nSouth Carolina Republican strength in the upstate and along much of the Atlantic coast has kept the state safely Republican for decades. Democrats, who win Black voters by a landslide in the state, have made some inroads around the suburbs of Charleston and Columbia, and former party chair Jaime Harrison has raised more money than any Democrat in state history in his race against Sen. Lindsey O. Graham.\\n\\nSouth Dakota Like the rest of the Great Plains states, South Dakota had some Democratic loyalties last decade but swung hard toward the president in 2016. Republican Gov. Kristi L. Noem won narrowly in 2018 but has become widely popular since then, and the state has seen no presidential campaigning.\\n\\nTennessee Al Gore’s home state is now almost entirely hostile to Democratic candidates, as voters in Appalachia and other rural parts of the state have abandoned the party completely. Democrats have made gains in the suburbs of Nashville but far from enough to make the state worth it for Biden to compete in.\\n\\nTexas Democrats’ designs on Texas were a source of Republican mirth for a decade. That changed in 2018, when Democrats made huge advances in the suburbs of every major city and the national party began investing to swing House seats. Biden’s campaign has talked up its commitment to the state without sinking much money into it. Read more The seven political states of Texas Democrats hope a swing toward them in urban and suburban areas can overwhelm Republicans' strength with the state's many rural, White, conservative voters.\\n\\nUtah The Mormon-dominated state was a surprising source of weakness for the president in 2016, with more than one in four voters backing a third-party candidate. But Trump won handily, and only a House race near Salt Lake City is competitive.\\n\\nVermont Bernie Sanders’s state has not been competitive in a presidential election since 1988; four years ago, when around 20,000 Vermonters cast protest votes for Sanders, it did not prevent Hillary Clinton from winning in a landslide.\\n\\nVirginia Republicans have not won anything here since 2009, and Trump has given rocket fuel to the suburban liberals who now dominate state politics. The president has barely tried to win the state, but three House races — around Charlottesville, Richmond and Virginia Beach — are competitive.\\n\\nWashington The state was competitive for years, but the growth of Seattle and its suburbs has put the state out of reach for Republicans; no GOP presidential candidate has carried it since Ronald Reagan. Democrats are defending a House seat in the region they flipped two years ago, while Republican Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler is defending a swing seat on the Oregon border.\\n\\nWest Virginia The days of Mike Dukakis campaigning confidently through the hollers are over: This is now one of the country’s most Republican states, with Trump winning the state by the biggest margin of any GOP candidate in history.\\n\\nWisconsin Like the rest of the Great Lakes states that decided the 2016 election, Wisconsin backed Trump with less than 50 percent of the vote, then went for every statewide Democratic candidate in the midterms. But it was close, in part because Milwaukee’s suburbs, unlike those in many other Midwest cities, remained a fortress for Republican votes.

Hyder and Stewart, which have reported no cases of covid-19, are pushing Canada to designate the region an “integrated trans-border community,” exempt from travel restrictions and quarantines. Lawmakers representing Point Roberts, Wash., and Minnesota’s Northwest Angle have asked Canadian Public Safety Minister Bill Blair to ease and clarify the rules.\\n\\n“This is our local traffic only that we’re advocating for,” said Jane Beaumont, a registered nurse in Stewart who grew up in Hyder and has family there. “We’re not advocating for tourism.”\\n\\nPresident Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau agreed to close the 5,500-mile land border to nonessential traffic in March, and have extended the restrictions in monthly increments ever since. The rules were tightened in July for U.S. travelers transiting through Canada to Alaska for essential travel. The current closure lasts through Oct. 21.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe measures are widely supported in Canada, which has fared far better against the coronavirus than the United States (though several provinces have seen cases climb in recent weeks). The restrictions have had minimal impact on trade, but they’ve hit tourism, split families and upended life in tightly knit border communities in ways big and small that some fear could be permanent.\\n\\nThat’s particularly apparent in Hyder, Alaska’s easternmost town, home to some 60 souls, and Stewart, a comparative metropolis of more than 400. The only way in or out of Hyder is through Stewart or by float plane. Families there rely on Stewart for gas, groceries, laundry, firewood and electricity. They set their clocks to Stewart time. Their phone numbers use the B.C. area code.\\n\\nEach July 1, when a pandemic isn’t closing the border, the people of Hyder cross into Stewart for a Canada Day parade. Three days later, the people of Stewart head in the opposite direction for the Fourth of July. (Festivities include the “Bush Woman Classic,” an obstacle course of sorts in which female contestants must chop wood, flip a flapjack, diaper a baby doll and then apply lipstick while running 20 yards to the finish line.)\\n\\nPresident Barack Obama pointed to the bond between the towns as evidence of the close ties between Canada and the United States during Trudeau’s state visit in 2016.\\n\\nNow, each Hyder household may send one member on a three-hour visit to Stewart for essentials every seven days. Residents of Stewart may enter Hyder because there’s no U.S. immigration control, but must quarantine for 14 days upon their return. Miners who enter Hyder to work are exempt because the activity is considered essential.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSupport for a travel bubble is widespread. Stewart Mayor Gina McKay said she worries about her Hyder neighbors, and whether they’ll be able to adequately prepare for winter and months more of isolation.\\n\\n“In March, nobody ever thought that come September, we’d still be in this situation,” McKay said.\\n\\nWes Loe, the unofficial mayor of Hyder, said tensions are rising.\\n\\n“If they decide not to create a bubble community, they’re doing a lot of mental damage to the people,” he said. “There’s always people making all these decisions for us that have never even been here.”\\n\\nSeveral U.S. lawmakers, including Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), have indicated support. Bonnie Henry, British Columbia’s top doctor, said the request sounded “reasonable,” but the final decision rests with the federal government. Officials have been noncommittal.\\n\\nBlair told reporters this week he understands the restrictions have had “significant impacts,” including on families and international students. He said the government was looking at whether it could establish a process to allow people to apply for exemptions, so Canada could “show compassion” without compromising “the security and safety and health of Canadians.”\\n\\nThe struggles are familiar to other communities on the border. Jessie Hettinga lives in Point Roberts, an American outpost at the southernmost point of British Columbia’s Delta peninsula.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPoint Roberts has reported no covid-19 cases, but its residents have been largely marooned since the border closed, and its economy has suffered without the Canadians who frequent its restaurants and fill up on cheap gas.\\n\\nHettinga learned last month that students who cross the border daily to attend school in British Columbia would no longer be exempted from the 14-day quarantine, as they were when schools there reopened briefly in June. They wouldn’t be able to live at home and commute to school.\\n\\nPoint Roberts Primary School — “Home of the Borderites” — goes only to Grade 3. Hettinga’s 17-year-old son attends school in Blaine, Wash., two border crossings away; her 15-year-old daughter, a gymnast, and 13-year-old son, a hockey player, go to school in British Columbia and train there.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“My initial reaction was heartbreak,” she said. “Our whole world just got turned upside down.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHettinga moved to Point Roberts from Bellingham, Wash., five years ago in part so her children could immerse themselves in Canadian culture. Now her family is split: Two of her children are living with families in British Columbia for the school year.\\n\\n“The thing that makes me most upset about the situation is that ‘essential’ is not always consistent,” Hettinga said. “You have workers coming in and out of Point Roberts … and work is considered essential; however, education is not …\\n\\n“Education is vital for these children.”\\n\\nIn their letter to Blair, Reps. Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.) and Collin C. Peterson (D-Minn.) said that “inconsistent interpretation of the guidance” had prevented some constituents from crossing for essential purposes such as medical appointments.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHenry J. Chang, a Toronto-based immigration lawyer at the international law firm Dentons, said what constitutes non-discretionary travel is not spelled out in “black and white” in the restrictions, leaving much up to the discretion of border agents.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“The rules are more defined than they were six months ago,” he said. “There is a lot of improvement. Is it perfect? No.”\\n\\nHyder’s K-12 school closed in May because of low enrollment. When the Korpelas registered Hilma and Ellie in Stewart, they say, they were assured that they would have no difficulty crossing the border for school.\\n\\nNow they support the push to get the region declared an integrated trans-border community. A spokesman for Canada’s public health agency said the Indigenous territory of Akwesasne, which spreads across Quebec, Ontario and New York, is the only place with that designation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJackie Korpela, the girls’ mother, is planning to work part time to home-school the girls.

Unlike in Europe and the United States, where immigration debates generally revolve around undocumented or low-wage labor, middle-income professionals are the source of anxiety here.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA lawmaker with the ruling People\\'s Action Party recently spoke of visiting a business park with a high concentration of expatriates and feeling \"like a foreigner in my own country.\" This month, the government began raising minimum salaries that professionals must earn to qualify for a visa. It is urging companies to lay off non-Singaporeans first; the trade minister has said the country of 5.7 million welcomes skilled talent but is \"making a move toward quality, rather than quantity.\"\\n\\nWealthy Singapore has a white-collar workforce of about 1.7 million — about 400,000 of whom hold foreign visas. It is unclear whether the policy changes are a reaction to pandemic-induced economic trouble or reflect a deeper inward shift.\\n\\nSingapore\\'s success has been built on its reputation as a country where doing business is easy and immigration laws are relatively liberal. Some companies warned that forcing them to pay higher salaries will increase costs, but for now, many are waiting to see how the situation evolves post-pandemic.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\"Demand for work permits has come down to a trickle,\" said Gagan Sabharwal, a senior director at Nasscom, an Indian tech industry trade group.\\n\\n\"Globally, all countries are putting the local population first,\" said Faiz Modak, a senior manager at Robert Walters, a recruitment firm, adding that Singapore\\'s tightening of visa eligibility would have a minimal effect on many financial-sector jobs.\\n\\nA perceived concentration of Indian nationals in well-paying tech and banking jobs has been especially controversial. Although some European expats have also expressed concerns about rising nativism, attention has been focused on a 2005 agreement between Singapore and India that includes language about movement of professional workers. Singapore\\'s government and recruiters say the accord does not give Indian nationals special privileges.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nData on the national origin of expats isn\\'t publicly available, but Singapore\\'s financial regulator said that 57 percent of senior managers in the industry are foreigners and that the numbers reflect a sector that draws from talent globally and creates good jobs locally.\\n\\nThe perceived number of Indians in finance \"is particularly sensitive to Singaporeans who want to work in those jobs,\" said Sudhir Thomas Vadaketh, a sociopolitical commentator who has been critical of what he calls Singapore\\'s \"growth at all costs\" policies. He added that many countries would face a larger backlash if their middle-class populations had similarly high concentrations of expatriates.\\n\\nUnlike the United States, Singapore doesn\\'t have a visa quota for employees it considers highly skilled.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRacism is undoubtedly a factor behind some of the nativism. About 49 percent of ethnic Indians in 2019 said they faced discrimination in the housing rental market, according to a YouGov poll. The proportion of Singaporeans who said they were comfortable with the idea of having India-born naturalized citizens as a majority in the country dropped from 51 percent to 44 percent between 2013 and 2018, according to a study by the National University of Singapore.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNonetheless, race-based violence is almost nonexistent, and outright xenophobic politicians have been repeatedly rejected at the polls. Instead, much of the discontent stems from professionals who have benefited from globalization and acknowledge the need for foreigners to fill certain jobs.\\n\\nSeveral Singaporean bankers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from their employers, described working in departments in which Indian nationals, not all of whom they thought were qualified, formed a plurality. The government says that since 2016, it has scrutinized more than 1,200 employers suspected of misusing visas.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDBS, a regional bank in which Singapore owns a large stake, was criticized by an opposition lawmaker in Parliament for not having a \"homegrown\" leader. (Its chief executive is a naturalized citizen of Indian origin.)\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\"We are committed to growing our own timber, and to ensure that we have a strong pipeline of local talent,\" said a bank spokesperson, adding that its entire Singapore leadership team was local.\\n\\nThe coronavirus pandemic has dealt a further blow to Indian expatriates. Abhishek Gautam, a 30-year-old mechanical engineer, was in Delhi in March when borders were closed. He said that his applications to reenter Singapore, where he has lived for five years, have been denied more than 25 times and that he has been on unpaid leave since. His visa requires him to be physically present by October, and he isn\\'t sure whether he\\'ll get an extension.\\n\\n\"Work is great, the quality of life is good, and I\\'m really keen to come back,\" he said.\\n\\nMany Indians in similar situations have petitioned their country\\'s leaders on Twitter to intervene. Some comments have been met with derogatory replies from other users telling them to stay home and avoid bringing the novel coronavirus to Singapore. Most of Singapore\\'s recent imported cases of the virus originated in India, and many of its more than 57,000 infections were among South Asian migrant laborers who lived in dormitories.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n\"Entry approvals for incoming travelers . . . are limited to reduce further risk of importation of covid-19 cases and to protect public health,\" said a spokesperson for Singapore\\'s labor ministry.\\n\\nSome resentment also persists from a sense that some Indian nationals treat the country as a steppingstone. \"Singapore is a motel of the global highway, a transit hub,\" said Xavier Augustin, a consultant based in Hyderabad who helps Indian professionals immigrate. The typical Indian professional \"goes to Singapore for a while, gets experience and moves on,\" he said.\\n\\nAlthough globe-trotting professionals are a fixture of global metropolises, Singapore\\'s government faces the challenge of also managing a sovereign state that makes demands such as military conscription for male citizens.\\n\\nAD'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/philippines-deports-us-marine-pardoned-for-murdering-transgender-woman/2020/09/13/8300e39a-f332-11ea-8025-5d3489768ac8_story.html', 'Full Text': 'Pemberton’s lawyer said the Marine had “spent much time contemplating the many errors in his ways” and extended his sympathies to the Laude family. “He wishes he had the words to express the depth of his sorrow and regret,” lawyer Rowena Flores said.

While other convicts are confined to the country’s notoriously overcrowded prisons, Pemberton served his sentence in a cell in the Philippine military headquarters. The arrangement was made possible by the bilateral Visiting Forces Agreement, which governs procedures involving U.S. military personnel in the country.\\n\\nPemberton met Laude at a bar in Olongapo City, north of Manila, in October 2014 after the Marines arrived for joint military exercises. She was later found dead in a motel room, her head over the toilet. Local media reported that Pemberton, then 19, admitted to choking Laude, 26, after discovering she was transgender. He claimed he acted in self-defense, but police determined his actions were a hate crime. He was charged with murder and convicted of homicide in 2015.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the past month, Pemberton’s lawyers sought his early release for good conduct in detention. The Laude family and the Philippine Department of Justice were set to contest the request.

They chanted “Justice for Jennifer!” and “Pardon for Pemberton, a betrayal to the nation!” and displayed posters showing Pemberton and Laude with her head dunked in a toilet.\\n\\n“I’ve had a good cry … but today is for fighting,” said Naomi Fontanos, executive director of Gender and Development Advocates Filipinas.

Duterte, who has shifted his foreign policy away from the West and toward China, said he would terminate the Visiting Forces Agreement, but that plan was suspended in June.\\n\\nFontanos said Duterte’s anti-American rhetoric was “all for show” and “a ruse.”\\n\\n“We’ll continue our fight. The road will be long, we know it,” she said. “I hope this will be a wake-up call for how treacherous this president is.”\\n\\nDuterte’s own cabinet officials were surprised by the pardon.

It would be cheaper yet somehow also more generous than Obamacare. It would be “so easy,” even though “nobody knew health care could be so complicated.” It would “take care of everybody,” even as it took literal care away from many.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis plan was always “two weeks” away — coincidentally the timeline promised for most every Trump announcement, including those about wiretapping, infrastructure and Melania Trump’s immigration history.\\n\\nAs the fortnights passed, suspense grew. Finally, an announcement came this week: This Godot-like plan, this girlfriend-who-lives-in-Canada of public policies — it exists!\\n\\n“I have it all ready,” Trump said at a town hall Tuesday, “and it’s a much better plan for you, and it’s a much better plan.”\\n\\nAlas, Trump remains unable to share this “much better plan” with the public. Or, it seems, anyone within his administration.\\n\\nA day after Trump’s town-hall statement, several senior health officials testifying before the Senate were asked whether they were aware of any specific administration proposal to replace Obamacare.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I’m not involved in the replacement plan,” said Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services. “I don’t know what that is. I supply public health advice as much as I can for whatever that plan would be.”\\n\\nHis colleague Robert Kadlec, assistant secretary for preparedness and response, likewise said the mythical proposal is “not in my portfolio” and “I have no awareness of that.” The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Robert Redfield, echoed that an Obamacare replacement plan is “really not in my main lane, but I’m not aware of one.”\\n\\nNow, it might seem improbable that Trump wouldn’t clue in his most senior health officials about a health-care program they would oversee. But it’s less strange when considering other tasks explicitly in these officials’ portfolios that they also apparently know nothing about.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Thursday, for instance, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said that Redfield’s testimony about when the public would have access to a covid-19 vaccine — a timeline the president had criticized — was wrong.

Never mind that just a day earlier, the CDC had published a playbook for vaccine distribution.\\n\\nAsked who was working on the Obamacare replacement, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany explained that planning involved “a wide array of people.” Also: “I’m not going to give you a readout of what our health-care plan looks like and who’s working on it.”\\n\\nFinally: “If you want to know, come work here at the White House.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn other words, Trump’s brainchild is so sensitive, so secret, it must remain within the cone of silence.

Under Trump’s watch, the uninsured rate was rising even before the pandemic recession, especially among children.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMeanwhile, Trump has asked the Supreme Court to strike down Obamacare, including its protections for those with preexisting conditions.

They are being held incommunicado in Shenzhen after the Chinese coast guard intercepted their speedboat as they were fleeing to Taiwan.\\n\\nHong Kong police in a statement late Saturday said the 12, who have been detained since Aug. 23, are in the custody of the Yantian branch of the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau, which will soon formally arrest them.\\n\\nTheir arrest under Chinese law would mean that the 12 will be absorbed deeper into the mainland’s legal system, which critics describe as politically influenced, opaque, and rife with delays and almost-certain convictions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWith the help of prominent activists in the city, their families are demanding that Hong Kong authorities intervene and seek their return.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I feel like we are doing all we can, but the Hong Kong government is paying no attention to us, and instead playing us over and over again,” said Li’s mother, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her privacy and security and who is part of a support group with families of several of the other detainees. “All I can hope for is a miracle, so that my son can immediately be returned to Hong Kong.”\\n\\n\\n\\nArrested but undeterred\\n\\nLi’s parents were watching live streams of an unauthorized protest on Sept. 29 last year, when they saw officers from an elite police unit burst onto the streets near the legislative council complex and start tackling protesters. In the chaos, they saw their 29-year-old son’s face pressed into the ground, staring at the camera.\\n\\nPolice were particularly aggressive that day as the sensitive 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China was approaching. Riot police fired round after road of tear gas and rubber bullets and doused protesters with stinging blue-dyed water from cannons.\\n\\nLi’s mother rushed to the police station where he was being held and finally saw him some nine hours after his arrest. His shoulders were bruised, she said, and he had wounds all across his back. Li was later brought to a hospital for an assessment and held there until he was granted bail the next day.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLi, who works as a quantity surveyor supervising construction projects, was initially charged with unlawful assembly, but that was later upgraded to the charge of rioting, which carries a 10-year sentence, along with assaulting a police officer.\\n\\nUnder his bail conditions, Li could not return to the area where he was arrested and had to abide by a curfew. So he stopped taking to the streets, his parents said, afraid that the next arrest would land him in jail, without the prospect of bail. He slipped back into familiar routines, going to work as usual and meeting up with friends. But he had grown quieter, they noticed, less willing to vocalize his demands for democracy and justice in his city.\\n\\n“But he never thought of giving up,” his father said. “All he has ever wanted to do was support the protesters and support the movement.”\\n\\n\\n\\n'Unbelievable'\\n\\nOn Aug. 12, after attending yet another pretrial audience in his case, Li had an emotional conversation with his mother about the worst-case scenario and the prospect of spending the next 10 years in prison.\\n\\n“In my eyes, what he did was not at all violent, it was helping people on the front lines,” his mother said, remembering the rolls of gauze, surgical tape, bottles of saline and wound cleaning solution he would pack with him before heading out to protests. “I was hopeful, I thought he was wrong, perhaps he wouldn’t be found guilty or sentenced at all.”\\n\\nSeveral days later, on Aug. 22, Li had dinner with his father as usual. Few words were exchanged before he went to bed. By the time Li’s father woke the next day, about 10 a.m., his son had left the house.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt took a while, though, for his parents — who live apart — to notice anything was amiss. Li had told his father he was spending a few days with his mother.\\n\\nSix days later, Li’s father went to the nearby police station to file a missing person’s report. Soon after he mentioned his son’s name, the officer told him his son had been detained in the mainland. Even when officers showed up at his home with an official notice confirming the detention, his parents still thought it might not be true.\\n\\n“I thought it was unbelievable, why would our son want to escape Hong Kong and flee like that?” his mother said.\\n\\nThe Hong Kong police, in their Saturday statement, said Li and the others had left on a speedboat at 7 a.m. from a small fishing village on the Clear Water Bay peninsula. The boat entered mainland waters just half an hour later.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“They planned to flee to Taiwan via mainland marine waters in order to evade criminal responsibility in Hong Kong,” the statement said. Police are also searching for those in Hong Kong that helped organize their departure.\\n\\n'Mummy is proud of you'\\n\\nWithin a week, Li’s parents and the other families secured human rights lawyers in mainland China, but their legal representatives have still not been granted access to the detainees.

His comments were echoed by the city chief executive, Carrie Lam, who in a news conference said the 12 have “absconded” and “run away from their legal liabilities, and in doing so “committed another crime in another jurisdiction.\\n\\n“Isn’t it reasonable and fair that these 12 people should first face their legal liabilities in that other jurisdiction according to the law? And thereafter we will arrange for them to come back to face consequences,” she said.\\n\\nTheir words have left Li’s parents feeling bitterly disappointed in their government. Lam and the rest should fight for Hong Kong people, they said — and not simply serve as mouthpieces for the mainland authorities.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn her desperation, Li’s mother penned a letter to her son and sent it to immigration officials hoping that it will somehow reach him in detention.\\n\\n“It’s Mummy, how are you? Mummy misses you so much! When will you come back? Every day since you left I’ve suffered from insomnia. Sometimes I have to scream,” the letter reads. “Please come back soon. I can’t lose you.”\\n\\n“Since you were small I didn’t have to worry about you, your character was always so selfless and loving. Sometimes I thought you should be more selfish,” she wrote. “You said Hong Kong is already lost, that Hong Kong is over.

A year ago, he traded his office in the company’s San Francisco headquarters for this tropical home office 2,000 miles away, surrounded by stand-up paddle boards and a monitor large enough to see his entire 25-person engineering team all at once.\\n\\nAndryeyev’s remote office represents a sweeping experiment in the future of work: allowing white-collar workers to work from anywhere, forever.\\n\\nCorporate America has long been defined by physical offices. But in a few short weeks, the pandemic upended that as thousands of companies mandated that their employees work from home. What many thought would be a temporary workaround is now a mass experiment with no end in sight, as many companies await a vaccine or other developments to ensure workers’ safety.\\n\\nWhile many companies are anxious about the new reality, fearful of reopening and worried about the loss of workplace connection, some employers have embraced it — even going so far as making remote work permanent. Outdoor apparel company REI, Facebook and Ottawa-based Shopify have all announced some measures making work from home the new norm.\\n\\nTwitter, the first major U.S. company to make a public announcement in May about its permanent work-from-home plans, has a big head start in identifying the pitfalls and advantages of work from home.\\n\\nFor the last two years, Twitter has been quietly dismantling its office culture, making changes that resulted in blessing employees like Andryeyev who asked to relocate — whether it was Hawaii, rural Ireland or back home in a cheaper state. However complicated, the official policy on employee relocation requests was “get to yes.” The effort began with an off-the-cuff email in 2018 by chief executive Jack Dorsey in which he encouraged employees to work from home after a productive day doing so himself.\\n\\n[Twitter employees don’t ever have to go back to the office (unless they want to)]\\n\\nTwitter has been experimenting with building ways to better support Dorsey’s vision ever since, sending people in the same building to different rooms to test out virtual meetings, creating sign language systems and other rules for video conference etiquette, and preparing for a future when the company anticipates half of its employees will permanently work from home. (Prior to the pandemic, it was only 3 percent.)\\n\\n“We’ve already been on this path, and the crisis just catapulted us into a future state,” said Twitter human resources chief Jennifer Christie, who said she believes flexibility for workers is the “fourth industrial revolution\" because it will fundamentally change the way people work. “The future of work is offering employees more optionality.”\\n\\nThe company\\'s San Francisco offices, empty in May.

BOTTOM LEFT: Empty seats in Twitter\\'s San Francisco offices. BOTTOM RIGHT: A deserted desk at the San Francisco building.\\n\\nTwitter’s decision to allow its 5,200 primarily San Francisco-based employees to decide where they want to work has major implications for everything from its real estate and salaries to workplace culture writ large. The company could potentially usher in a new model for attracting and retaining talent based on worker-centric values of flexibility, autonomy and satisfaction.\\n\\nJust this month, the company said it was subleasing three floors of its art deco office building in San Francisco. (The company says it plans to keep all its real estate worldwide and two of the three floors were already subleased.)\\n\\nBut the decisions led by Twitter and followed by other companies could just as soon herald the end of an era when great ideas at work were born out of daily in-person interactions — a hallmark of Silicon Valley thinking. Apple founder Steve Jobs described it as the creativity that comes from serendipitous run-ins with colleagues, telling his biographer that “creativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random discussions.” The ideas for Facebook and Google were generated in a college dorm room and a garage near Stanford University, while Dorsey has said he came up with the idea for the short-form micro-blogging service while hanging out with his co-founders in San Francisco’s South Park.\\n\\nThe result could be less innovative, more checked-out workers and empty tech hubs free of lunch-hour buzz.\\n\\n[Big Tech was first to send workers home. Now it’s in no rush to bring them back.]\\n\\nJust six months after the coronavirus outbreak led thousands of companies to mandate that their employees work from home, 35 percent of the full-time U.S. labor force is still working remotely, compared to 2 percent prior to the pandemic, according to an August survey of 2,500 professionals by Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford University economics professor who specializes in distributed employment.\\n\\nWhile accelerated by the pandemic, Twitter executives in exclusive interviews explained that the company’s shift to distributed work is ultimately about creating a model that gives employees more autonomy and freedom, which they believe improves morale, retention and productivity. The policy, which is now one of four official company goals, also gives Twitter greater ability to hire diverse and more affordable employees from all parts of the country.\\n\\n“Our concentration in San Francisco isn’t serving us anymore,” Dorsey told investors in February.\\n\\nThe company has had its share of challenges. Some Twitter employees are struggling with scheduling across time zones, and executives had to formally cut down on video meetings, which spiked as people went home during the pandemic, to avoid Zoom fatigue, executives and employees said in interviews. They had to rethink their performance review system so it wouldn’t be biased against remote workers when people return to the office. Others said it was harder for employees to log on remotely during a recent major hack of the company’s systems, in which high-profile accounts like former president Barack Obama’s were taken over.\\n\\nThe biggest challenge, Mike Montano, the company’s vice president for engineering, said, is “the need to create space for social connection” that isn’t forced. Montano has been tweeting photos of his home office in San Francisco in hopes of inspiring others. He said you want to re-create “a water cooler effect,” a serendipity that lets people build connections that “aren’t transactional.”\\n\\nHe plans to stay largely remote after the pandemic, coming into the office occasionally and spending longer stretches of time with family outside California.\\n\\n[Facebook will now let some employees work from anywhere, but their paychecks could get cut]\\n\\nTwitter has decided to allow its 5,200 primarily San Francisco-based employees to decide where they want to work.\\n\\nTwo years in the making\\n\\nWhen Twitter chose its current headquarters in 2012, a sprawling Depression-era art deco building that had fallen into disuse, the move was hailed as a victory for San Francisco. The city gave Twitter a 1.5 percent cut off its payroll taxes to move into offices near the Tenderloin, a struggling neighborhood 10 minutes from downtown.\\n\\nAt the opening night party for the new headquarters, Dorsey drank smoothie shots with staff on the rooftop deck overlooking the homeless encampments below. “Gorgeous,” Dorsey tweeted that night.\\n\\nFor the next five years, thousands of Twitter engineers, product managers, designers, lawyers, and human resources professionals would stream into the headquarters each day, enjoying perks like daily catered lunches and corn hole boards.\\n\\nThen in January 2018, Dorsey, who is known as a freewheeling thinker, fired off a late-night email that took everyone by surprise — even the company’s own head of human resources. The email was originally written for his inner circle of senior executives, but he then unexpectedly forwarded it to the whole company. The subject line was “reflection.\"\\n\\n“I decided to work from home today,” he wrote. “I got a lot done, and felt more focused and creative. We should always optimize for where people feel their most creative, and I’d love to see us be a lot more flexible about working from home.”\\n\\nAs long as people were setting the right expectations with their colleagues and getting their work done, it was “all good,” Dorsey wrote.\\n\\nChristie said her jaw dropped when she read the email, which appeared to be announcing a work-from-home policy she wasn’t aware of.\\n\\nShe thought her mission, when she was hired in late 2017, was to improve retention, which was lagging because the social network had yet to become profitable six years after its public offering. At the time, Silicon Valley companies were competing for talent by offering some mix of massive salaries, the promise of contributing to a world-changing start-up and one-upping one another on office perks, like lavender lemonade and latte bars. Twitter had the latte bars, but it no longer had the allure of a start-up and couldn’t offer the salaries of Facebook or Google.\\n\\nTwitter chose its current headquarters, which includes a patio, in 2012.

BOTTOM LEFT: Inside Twitter\\'s vacated San Francisco offices. BOTTOM RIGHT: Inside Twitter\\'s vacated San Francisco offices.\\n\\nChristie said her team was inundated with emails from confused employees asking what Dorsey meant. Because they didn’t quite know, the team began to craft a plan to make working remotely much easier for all Twitter employees.\\n\\nThey surveyed the implications of various employee moves from legal, tax, IT and security, real estate and immigration perspectives. They looked into the tax consequences for workers who wanted to move to countries where Twitter wasn’t authorized to operate. The security team began creating protocols for large numbers of people logging into company systems outside of headquarters.\\n\\nEarly on, the company’s most senior executives realized the tone was going to be set from the top, so they started to model new behavior. In December 2019, Dorsey tweeted his own plans to move to Africa for three to six months in 2020 (though his plans have been set back by the pandemic). Two senior executives, Leslie Berland and Matt Derella, who were hired in New York City, were not asked to move to San Francisco.\\n\\nMontano used 2019 as a virtual experiment. He started working from home one to two days a week, overseeing a team of 2,000 people from his home office in San Francisco. He and other senior leaders also used the year to visit all of Twitter’s 35 offices around the world. He worked from New York last fall.\\n\\n“In order to build a distributed team and decentralized company, I had to build empathy for what it was like not working from what people call ‘the headquarters,’” he said, noting the company is already abandoning the term in favor of “SF Market.”\\n\\nHe explained that in the office, he gets “pulled into the Tetris of meeting after meeting.” Many engineers are introverts like himself who have their best thoughts when they are alone and able to work uninterrupted, he said.\\n\\nTo test out the experience of regular video-conferencing, Montano had team members video-conference via Google Hangouts one another from different rooms inside Twitter’s headquarters.\\n\\nOther teams collaborated on video conference etiquette, coming up with a manual of hand gestures and other protocols that could be used to signal when someone wants to pipe up in a meeting or needs to leave early. One protocol the engineers have established is the “silent read,” in which every meeting starts with people reading a common document and putting their comments into a chat system alongside it. Another is the HR team’s agreement to write the acronym ELMO — “Enough! Let’s move on” — into a chat system when meetings veer off topic.\\n\\nTwitter also established a policy of radical honesty when it came to virtual communication.\\n\\n“Even if it seems like a very tiny thing, like [your colleague’s] chair is squeaking and it’s driving you insane, we want to hear about that. Because if you encounter it a thousands times, it’s going to really wear on you,\" Andryeyev, the engineering manager in Hawaii, said. He moved a few months before the pandemic because he wanted to live in a peaceful place with more socioeconomic diversity.\\n\\nThe foyer of Twitter headquarters in San Francisco.\\n\\nPandemic challenges\\n\\nSince Dorsey’s 2018 announcement, things have also been messy. The WiFi of an employee who moved to rural Ireland conked out during an important presentation, forcing her to answer colleagues’ questions using hand gestures. A manager delivered a harsh performance review without realizing the worker’s spouse was in the background.\\n\\nBut all the preparation meant that when the pandemic came, Twitter was more ready than other companies. It sent a note encouraging employees to work from home March 2, one of the first companies in the United States to do so during the pandemic.\\n\\nOn May 12, Dorsey sent a companywide email, signed with a heart emoji, with the subject line “#lovewhereyouwork.” “We’re serious about a distributed workforce, and we’ve proved we can make it work,” he wrote. “If you’re in a role and situation that enables you to work from home and you want to continue, do so…forever if you want!.\"\\n\\nAcross corporate America, Twitter’s announcement “sent HR departments scrambling,” said Susan Strayer LaMotte, a former Marriott executive and chief executive of Exaqueo, a human resources consulting company. “They are talking to their lawyers, talking to their consultants, asking, ‘Should we do this? Can we do this? How?’ ”\\n\\nSoon after the announcement, Christie’s team had already devised a policy to suspend performance reviews for the year based on feedback from struggling parents. It was also ready to offer financial compensation for child care and $1,000 for home workspace upgrades.\\n\\nThey came up with creative ways to help people socialize remotely during the pandemic, such as virtual cooking demos from colleagues and “story time” with workers’ kids. But many people say building relationships without in-person encounters is still hard, particularly for new employees.\\n\\nThe biggest test of remote functioning was a major hack that hit the company this summer. Hackers who obtained access to internal employee credentials took over the accounts of dozens of celebrities, including Obama and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, and used them to encourage people to buy bitcoin. Twitter employees were automatically signed out of their accounts, and some struggled to get back in to communicate with their colleagues, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on record.\\n\\nThe company says that during the hack, the difference between being in the office and at home was negligible.\\n\\nBut overall, employees say they feel more productive at home, according to the latest company survey in July. Nearly 70 percent of Twitter employees said in the survey that they want to continue working from home at least three days a week. Still, single and younger employees showed a preference for coming back to the office, while parents and older workers said they prefer to work from home.\\n\\nA company survey in July found that nearly 70 percent of Twitter employees wanted to continue working from home at least three days a week. Despite vacating offices, Twitter says it plans to keep all its office space globally for the time being.\\n\\nLEFT: A company survey in July found that nearly 70 percent of Twitter employees wanted to continue working from home at least three days a week. RIGHT: Despite vacating offices, Twitter says it plans to keep all its office space globally for the time being.\\n\\nTwitter insists the decision is not about saving money, and the company says it plans to keep all its office space globally for the time being. But the company will probably save money from hiring outside of San Francisco, which commands some of the highest worker salaries in the United States. Twitter says its wages will be competitive for the localities where they hire.\\n\\nDorsey, meanwhile, is working from his home in San Francisco but has gotten around. He was recently photographed on a boat in the Hamptons with Beyoncé.\\n\\n“Right now, no one is in the office and we’re not missing out,” said an employee who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. “But FOMO starts to happen when people come back to work, and it will be harder to stay out of the office.”\\n\\nChristie said the company’s attrition rate is down double digits since 2017, which she attributes to a variety of factors including overhauled compensation packages, the company’s profitability and, to a lesser degree, its flexible approach to relocation.\\n\\n[The coronavirus has abruptly changed the way we work — and some of those changes may be forever]\\n\\nBut a number of companies, including Yahoo, Bank of America, Aetna, Best Buy and IBM, have tried and ended telecommuting programs and called employees back to the office in recent years, citing lower productivity. Stanford’s Bloom said it was hard to isolate work from home as a cause of lower productivity as opposed to other morale challenges.\\n\\nMatt Mullenweg, chief executive of WordPress’s parent company and a longtime proponent of distributed work, said attrition dropped 20 percent and morale went up for his 1,200 employees after his company abandoned San Francisco and became a “distributed\" firm in 2005.\\n\\nSimon Sinek, author of several books on management, said many people “grossly misunderstand” what he described as Twitter’s “progressive\" approach. “Their policy isn’t working from home. It’s letting people work where they feel most productive,” he said. “They don’t need to ask permission. They don’t need to feel guilty.”\\n\\nFor years, he said, companies, led by Silicon Valley, have been obsessed with superficial perks. But Twitter is doing something that is more meaningful. Instead of perks or other superficial tactics, he said, “You are now competing on satisfaction.”\\n\\nTwitter headquarters in San Francisco.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/23/heres-what-chris-wallace-needs-ask/', 'Full Text': 'Mr. President, have any of your Supreme Court nominees assured that they will vote in your favor?

His father, pushed by poverty, had been the first to leave for the Persian Gulf in search of work.

Such remittances hit a record high of $554 billion in 2019.\\n\\nThis year, however, the World Bank expects remittances to fall by 20 percent, which would be the sharpest decline on record. For some countries, that drop will be a crushing blow. In Nepal, Honduras, Haiti, Lesotho and Tajikistan, for instance, remittances represent more than 20 percent of gross domestic product. Even for a large economy like India, remittances are important: Last year, they outstripped the total amount of foreign direct investment in the country.\\n\\nIn Kerala, the dependence on funds sent from abroad is a not-so-secret element of the state’s developmental success. One in every four households in the state includes a migrant who works abroad, according to a 2018 survey.\\n\\nKerala received about $15 billion in remittances last year, according to Dilip Ratha, the lead economist on migration and remittances at the World Bank. That’s more than a tenth of the state’s entire economic output. As remittances fall, so too will tax revenue, limiting the state government’s ability to help people during what is shaping up to be India’s worst recession in modern history.\\n\\nThe migration route from Kerala to the gulf, built upon centuries of trade with the Middle East, is so well established that is has absorbed successive generations of the same family, like the Athekkatils. Along curving roads in the northern part of the state, one can spot the “gulf houses” — a term for the sometimes comically large residences that well-paid migrants build back home in Kerala.\\n\\nIn normal times, tens of thousands of Keralites return each year, having saved enough money or because they’re ready to come home. After the 1991 Persian Gulf War and the 2008 financial crisis, migrants returned involuntarily, but on a smaller scale than what is unfolding now.\\n\\nThose prior episodes demonstrate how wrenching the return can be, said Irudaya Rajan, a professor at the Center for Development Studies and an expert on migration from Kerala.\\n\\n“They went to make money,” he said, “and now they’ve lost everything.”\\n\\nGone to the gulf\\n\\nThe five Athekkatil brothers pictured with their father Kumaran, far left, and mother Lakshmikutty, far right. Pradeesh, Ramakrishnan, Unnikrishnan, Sethu and Rajesh all followed in their father’s footsteps by leaving southwest India to work in the Persian Gulf. (Ashiq MK for The Washington Post)\\n\\nFor migrants and their families, there were drawbacks well before the pandemic. When the Athekkatil brothers talk about their father, Kumaran, it is with a sense of respect for his sacrifices in the gulf: the extreme heat, the long hours, the loneliness.\\n\\nKumaran left for the UAE in 1983. Unable to read or write, he had colleagues help him write letters. He would return home only once every three years, storing up his leave time so he could stay for two months. The ink pens and scented erasers he brought as gifts were the envy of his sons’ classmates.\\n\\nBut the time with his wife and children was scarce. “He was always crushed that he’d be leaving again soon,” said Unnikrishnan, 49, the eldest of the five brothers. “My father lived for his family, not for himself.”\\n\\nWhen the brothers were small, they lived in a home with mud walls and a roof of thatched leaves, with every month an anxious wait for the arrival of the money from abroad that sustained 10 people in the extended family. Unnikrishnan said he couldn’t stand seeing his father bear the burden alone. He dropped out of school after the 10th grade.\\n\\nIn 1998, he became the first of the brothers to go to the gulf. He took up a job as an assistant at the same company where his father worked, Ghantoot General Mechanical Engineering, in an industrial zone of Dubai. Years before, his father had planted a mango seed from Kerala behind the warehouse. By the time Unnikrishnan arrived, the tree was bearing fruit.\\n\\nOne by one, the four other brothers — Ramakrishnan, Sethu, Rajesh and Pradeesh — all followed.\\n\\n“I told everyone to stay here,” said their mother, Lakshmikutty, a slight woman in a red-and-white printed sari, sitting on her terrace on a recent afternoon. “But everyone wanted to go.”\\n\\nUnnikrishnan, the eldest of the Athekkatil brothers, climbs a mango tree behind the warehouse where he works in Dubai. His father Kumaran planted the seed for the tree after he arrived in the Persian Gulf in the 1980s. (Mohamed Somji for The Washington Post)\\n\\nRamakrishnan was the most enthusiastic, having made up his mind early that he, too, would migrate to the gulf. “To make money, what else would it be?” he said with a laugh. His first job in Dubai was working the overnight shift at a newspaper printing plant, earning $136 a month in today’s dollars.\\n\\nOver the years, Ramakrishnan moved from the printing press to delivering newspapers to collecting revenue for an English-language paper in the UAE. His salary increased to $1,600 a month. By earlier this year, however, it was obvious that business was soft as oil prices plunged and the UAE’s non-oil private sector contracted for the first time in over a decade. Then he began to read in the news about a strange new illness coming from China.\\n\\nWhen the pandemic hit, its impact fell hardest on migrant workers. In Qatar and Saudi Arabia, the virus swept through labor camps and cramped apartments where foreign workers lived, trapped by poverty and lockdowns. Job losses exploded.\\n\\nIn the UAE, for the first time in recent memory, residents saw desperate migrants begging for food or money in the streets.\\n\\nOthers began bartering their possessions for groceries and other necessities on Facebook groups, or waiting in long lines for provisions offered by charities. Some say they are unable to pay for flights home or cannot bear the thought of leaving with little or nothing to give to their families.\\n\\nSethu, 43, the third of the Athekkatil brothers, works as a metal fabricator in Sharjah, one of the seven emirates that make up the UAE. He said he spent several months this spring confined to his shared room in a dormitory with other workers. There was no work and nowhere to go. Pradeesh and his colleagues struggled to make ends meet after their company abruptly stopped paying them.\\n\\nRejimon Kuttappan, a labor activist in Kerala who works with migrants in the gulf, said that starting in March, he began to receive call after call from workers reporting that companies were not paying them the money they were owed as they were laid off. They felt they had no recourse, Kuttappan said, and no option but to leave.\\n\\nThe Burj Khalifa skyscraper stands beyond an empty road among other office buildings in Dubai. The pandemic has forced some migrants to beg for food and money. (Christopher Pike/Bloomberg)\\n\\nFor decades, foreign workers in the gulf have accepted a state of enforced impermanence in exchange for higher salaries than they could earn at home. In the past, it was usually possible for migrants to stay for decades: Many raised families in the gulf, or spent careers there, squirreling away enough money to support a family, or even a clan, at home.\\n\\nWhen jobs opened up, they recruited family and friends from back home to fill them, bringing growth and prosperity, over generations, to companies that would never bear their names.\\n\\nBut the ability to remain in the gulf was never certain.\\n\\n“There is always an element of instability,” said Rima Kalush of Migrants-Rights.org, an advocacy organization. For migrants all over the Persian Gulf, she said, the pandemic has made it “more visceral that it’s not possible to have a future there, unless you are the elite of the elite.”\\n\\nProposals to “indigenize” the labor force in gulf states were hatched decades ago but are getting renewed attention during the pandemic. Last month, Saudi Arabia implemented a plan to reserve 70 percent of certain retail jobs for locals. In Kuwait, lawmakers have threatened to reduce the number of foreigners in the country to just 30 percent of the population, down from the current 70 percent. Experts believe the plan is impracticable and unlikely to materialize.\\n\\nHomecoming\\n\\nLakshmikutty, who goes by one name, watched as her husband and five sons left India one by one in hopes of finding more lucrative work. “I told everyone to stay here. But everyone wanted to go,\" she said. (Ashiq MK for The Washington Post)\\n\\nThe pandemic vaporized the jobs of two of the Athekkatil brothers. The newspaper company where Ramakrishnan had worked since 1999 delayed paying him for three months, he said, and proposed that he take a steep pay cut until the economy improved.\\n\\n“I was ready to do that,” he said.\\n\\nMore than anything, he wanted to keep paying down the loan he took out to build his house in Kerala, a spacious two-story home in a grove of coconut trees close to where he grew up. But on June 10, Ramakrishnan was terminated along with dozens of others, he said.\\n\\nPradeesh, the youngest brother, worked for a company called Al Muttahida Limousine, doing airport pickups and drop-offs for Emirates, Dubai’s state-owned airline. He said he received no salary from April to June, and in May the company asked employees to sign an addendum to their employment contract indicating that they had agreed to go unpaid.\\n\\nPradeesh said the company then asked drivers to agree to go unpaid for an additional three months. He refused. Representatives for Al Muttahida did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nRajesh, 40, the second-youngest brother, had already returned to Kerala last year because of a back injury and because he felt his salary was too low.\\n\\nSethu, the metal fabricator, spent months cooped up while his factory was shut. Work has since restarted, but he sees layoffs happening all around him and worries that some migrants are willing to work for cheaper salaries.\\n\\n“I don’t know what will happen,” Sethu said.\\n\\nOnly Unnikrishnan’s job — as a clerk in GGME’s warehouse — seemed safe, partly because of his father’s legacy at the company. But even he was nervous about the future with business so slow.\\n\\nEach night, he returns to the labor camp where the men sleep five to a room in bunk beds. He sends about $400 home to his family each month, and while he speaks to them every day, he won’t see them in person for another year.\\n\\nRamakrishnan Athekkatil is back home in India with his son Parthip, daughter Pooja and wife Sudha. His position at a newspaper company where he had worked since 1999 was terminated in June. (Ashiq MK for The Washington Post)\\n\\nAfter Ramakrishnan was laid off, he tried, without success, to find a different job. In late June, he boarded a flight sponsored by a television station in Kerala, just one of many private efforts to bring out-of-work migrants home for free. The Indian government also organized a massive airlift. One such flight returning from the gulf to Kerala ended in tragedy when the flight skidded off the runway, killing 20.\\n\\nRamakrishnan landed in the state’s capital, Thiruvananthapuram, then boarded a government bus heading north.

He managed to pay the latest installment on his loan with the final payment from his employer but didn’t know where he would get the money for those that would follow. Even now, his mind is full of thoughts of going back to the gulf — anything to avoid the indignity of returning home with nothing.\\n\\nWhen his father came home from the gulf and retired, he took to selling produce out of a small concrete shack nearby — a way to combat idleness rather than to earn a living. Now Ramakrishnan decided his only option was to reopen it as a tiny store where he could sell vegetables and rice on a quiet rural lane.\\n\\nHis two children are happy to have him home. “They don’t know what loans are, what life is,” he said with a laugh that barely covered the strain he feels. If he had an offer to work again in the gulf, he said, “definitely I would go.”\\n\\nUncertain how he\\'d be able to make the next payment on the loan he took out to build his house, Ramakrishnan Athekkatil decided his only option was to open a tiny store where he would try to sell rice and vegetables.

High Commissioner for Refugees, and Tunisians are now by far the largest nationality arriving in Italy. An average of two migrant boats left the coastal town of Zarzis every evening during the summer bound for the Italian island of Lampedusa, local fishermen said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA 23-year-old house painter from Zarzis said he set out last month with eight other men and five boys, including his younger brother, on a 25-hour voyage across an “agitated” sea. When they arrived in Lampedusa, the “joy was indescribable,” he said in an interview conducted via Facebook.\\n\\nThe young man, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid attracting more attention from Italian authorities, spent a month in offshore detention before being released. Many of his fellow migrants, however, are likely to be deported. Regular deportation flights from Italy to Tunisia resumed last month.\\n\\nOverall, sea arrivals in Italy this year of all nationalities — about 20,000 people as of last month — are far fewer than the hundreds of thousands recorded in 2016 and 2017, the United Nations says. Still, experts say the surge in Tunisian migrants is likely a harbinger of a new wave, as the coronavirus takes a mounting toll on livelihoods in developing countries.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“In the medium term, I think it’s safe to assume that there’s going to be more pressure on the migratory front to Europe,” said Olivia Sundberg Diez, a policy analyst at the European Policy Centre, a think tank in Brussels.\\n\\nAymen Hussein, 25, who works in a Zarzis restaurant, said bad weather in recent days has been the only thing preventing him from trying to make the crossing. His restaurant had closed during the lockdown, and when it reopened, his low wages were not enough to keep up with rising food prices, and he’s struggling to make ends meet, he said.\\n\\nKhouildi Saif, 25, a fisherman in Zarzis, said his peers face a grim choice: “I’ll either die in my country or I’ll die in the sea.” These days, he said, many prefer to risk the sea.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nObtaining visas to Europe is costly and difficult for most Tunisians. For years, they have resorted to dangerous Mediterranean crossings known across North Africa as the “harraga,” or “burning,” as migrants “burn” borders in search of a better life in Europe.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAmid unprecedented border closures in the spring, due to public health restrictions, irregular migration to Europe virtually ground to a halt. But after the restrictions lifted, more than 4,000 Tunisians crossed to Italy in July alone, the United Nations says. Tunisians have made up about two-fifths of all sea arrivals this year, a proportion that migration experts say is unusually large.\\n\\nThe influx has caused alarm in southern Italy and raised diplomatic tensions between Italy and Tunisia. Some Italians on the far right have spread fears that migrants are bringing the coronavirus to the country, despite Italian officials’ statements that irregular migrants account for a small percentage of imported cases.\\n\\nWhen cases were first reported in Tunisia in March, authorities reacted swiftly, closing external borders and most businesses, imposing a strict curfew and barring travel between regions. The measures paid off. By the time its borders reopened in June, Tunisia had recorded only 1,064 cases and 50 deaths.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the restrictions further damaged an economy already afflicted by high unemployment, declining purchasing power and stark inequalities. Most Tunisians are unable to work from home and so were hit especially hard.\\n\\n“These full-on lockdowns have very different effects in developing countries than they do in developed countries, where working from home is easier and more people are formally employed,” said Max Gallien, a research fellow in political economy at the University of Sussex.\\n\\nTourism, vital to the country’s economy, has dried up, with tourism revenue falling 61 percent by August, according to statistics from the Central Bank of Tunisia. At this time last year, French and Russian beachgoers filled the tables of Zarzis, said \\xadSabrine Kilani, who tends bar at the Restaurant Le Dauphin. Eyeing a room of empty seats in the middle of a recent lunch hour, she described this tourist season as “null.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs a result of the coronavirus, the country’s economy is expected to contract by 4.3 percent in 2020, according to International Monetary Fund projections, representing the largest recession since Tunisia gained independence from France in 1956.\\n\\nPolitical instability, meanwhile, has exacerbated the crisis. Prime Minister Elyes Fakhfakh resigned amid corruption allegations in July, leaving Tunisia without a government at a critical time and further denting the public’s confidence.\\n\\nSituated on Tunisia’s southeastern coast and far from coast guard radars, Zarzis has long been on the front lines of irregular migration to Europe. Fishermen here take pride in having saved hundreds of migrants who set sail from Libya and were shipwrecked off Tunisia’s coast.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUNHCR has reported more than 300 people dead or missing in the central Mediterranean this year. Armed with higher-quality GPS devices and knowledge of the seas, Tunisians often fare better than migrants leaving from nearby Libya. Still, Romdhane Ben Amor, communications officer for the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights, estimated that dozens have disappeared at sea this year.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSlah Din Mcharek, president of the Zarzis fishermen’s association, said every boat leaving Zarzis for Italy these days carries one or two young fishermen. “The fishermen, we saved people,” he said. “Now, we make the ‘harraga.’ ”\\n\\nThe young house painter, recently released from detention in Italy, said his life plans had not initially included the hazardous, illegal trip to Europe. After he received his high school diploma, a university in Paris promised him a spot in 2016, he said. But his visa applications were rejected twice.\\n\\nHe wound up painting houses in Zarzis, saving enough to secure a spot on a harraga boat in 2019. The Tunisian coast guard foiled that first attempt. When the pandemic hit and painting houses became impossible, the painter said he felt he had no choice but to try again, as soon as possible. He took out a loan and his mother sold a piece of gold to fund his passage.\\n\\nWhen he and his fellow travelers first reached Lampedusa, they spent 12 days in a reception center filled with migrants of various nationalities, including women and young children. He was then placed in quarantine on a large boat off the Sicilian coast.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMost Tunisians who make the journey to Italy, including the Zarzis painter, hope to end up in France.

The United Nations warned in June that the world is on the brink of its worst food crisis in 50 years.\\n\\n“It’s scary and it’s overwhelming,” Arif Husain, chief economist of the United Nations World Food Program, said in an interview. “I don’t think we have seen anything like this ever.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn China, the two foods in the tightest spots are pork and corn, with the nation’s pigs hit hard by African swine fever and much of the year’s corn crop ruined by floods. But fresh foods of all stripes are in short supply, too, due to the coronavirus pandemic and flooding — from eggs, to seafood, to leafy green vegetables.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBeijing has declared it is not in a food crisis and says it has enough reserve wheat to help feed its people for a year. Still, China’s leadership has watched uneasily as pork prices soared 135 percent in February and floods washed away vegetable crops.\\n\\nAnd for China’s leadership, there is a worrisome legacy. The country has a long history of food shortages sparking political unrest.\\n\\nThe risks for Beijing extend overseas. China is dependent on the United States this year to bridge its corn shortfall, a position it has sought to avoid for years by stockpiling grain. Beijing’s developing-world allies are facing their worst food insecurity in decades.\\n\\n'Clean Plate' push\\n\\nBeijing’s solution has been a sunny “Clean Plate Campaign” launched in August, with the aim of curbing food use without prompting public alarm. Like the American Victory Gardens of World War II, the campaign is as much about trying to unite the country around a patriotic mission in a time of hardship as it is about securing the food supply.\\n\\nRestaurants across the nation are dishing out “half-servings” in line with the drive. Some, such as the upscale Peking duck chain Quanjude, have instructed servers to nag diners not to waste. Other restaurants are fining people for leaving too much on their plates.\\n\\nAt one elementary school in southern China, students must send teachers short videos of their dinner each night to verify they are cleaning their plates, according to the state-run People’s Daily. A number of university canteens are giving away fruit and other small gifts to students who finish their lunches.\\n\\nEven billionaire Jack Ma, founder of the online retail giant Alibaba, has been filmed trying to save food. A recent viral video shows him asking for his unfinished crab and lobster to be boxed up to go.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Pack it up, pack it up, pack it up!” he says in the video. “I will eat it on the plane.”\\n\\nGovernment officials are, of course, forbidden from holding lavish banquets during this period.\\n\\nAs these restrictions took effect, China’s overall inflation on food costs eased to an annualized 8.8 percent in August from 10.2 percent in July, though vegetable inflation ticked back up to double digits with continued heavy rains and flooding. These higher prices are still affordable for China’s growing middle class, but they are being felt keenly by those on lower rungs of the economic ladder.\\n\\nMemories of famine\\n\\nFor Chinese leader Xi Jinping, the food thrift campaign is not solely a practical measure, but also a reflection of Xi’s fundamental “hatred of materialism and wastefulness,” said Joseph Torigian, an assistant professor specializing in Chinese politics at American University.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTorigian cited Xi’s sister, who wrote that their father had been a stickler at conserving food at meals, even though he was a senior official.\\n\\n“We were terrified of his strict rules on thriftiness,” she wrote. “For example, when eating, he never allowed us to drop a single piece of rice or bit of food. If you weren’t careful and you dropped a bit of food, he would immediately pick it up and eat it.”\\n\\nFood security is one of the oldest concerns of the Chinese Communist Party. Millions starved to death in the famine of the late 1950s to early 1960s during Mao Zedong’s rule. Many who survived remember eating tree bark or grass to get through.\\n\\nEarly leaders identified food shortages and economic downturns as possible triggers for public uprisings. The Communist Party’s most severe political crisis to date, the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests, took place in a period of runaway inflation and economic malaise that bred popular discontent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOver the past couple decades, the implicit bargain offered by Chinese leaders has been unprecedented economic advancement and opportunities in exchange for political quiescence. That means the ability for regular folk to eat meat regularly instead of as a luxury, as well as having a range of nutritious foods within reach.\\n\\nWhen Xi assumed office in 2012, one of his flagship policies was to eradicate extreme poverty from China by this year. Local officials across the nation have worked to meet this target for years until the pandemic threw a wrench in these plans.\\n\\nOne of China’s rare private food banks, the Shanghai Green Food Bank, reported in recent weeks that growing numbers of the city’s migrant workers are having trouble making ends meet and are requiring food assistance.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHusain, the World Food Program economist, said an estimated 270 million people globally are suffering acute hunger this year, twice last year’s count.

Tourism is down some 60 percent year-on-year, according to the Ministry of Tourism and Sports.\\n\\nLike elsewhere in Europe, however, virus numbers have begun to creep up. Some European government have put Croatia on lists of countries to which they no longer recommend travel, or require quarantines for returning travelers.\\n\\nOn Saturday, several thousand people gathered in Zagreb to protest coronavirus-related restrictions, such as face mask requirements and limits on public gatherings.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNearby Turkey and Albania have also become popular meetup spots for separated binational couples, because of relatively relaxed visa and entry rules.\\n\\nFrom Croatia, some couples have been able to travel on together to other countries in Europe or the United States, depending on the rules in place at their final destination.\\n\\nEssential relationships\\n\\nBefore the pandemic, the Schengen Area effectively abolished internal borders between member states.

As neither planned to live there, they decided to meet in Croatia instead.\\n\\nEarlier this month, Broekhuizen found herself alone in an Airbnb in Zagreb, after Daavettila’s flight from the United States was canceled.

Some boats have become lost or caught in storms, requiring rescues at sea. Frantic families have had no word from sons and husbands who set off from Lebanon’s rocky coast, leaving relatives to assume the worst. And in the most harrowing cases, the Lebanese have been easy prey for smugglers who take their money and leave them to die.\\n\\nLisheen and dozens of others on his boat drifted for more than a week after a promised rendezvous with a guide boat supposedly filled with provisions never materialized. He watched helplessly as desperation and death overtook his fellow passengers, starting with a toddler who died in his father’s arms.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“They are well aware of the horrible situation in Lebanon right now,” Lisheen said of the smugglers. “People are just desperate, and they are using this to their advantage.”\\n\\nLisheen was back in his Tripoli neighborhood, his face and arms covered with bites and abrasions from three days that he said he spent floating at sea before a U.N. patrol boat picked him up. He had left the boat to swim for help.\\n\\n“Either here or at sea, I am dead,” he said.\\n\\nHardship is nothing new in Lebanon, a country racked by decades of conflict. But even the beleaguered Lebanese are shocked that conditions have become so hopeless that their fellow citizens are joining the treacherous migration across the Mediterranean that is typically associated with refugees from the region’s failed states.\\n\\nLisheen, who said he hasn’t had a job in five years, is part of an unemployment wave that topped 35 percent in the months since the coronavirus pandemic took hold here. Protests over government corruption have rocked the country for more than a year. And Hezbollah, which is both a militant group and political party, has engaged in military exchanges with Israeli forces across the southern border.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Lebanese lira had already lost close to 80 percent of its value when 2,750 tons of improperly stored ammonium nitrate exploded at the Beirut port on Aug. 4, killing at least 200 people, bringing down the government and plunging the country deeper in crisis.\\n\\nThe hopelessness is felt nowhere more than in Tripoli, Lebanon’s second-largest city and a gritty coastal enclave where up to 80 percent of families live in poverty. Those deciding to flee have made the city’s waterfront a new departure point.\\n\\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said a surge in attempts to reach Cyprus began in late August, with at least 18 boats carrying potentially hundreds of people putting to sea from Lebanon. That is one vessel more than all the migrant boats known to have left Lebanon last year, the agency said, and those were filled almost entirely by Syrian refugees.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe agency has stepped up efforts to spread word in Tripoli’s poor communities about the trip’s dangers. And while departures paused after the ill-fated attempt of Lisheen’s group, dubbed the “death boat” in local media, officials do not expect the lull to last.\\n\\n“As we have seen in other countries, it is likely that conditions in Lebanon mean we will see other attempts,” said UNHCR spokeswoman Lisa Abou Khaled.\\n\\nArafat Khalid Yassin, a 25-year-old from Tripoli, has tried twice to cross to Cyprus, most recently at the beginning of this month. One of his friends died in Lisheen’s boat and another is missing. But Yassin is planning to try again; his mother has forbidden him to take his 20-month-old daughter.\\n\\n“It is better to die at sea trying to leave than live a life of poverty and starvation in Lebanon,” he said.\\n\\nSeveral boats have reportedly been stopped by Lebanese or Cypriot naval patrols, with passengers returned before their potential claims for asylum could be heard. One group of migrants that reached Cyprus told reporters they were promised they would be taken on to Italy, only to find themselves returned to a pier outside Beirut.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“We are concerned about reports that a number of boats that have attempted to reach Cyprus have been pushed back to Lebanon and that some new arrivals have been denied access to asylum procedures,” said Shabia Mantoo of the UNHCR’s Geneva headquarters. “We’ve brought our concerns to the Cypriot authorities.”\\n\\nAn official at the Cypriot Embassy in Lebanon referred questions to Cyprus’s Foreign Ministry, which did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nLisheen hadn’t thought much about what might be waiting for him in Cyprus, where Lebanese who’d made it have set up WhatsApp groups to help new arrivals find housing and work. Nor did he know how dangerous the crossing could be when an acquaintance connected him with two Lebanese men who promised to get him on a boat.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe sold his refrigerator, a couch and his dishes to scrape together the 5 million-lira fee (about $3,300 at the official exchange rate or about $675 on the black market) and met several of his neighbors at the docks. It is unclear how many people ultimately crammed aboard the small craft, but Lisheen said he counted 47, half of them Lebanese and half Syrian.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe smugglers collected the passengers’ bags of clothing, food, water and phones and said it would all be carried in a second craft that would meet them a few miles offshore. No second boat ever appeared. For hours, and then days, they drifted without fuel in the searing sun.\\n\\nMohammad Sofian, 21, was aboard with his pregnant wife and 2-year-old son. Without water, his wife was eventually unable to nurse the boy. After agonizing days, they gave him seawater to drink. On the fourth day, he died.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I wrapped him in clothing,” said Sofian, who is now back in Tripoli with his wife. “After a few days, I put him over the side.”\\n\\nAll the while, the smugglers were sending messages to the passengers’ families in Tripoli, assuring them that the trip was going well and sharing Google Earth images purporting to show the boat’s location.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“They were lying to our parents while we were dying at sea,” Sofian said.\\n\\nSeveral men, including the boat operator, went over the side, hoping to swim for help. The boat operator has not been seen since, and it remains unclear whether he was aware of the smugglers’ plans. Lisheen swam and floated for days, stung by jellyfish, bitten by unknown sea creatures. On two occasions, he said, he tried to let himself sink to oblivion, only to find himself floating again.\\n\\nOn Sept. 14, a Turkish frigate patrolling as part of the United Nations’ Lebanese peacekeeping force, UNIFIL, spotted the boat drifting about 23 miles off the Lebanese coast.

National Guard Maj. Adam D. DeMarco told lawmakers that defense officials were searching for crowd-control technology deemed too unpredictable to use in war zones and had authorized the transfer of about 7,000 rounds of ammunition to the D.C. Armory as protests against police use of force and racial injustice roiled Washington.\\n\\nIn sworn testimony, shared this week with The Washington Post, DeMarco provided his account as part of an ongoing investigation into law enforcement and military officers’ use of force against D.C. protesters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn June 1, federal forces pushed protesters from the park across from the White House by blanketing the street with clouds of tear gas, firing stun grenades, setting off smoke bombs and shoving demonstrators with shields and batons, eliciting criticism that the response was extreme. The Trump administration has argued that officers were responding to violent protesters who had been igniting fireworks, setting fires and throwing water bottles and rocks at police.\\n\\nBut DeMarco’s account contradicts the administration’s claims that protesters were violent, that tear gas was never used and that demonstrators were given ample warning to disperse — a legal requirement before police move to clear a crowd. His testimony also offers a glimpse into the equipment and weaponry federal forces had — and that they sought — during the early days of protests that have continued for more than 100 days in the nation’s capital.\\n\\nDeMarco, who provided his account as a whistleblower, was the senior-most D.C. National Guard officer on the ground that day and served as a liaison between the National Guard and U.S. Park Police.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe chaos that erupted on the evening of June 1 played out before millions of viewers on split-screen television broadcasts as President Trump strode through the emptied park toward St. John’s Episcopal Church, where he delivered remarks and posed for photos with a Bible.\\n\\nU.S. Park Police Chief Gregory Monahan has testified that protesters were given clear warnings to disperse via a Long Range Acoustic Device. But DeMarco told lawmakers that is impossible because there was no such device on the scene at the time.\\n\\nJust before noon on June 1, the Defense Department’s top military police officer in the Washington region sent an email to officers in the D.C. National Guard. It asked whether the unit had a Long Range Acoustic Device, also known as an LRAD, or a microwave-like weapon called the Active Denial System, which was designed by the military to make people feel as if their skin is burning when in range of its invisible rays.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCol. Robert Phillips of the Defense Department’s Joint Forces Headquarters-National Capital Region said in a statement Thursday that the officer sent the email — which DeMarco cited in his testimony — “as a matter of due diligence and prudent military planning” to determine what capacity agencies had “across the full spectrum of non-lethal systems.” He said “JFHQ-NCR does not possess these systems, did not request such systems, and no further action was taken” after the email was sent.\\n\\nThe Defense Department, U.S. Army and D.C. National Guard did not respond to specific questions about munitions and their intended use.\\n\\nThe Active Denial System, also called a “heat ray,” was developed to disperse large crowds in the early 2000s but was shelved amid concerns about its effectiveness, its safety and the ethics of using it on human beings.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPentagon officials were reluctant to use the device in Iraq. In late 2018, the New York Times reported, the Trump administration had weighed using the device on migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border — an idea shot down by Kirstjen Nielsen, then the Homeland Security secretary, citing humanitarian concerns.\\n\\nEthical and safety concerns have long shadowed the device. When it first debuted in 2001, Human Rights Watch adviser William M. Arkin wondered how it might affect children or pregnant women who happened to be in a crowd.\\n\\nThe burning effect comes from a gyrotron, which creates heat by pushing energy through a magnetic field, similar to a microwave. The weapon generates millimeter waves meant to penetrate 1/64th of an inch into the skin — enough to hurt without leaving burns. But in a 2007 military test, a change in the device’s power settings resulted in second-degree burns to one airman’s body.\\n\\nThe military spent millions developing and testing the device, zapping thousands of military volunteers.

We wanted to know whether new threats — like the pandemic and climate change — would undermine tolerance and leave cities more divided and dangerous.\\n\\nTo find out, we researched attitudes in one megacity, Lagos, Nigeria. What we found suggests that the answer is yes. As the pandemic has devastated the economy, xenophobic attitudes and social polarization have climbed. We found that members of politically influential ethnic groups — especially those hardest-hit economically by the pandemic — were more likely to express xenophobic attitudes. But while ethnic minorities suffered more seriously from the economic effects of the pandemic lockdown, they were less likely to express hostility to members of other groups.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHere’s how we did our research\\n\\nThrough a locally recruited team of enumerators, we conducted a phone survey in May with 868 market vendors of different ethnic backgrounds from a representative sample of 146 markets around Lagos, one of the world’s largest cities.\\n\\nLagos has an estimated population of more than 20 million, and it attracts migrants of different ethnic backgrounds from across Nigeria. Members of the Yoruba ethnic group are an estimated 60 percent of the city’s population, but are split on religious lines and along region of origin. The non-Yoruba population is divided between Igbo, Hausa and other ethnic groups from Nigeria’s southern Delta region.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe vast majority of Lagosian workers are employed in the informal economy, including mostly small businesses unregulated by the state. Markets are the largest sites of informal economic activity. Like other informal workers, market vendors rely on daily earnings for their livelihood.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe study sample, which we randomly selected from the population of Lagosian vendors during earlier in-person research, gives us a window into the pandemic-related struggles faced by the city’s poorer residents and by similarly vulnerable populations in megacities around the world.\\n\\nOur survey asked questions about individuals’ livelihoods; covid-19’s effects on their businesses and households; what pandemic assistance they’ve received, if any; and possible xenophobic attitudes toward other ethnic groups. To measure social polarization, we asked respondents how willing they might be to share a meal with a person from a different group; how warmly they felt toward their own group and toward others; and whether they saw members of a different group as a serious threat.\\n\\nMost Lagosians suffered losses, but those in the ethnic majority faced less hardship\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMost survey participants suffered losses from the government-imposed March and April lockdowns on movement and economic activity. More than 70 percent reported lost income; 37 percent reported they’d had less access to food than before the lockdowns.\\n\\nYoruba vendors, who were roughly half of our respondents, were 7 percent less likely to report food shortages and 9 percent less likely to report that their shops had been closed than were their ethnic minority peers.\\n\\nYoruba politicians and the bureaucrats they hire dominate state and local politics, which may have protected ordinary Yorubas from pandemic regulations. Most elected officials are Yoruba, even those representing diverse communities, and the city has never had a non-Yoruba governor. State government agencies enforce lockdown regulations, with some assistance from federal police, and state and local government personnel distribute government relief.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYoruba respondents were more likely to keep running their businesses during lockdown. At the same time, they were significantly more likely to have applied for and received government benefits during the crisis, particularly food assistance. This was not because they were poorer than ethnic minority vendors; we found no evidence that pandemic food assistance was targeted to the most vulnerable.\\n\\nAffected majority group members expressed more polarized and xenophobic attitudes\\n\\nYorubas — especially those who can trace their families’ origins to Lagos — expressed more polarized attitudes than members of other groups. For instance, when asked if members of a different group are a “serious threat” to Lagos, 26 percent of Lagosian Yoruba and 14 percent of other Yoruba said yes. Only 7 percent of ethnic minority respondents said the same about other groups.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYoruba vendors who had their shops closed express more polarized and xenophobic attitudes than Yoruba who were less affected by the crisis. We found similar results when we looked at other economic difficulties, such as food insecurity. Among ethnic minorities, we found no such increase in polarized views if they suffered covid-19-related economic hardships.\\n\\nWhat does this mean for pandemic response?\\n\\nLagos politicians and community leaders have not been openly encouraging ethnic divisions. And yet majority-group Lagosians who’ve been hurt by the pandemic still grew more xenophobic.\\n\\nOur findings suggest that ethnic polarization and xenophobia will keep increasing along with the pandemic. Xenophobic attitudes can exacerbate existing inequalities in access to covid-19 information and care, since news about benefits is often filtered through politically connected social networks. Social polarization can additionally increase distrust in the media and government, undermining covid-19 responses.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOur research shows that people belonging to more powerful and privileged identity groups become more hostile to ethnic “outsiders” when faced with hard economic times. Politicians may therefore need to grapple with significant backlash from political “in-groups’” if they want to care for the whole community. In Lagos, had politicians distributed aid and support equitably, xenophobic and polarizing backlash might have been even worse.\\n\\nJessica Gottlieb is associate professor at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University.\\n\\nAdrienne LeBas is associate professor of government at the School of Public Affairs at American University.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-protest-lafayette-square/2020/09/16/ca0174e4-f788-11ea-89e3-4b9efa36dc64_story.html', 'Full Text': 'D.C. National Guard Maj. Adam D. DeMarco told lawmakers that defense officials were searching for crowd-control technology deemed too unpredictable to use in war zones and had authorized the transfer of about 7,000 rounds of ammunition to the D.C. Armory as protests against police use of force and racial injustice roiled Washington.\\n\\nIn sworn testimony, shared this week with The Washington Post, DeMarco provided his account as part of an ongoing investigation into law enforcement and military officers’ use of force against D.C. protesters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn June 1, federal forces pushed protesters from the park across from the White House by blanketing the street with clouds of tear gas, firing stun grenades, setting off smoke bombs and shoving demonstrators with shields and batons, eliciting criticism that the response was extreme. The Trump administration has argued that officers were responding to violent protesters who had been igniting fireworks, setting fires and throwing water bottles and rocks at police.\\n\\nBut DeMarco’s account contradicts the administration’s claims that protesters were violent, that tear gas was never used and that demonstrators were given ample warning to disperse — a legal requirement before police move to clear a crowd. His testimony also offers a glimpse into the equipment and weaponry federal forces had — and that they sought — during the early days of protests that have continued for more than 100 days in the nation’s capital.\\n\\nDeMarco, who provided his account as a whistleblower, was the senior-most D.C. National Guard officer on the ground that day and served as a liaison between the National Guard and U.S. Park Police.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe chaos that erupted on the evening of June 1 played out before millions of viewers on split-screen television broadcasts as President Trump strode through the emptied park toward St. John’s Episcopal Church, where he delivered remarks and posed for photos with a Bible.\\n\\nU.S. Park Police Chief Gregory Monahan has testified that protesters were given clear warnings to disperse via a Long Range Acoustic Device. But DeMarco told lawmakers that is impossible because there was no such device on the scene at the time.\\n\\nJust before noon on June 1, the Defense Department’s top military police officer in the Washington region sent an email to officers in the D.C. National Guard. It asked whether the unit had a Long Range Acoustic Device, also known as an LRAD, or a microwave-like weapon called the Active Denial System, which was designed by the military to make people feel as if their skin is burning when in range of its invisible rays.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCol. Robert Phillips of the Defense Department’s Joint Forces Headquarters-National Capital Region said in a statement Thursday that the officer sent the email — which DeMarco cited in his testimony — “as a matter of due diligence and prudent military planning” to determine what capacity agencies had “across the full spectrum of non-lethal systems.” He said “JFHQ-NCR does not possess these systems, did not request such systems, and no further action was taken” after the email was sent.\\n\\nThe Defense Department, U.S. Army and D.C. National Guard did not respond to specific questions about munitions and their intended use.\\n\\nThe Active Denial System, also called a “heat ray,” was developed to disperse large crowds in the early 2000s but was shelved amid concerns about its effectiveness, its safety and the ethics of using it on human beings.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPentagon officials were reluctant to use the device in Iraq. In late 2018, the New York Times reported, the Trump administration had weighed using the device on migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border — an idea shot down by Kirstjen Nielsen, then the Homeland Security secretary, citing humanitarian concerns.\\n\\nEthical and safety concerns have long shadowed the device. When it first debuted in 2001, Human Rights Watch adviser William M. Arkin wondered how it might affect children or pregnant women who happened to be in a crowd.\\n\\nThe burning effect comes from a gyrotron, which creates heat by pushing energy through a magnetic field, similar to a microwave. The weapon generates millimeter waves meant to penetrate 1/64th of an inch into the skin — enough to hurt without leaving burns. But in a 2007 military test, a change in the device’s power settings resulted in second-degree burns to one airman’s body.\\n\\nThe military spent millions developing and testing the device, zapping thousands of military volunteers. Yet, when the first serious demand came to deploy it in combat during the Iraq War, military leaders demurred.

His decisions, it has become clear, are guided not only by his self-interest (as always), but also by an utter contempt for the public and what they are capable of.\\n\\nThe defense that Trump didn’t want to create a panic is complicated by the fact that he tries to create panic all the time, whether it’s panic that caravans of migrants are about to invade Texas or panic that anarchists are coming to burn down suburban neighborhoods. And it’s clear that the panic Trump most worried about was a panic in financial markets.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut even if we were to take him at his word — after all, a broad public panic over covid-19 couldn’t have been good for his reelection — it reflects no better on him.\\n\\nOn Sunday, Trump held an indoor rally in Henderson, Nev., defying a state order limiting the size of such gatherings. Photos of the event show no social distancing at all among thousands of attendees, and only a few people wearing masks. Trump assured the crowd that there’s nothing to worry about. “We will very easily defeat the China virus,” he said. “That’s what’s happening, and we’re already making that turn. We’re making that round beautiful last turn.”\\n\\nSo not only have Trump and his campaign decided to argue that his response to the pandemic was utterly magnificent; today he argues that it’s all but over. Kids should go back to school, businesses should reopen, and we can pack together in indoor rallies.\\n\\nNow think about this: When caught by the Woodward tapes, he says that back then, when he had knowledge almost no one else did, lying to avoid panic was the appropriate decision. But now everyone knows what he knew then. We know how deadly it is, and that the virus is airborne. The 6.5 million Americans who have been infected could tell you. So what’s the justification for continuing to lie right now?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTo answer that, you have to understand how Trump views the public. If there is anything he’s good at, it’s homing in on people’s darkest impulses and worst motivations. Greed, envy, fear, resentment — these are the things on which he built a business career and then a political campaign. His is the con man’s view of human nature, in which we’re all grasping and immoral, and anyone dumb enough to give their life savings to Trump University got no less than what they deserved.\\n\\nSo when a pandemic loomed, the idea of leveling with the public and calling them to action clearly didn’t occur to him. He could have said, “This virus presents a grave danger, but there are steps we can take to minimize the harm. It will not be easy. It will require a common commitment, of the kind we’ve shown in other times of great trial. But if we all act together, we can prevail.”\\n\\nThat’s what leaders in other countries said to their populations. And in many places, they got the common purpose they sought. To take just one example, in the past week, 30 people in Canada have died from covid-19. When you adjust for population, if Americans were dying at the rate Canadians are dying from covid, that would mean we would have had 262 deaths in the past week. The actual number of Americans who died from covid in the past week is more than 5,500, or more than 20 times as much.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut where we are right now, with nearly 200,000 dead and many more to come, is literally the best that Trump thought we were capable of. When he says he didn’t want people to panic, it’s because he assumed that would be our only response. The idea that we might do the right thing if called upon was simply not a realistic possibility as far as he was concerned.\\n\\nSo he chose for us what he thought would be ignorant bliss: lie to the American people, tell them that everything was fine, and hope that as the bodies piled up they wouldn’t get too mad at the person who’s supposed to handle national crises. And that is the strategy he pursues even to this day.\\n\\nOne can justifiably criticize the rosy picture most politicians paint of the American people, in which we are possessed of limitless wisdom, generosity and determination, nothing less than the finest of all human beings anywhere and at any time. But at least one can say that these regular paeans encourage us to embody those virtues.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump, on the other hand, never calls us to nurture our better selves. He sees us as the basest of creatures, motivated only by hatred of others and the most impulsive reactions to stimuli. The purpose of his leadership is to channel our ugliness in the direction most beneficial to him, whatever that may be at a given moment.\\n\\nThe wreckage is all around us. With seven weeks until the election, Trump insists not only that this was the best he could do, but also that it was the best America could do. What will it say if the voters decide he’s right?'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/24/jk-rowling-controversy-transgender-harry-potter-author-statements-women/', 'Full Text': 'Although Rowling is no stranger to Internet controversy, this issue is a serious departure from hijinks at a fancy magic boarding school. For some time, Rowling’s online activity seemed to court left-leaning followers. She tweeted lefty political views and criticized conservatives. She even tried to make the Potter series more diverse after the fact, suggesting one character is gay and another might be Black. But more recent activity, including messages she favorited and her own tweets, sparked scrutiny of Rowling’s views on transgender people. And a long statement Rowling posted in June about her views on “sex and gender issues” stoked, rather than dispelled, tensions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn this and and some other recent controversies, partisans have squared off over movies and novels before they’ve been able to see or read them. This is a good reminder for going back to basics: Direct engagement — whether with inflammatory art or art by people with contentious views — would lead to smarter and more honest arguments about our culture.\\n\\nConsider, for example, the moral panic over “Cuties,” a movie about an 11-year-old Senegalese girl’s coming of age in Paris that was decried as child pornography. In fact, the movie condemns the sexualization of children. But that point has been largely lost in online hysteria, much of it from people who refuse to see the film.\\n\\nThis month the Telegraph published a pre-publication review of the latest detective novel by Rowling (writing as Robert Galbraith), “Troubled Blood,” that said the book’s moral seems to be “never trust a man in a dress.” Given that Rowling has suggested that some men may legally change their gender to prey on women, outrage followed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRead “Troubled Blood,” however, and you’ll learn that a serial-killer character who wears women’s clothes to disarm his victims is neither transgender nor a cross-dresser. Mostly, he’s a red herring. (Rowling’s novel “The Silkworm” was also condemned as transphobic on the basis of a single scene, though its plot actually hinges on an act of vicious anti-trans bigotry by the villain.)\\n\\nWhy this impulse to mischaracterize? Anyone who wants to condemn Rowling as anti-transgender has plenty of material from her manifesto, in which she says the movement for trans equality is “offering cover to predators like few before it.”\\n\\nMischaracterizing Rowling’s fiction or “Cuties” to build a case against them is the quickest way for opponents of these works to discredit themselves. Far better to lean into the dissonance between what an artist says in their work and what they say outside of it — to spot the inconsistencies in their arguments and to strengthen your own.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRowling’s most famous works, the Harry Potter books, preach broad tolerance. Yet the same woman who sympathizes with fictional werewolves struggles to extend the same charity to people undergoing real-world transformations. She also argues in those novels that fear is morally compromising and courage is an antidote to bigotry. In her June manifesto, Rowling acknowledged that personal experiences with domestic and sexual violence inform her views on gender identity. It’s tragic to think that the person who invented Harry Potter has had her own experience of the world so deformed by fear.\\n\\nThe reflex to dismiss instead of to explore is one of the more unfortunate aspects of many current cultural debates. If Rowling’s views on gender identity place her outside the bounds of polite — or at least liberal — society, the thinking goes that consuming her work becomes a suspect act. There might be an affirmative obligation not to buy her novels, or to see the forthcoming “Fantastic Beast” movies, because doing so would be to give her money, attention and respectability.\\n\\nBut boycotting Rowling’s new work or denying you ever liked Harry Potter doesn’t negate her power to persuade and entertain. And it’s far smarter and more strategic to dig into works by an author you consider both influential and dangerous to understand what makes them effective.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis year Jeanine Cummins’s novel “American Dirt” became the subject of wide-ranging complaints, targeting the author’s race, her moral authority to write about violence against migrants and even her manicure. Critics felt that the book shouldn’t be popular, but it was. “American Dirt” spent months on the New York Times bestseller list. Popularity doesn’t make a work good, but the persistent sales suggest there’s something in the book that appeals to American readers — and that might be worth examining.\\n\\nEven Rowling’s most disappointed critics might take away this lesson from the Harry Potter books if they revisit them. Denying Voldemort’s return didn’t do a darn thing to help the Ministry of Magic. The only way to defeat evil and ugliness is to find out where they come from and to face the nature of their power. Disavow Rowling’s views if you disagree. But don’t give up the model she created for how to fight back against them.\\n\\nRead more:\\n\\nAD'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/pope-franciss-new-encyclical-is-a-papal-warning-about-a-world-going-backward/2020/10/04/c3f89b24-026c-11eb-b92e-029676f9ebec_story.html', 'Full Text': 'Amid all that, the pope says, the notion of a kinder, more respecting world “sounds like madness.”\\n\\nBut with the release Sunday of his third encyclical, a book-length paper that feels like something from a bygone time, Francis makes an uncynical case for how people can reverse course. The document amounts to a papal stand against tribalism, xenophobia, and the dangers of the social media age. It also marks a test for Francis in the eighth year of his papacy, at a time when his message has become familiar, and is often overshadowed by the louder voices he warns about.\\n\\nThe coronavirus has put a near-halt to the public events that had become Francis’s hallmark. The pope began writing the encyclical, called “Fratelli Tutti,” or “Brothers All,” before the pandemic. But he argues that the world’s response to the crisis shows the depth of humanity’s mistrust and fractures.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“For all our hyper-connectivity, we witnessed a fragmentation that made it more difficult to resolve problems that affect us all,” he writes.\\n\\nFor Americans, certain passages will likely read as a warning against Trump-style politics. Those sentiments come as little surprise to anybody who has listened to the pope’s remarks over the years — with frequent denunciations of populism and wall-building — but the paper argues in more details about how the style can exacerbate divisions and lead to other societal breakdowns.\\n\\n“Things that until a few years ago could not be said by anyone without risking the loss of universal respect can now be said with impunity, and in the crudest of terms, even by some political figures,” Francis writes.\\n\\nHe adds that there are “huge economic interests” operating in the digital world, capable of manipulation and subverting “the democratic process.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“The way many platforms work often ends up favoring encounters between persons who think alike, shielding them from debate,” Francis writes. “These closed circuits facilitate the spread of fake news and false information, fomenting prejudice and hate.”\\n\\nFrancis’s prescriptions range from the policy-based to the spiritual. He describes steps he says countries should take to more adeptly integrate migrants. He says businesses should direct themselves to eliminate poverty, “especially through the creation of diversified work opportunities.” He says people born into privilege must remember that others — the poor, the disabled — need a “proactive state” more than they do.\\n\\nOther ideas are more fundamental, and deal with listening to the points of view of others.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Other cultures are not ‘enemies’ from which we need to protect ourselves, but differing reflections of the inexhaustible richness of human life,” Francis writes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe includes a critique of consumerism, “empty individualism,” and the free market. Even the right to private property, he says, should be secondary to the common good.\\n\\n“This is a legacy document,” said Monsignor Kevin Irwin, a research professor at the Catholic University of America in Washington, who wrote an introduction to the English edition of the encyclical. “I think this pope is a big-picture guy and he wants to make sure that this is perceived to be the Catholic Church at its best, being welcoming and inviting.” The document is not just for Catholics, Francis says, but for all people of “good will.”\\n\\nThe pope’s previous encyclical, Laudato Si’, addressed responsibility for the environment, climate change and development. His first, Lumen fidei — The Light of Faith — released in 2013, months after he became pope, was written mostly by Benedict XVI, with only a few changes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“[Fratelli Tutti] surely is the most political encyclical,” said Monsignor Domenico Pompili, the bishop of Rieti and head of the Italian bishops’ commission for culture and social communication. “One of its clearest critiques is against politics as a sort of marketing with shortsighted goals. It’s aiming to medium-to-long goals, politics as a vision.”\\n\\nIn the lead-up to Laudato Si’ in 2015, the church held a splashy multimedia rollout in a Vatican hall for journalists and other church officials. This time, the process was far more subdued. Francis traveled on Saturday to Assisi, the Italian hill town that is the birthplace of St. Francis, to sign the document at the saint’s tomb. Only a few dozen people were allowed to attend. The pope, who was not seen wearing a mask, traveled to Assisi by car. It was his first trip outside of Rome since the start of the pandemic.\\n\\nEven before the coronavirus, Francis no longer attracted the fanfare seen in the early years of his papacy. Abuse scandals have bruised his reputation, and there is less novelty about his reform plans for the church. But the pandemic has added to the challenge, keeping the pope mostly confined inside the city-state, where in March he groused that he felt “caged.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFrancis’s year has had some indelible moments — especially a solitary ceremony he held in a rain-soaked St. Peter’s Square — but the virus has denied the pontiff many of his reliable paths for outreach. The Vatican has put on hold all of Francis’s overseas trips, and with it, the news conferences he typically holds aboard the papal plane. In 2019, Francis visited 11 countries and spent a month on the road, often in places on the Catholic periphery that he thought had been overlooked for too long.\\n\\n“Removed from the people, he’s like a fish out of water,” said one Vatican official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share his frank comments on the pope. “Basically, Pope Francis is still in that cage to this day.”\\n\\nAusten Ivereigh, a Francis biographer, said it’s clear the pope had planned to release this encyclical before the pandemic, and it is not his response to the year’s tumult.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“But one might say that the covid crisis has made his message more urgent and relevant,” Ivereigh said. He noted that Francis makes reference to the virus in several passages. “In journalism, we’d say it is pegged to the crisis rather than a response to it.”\\n\\nFrancis does not touch on any of Catholicism’s touchiest issues, such as roles for women and LGBT members inside the church, and though he talks generally about forms of abuse, he does not mention the sex crimes committed by Catholic clerics against minors. Thomas Reese, a Jesuit priest and senior analyst at the Religion News Service, wrote that the paper “is not a quick read that can be used for partisan bickering.”\\n\\nReese noted that many elements of the paper will be familiar to those who have followed Francis’s papacy closely, and the pope widely incorporates material from past speeches and homilies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/09/26/coronavirus-pandemic-global-abortion-access-reproductive-health/', 'Full Text': 'This spring, Socorristas en Red’s more than 500 members shifted to working virtually: By phone and online, they advised women about medical abortions and connected them with doctors who would help. Between March and June, they helped more than 6,000 women navigate the abortion process, nearly half as many as in all of 2019.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAcross the globe, the pandemic has made it harder for women and girls to access reproductive services, as clinics close and barriers to medical care rise. The United Nations warned that millions of unintended pregnancies could result, with some 47 million women potentially cut off from modern contraception.\\n\\nSome programs and policies have succeeded in thwarting this trend, such as Britain’s expansion of telemedicine for self-managed abortions. Global groups like Women on Web provide virtual consultations and help deliver abortion pills to homes, a way to bypass local restrictions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut as the pandemic grinds on, the U.N. predictions echo the reality of millions of women in countries without legalized services or plans in place to cope with prolonged disruptions in reproductive care.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHere’s a look at six key developments:\\n\\nArgentina:\\n\\nArgentine law permits abortion only in cases of rape or threats to a mother’s life. The law allows doctors to opt out on religious or other grounds. In practice, even women who legally qualify are often denied access.\\n\\nIn 2018, Argentina’s lower house passed a bill to legalize abortion during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. The Senate narrowly rejected it. But by then, public opinion had shifted. President Alberto Fernández pledged to legalize abortion when the legislature resumed in March, despite the Catholic Church’s opposition.\\n\\nThen the novel coronavirus came. Congress went virtual. The bill lay in limbo.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome politicians argued that the country’s health-care system was too overwhelmed by the virus to take on abortion procedures. Mariela Belski, the executive director of Amnesty International-Argentina, disagreed.\\n\\n“The excuse of the government saying that the health system is overcrowded is not enough to justify not debating the abortion [law],” she said. “Abortions are for sure going on outside the system in not safe conditions.” Legalizing it, she argued, would put “less pressure on the health system.”\\n\\nColombia:\\n\\nColombia was also on the cusp of change at the start of March, as the country awaited a Constitutional Court ruling on whether to legalize abortions during the first 16 weeks of pregnancy. On March 3, the court ruled not to change the law, which permits abortions within limited periods for pregnancies that result from rape, that pose a risk to the mother’s life or involve a fetus with serious health problems.\\n\\nIn the following months, the coronavirus made it harder for millions of Colombians to access reproductive services, said Catalina Martinez Coral, the regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean for the Center for Reproductive Rights.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs in Argentina, Colombia’s Health Ministry issued guidelines saying abortions were essential services. But many doctors still refused to administer them, a particular problem for isolated women in poor and rural communities. About half of Colombia’s 50 million people lack Internet access, complicating telemedicine, Coral said.\\n\\nSo in mid-September, a coalition led by Causa Justa Movement, a community organizing group, filed a lawsuit against Colombia’s top court. The case argued that classifying abortion as a crime “violates the fundamental rights of women and health personnel.”\\n\\nThe pandemic provided an opening, Coral said.\\n\\n“Precisely because we are living this pandemic and the pandemic is exacerbating access to essential health services, we need to ensure access now,” she said.\\n\\nEngland, Wales and Scotland:\\n\\nBefore the pandemic, women in England, Wales and Scotland could visit a clinic for a consultation and for medically induced abortions, there or at home. Under emergency legislation in late March, in force for the next two years, the same service can now be provided entirely online. No ultrasound is needed in most cases, and pills are sent to homes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Great Britain completely transformed its service,” said Abigail Aiken, an associate professor of public affairs at the University of Texas at Austin who has studied demand for self-managed abortions in the United States and Europe during the pandemic. “The outcomes of these abortions tend to be very good, in terms of, yes, they work and, yes, they are safe.”\\n\\nAiken’s research analyzed demand for Women on Web’s services in eight European countries: Five countries saw significant increases, while England was the only country where requests decreased. She attributed this to women having their needs met through the formal health-care network.\\n\\n“If the outcomes of these abortions are just as good as the medical model we had before, why not make this the status quo?” she said.\\n\\nNorthern Ireland:\\n\\nIn Northern Ireland, the coronavirus was a “quirk in the system” that served as the final push for implementing services, said Dawn Purvis of Alliance for Choice, an abortion advocacy group there.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLast year, the British Parliament ruled that Northern Ireland’s highly restrictive abortion laws contravened Britain’s human rights obligations. By March 31, it said, Northern Ireland’s devolved government had to make abortion services available. Before that, those seeking one were forced to travel to elsewhere in the United Kingdom.\\n\\nThe rollout was rocky. Abortion remains contentious in Northern Ireland, and the conservative Democratic Unionist Party strongly opposes the procedure. Activists accused the health minister of stalling implementation, leading to a brief period when women had to travel by ferry to England for abortions after airlines cut services. By mid-April, medical professionals offered abortions as required.\\n\\nStill, Purvis said she worries about “the most vulnerable women” — like those who are poor, migrants or caught in abusive relationships.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“The coronavirus restrictions have enabled some, but disabled many, many others,” she said.\\n\\nPoland:\\n\\nPoland has one of Europe’s most restrictive abortion laws, which Parliament discussed tightening in April. A similar proposal met with mass protests in 2016. This time, women similarly took to the streets — but in violation of coronavirus-related restrictions.\\n\\nAround Europe, access has not been even. While some countries declared abortions an essential procedure, others, such as Romania and Croatia, did not. In Italy, Human Rights Watch accused the government in June of failing to ensure time-sensitive reproductive care.\\n\\nThe United States:\\n\\nAs The Washington Post has reported, some U.S. states have tried to ban abortions by classifying them as elective medical procedures that were stopped as part of coronavirus emergency orders.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/colombia-police-protest-javier-ordonez/2020/10/05/c8f2df86-0438-11eb-897d-3a6201d6643f_story.html', 'Full Text': \"Video of their initial interaction, shared widely on social media, shows Javier Ordóñez begging “please, no more” as officers repeatedly shocked him with a stun gun. He died later of head injuries allegedly inflicted while in police custody.\\n\\nMedina’s son, Kevin, was returning home from a soccer game in their working-class neighborhood of the capital when he became caught up in a demonstration against the killing of Ordóñez. Police shot him in the arm, she said, during what activists have denounced as excessive force deployed against demonstrators. The bullet, she said, is still lodged there.\\n\\n“I thought the police were good, there to protect, to help with problems … but now I see them as just another problem,” Medina, 37, said. “I have no feeling of security or trust in them anymore.”\\n\\nThe Colombian National Police, which reports directly to the Ministry of Defense, have long stood accused of excessive force, particularly during the half-century civil war that ended in 2016 against the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Ordóñez’s death, and the official response to it, is sparking a far larger national debate over police violence.\\n\\nThousands of protesters took to the streets of Bogotá in the aftermath of Ordóñez’s death last month, leading to clashes with security forces that left 13 people dead and more than 400 injured.\\n\\nBut instead of fizzling out, as protests here have tended to do, the incident has fueled a continuing string of demonstrations and social media agitation. Union members, student groups and human rights activists are now putting police brutality at the top of their list of grievances ahead of a national strike called for Oct. 21.\\n\\nAuthorities have blamed the violence of the demonstrations in part on FARC dissidents and urban militants from the Marxist National Liberation Army, or ELN — a claim protesters say is overstated.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe outcry is further polarizing a country that, like the United States, is deeply divided between law-and-order conservatives and socially conscious progressives.\\n\\n“With my head held high I tell them, they lost,” one young conservative activist tweeted under the trending hashtag #IzquierdaRespeteLaPolicía — “Leftist, respect the police.” “There are more of us good guys and we support our police force!”\\n\\nThe movement here has drawn comparisons to the defund-the-police and Black Lives Matter campaigns in the United States — albeit in a Colombian context. Activists decried the May death of a 24-year-old Afro-Colombian man at the hands of a police officer for allegedly violating a coronavirus curfew. Yet the debate here is pivoting not around race, but on heavy-handed police tactics more generally, especially in interactions with poor and marginalized Colombians and leftists.\\n\\nThe view of the political left is colored by allegations that the conservative administration of President Iván Duque has effectively ignored a surge in killings of human rights activists and community leaders in the countryside while backtracking on fulfilling the requirements of the peace accords struck with the FARC.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“There have always been protests in and outside of Bogotá,” said Gimena Sánchez-Garzoli, Andes director of the Washington Office on Latin America. “When we started seeing them really upping was after the wave of protests last year in countries like Chile. Now, this focus on the police is being influenced by the rise up in the United States. But for them, it’s Colombian Lives Matter. It’s not a racial thing.”\\n\\nThe Bogotá-based human rights group Temblores has documented 40,481 cases of physical violence, 639 homicides and 241 cases of sexual abuse committed by the police since 2017. But the Ordóñez case struck a national nerve.\\n\\nA middle-aged taxi driver who was in the final stages of finishing a law degree, Ordóñez was involved in an altercation with the officers for allegedly drinking on the street in the early hours of Sept. 9, in violation of the country’s strict coronavirus lockdown. After being restrained and Tasered repeatedly for several minutes, he was taken to the nearby Villa Luz police precinct, near Bogotá’s airport. He died that afternoon. Preliminary forensic examinations revealed he had received a significant blow to the head, causing nine skull fractures.\\n\\nHis death, and the video of the initial altercation, sparked outrage beyond the typical student groups and the left.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“We have noticed there is more citizen participation and more people becoming fed up over what they’re seeing in respect to the police,” said Franklin Castañeda, director of the Committee in Solidarity with Political Prisoners, which sends teams of lawyers to protests to aid and protect demonstrators.\\n\\nThe most enraged citizens hit the streets in emotion-fueled and spontaneous demonstrations that quickly turned violent. The police precinct where Ordóñez was killed was quickly rushed and set ablaze.\\n\\n“I was happy to see that people were expressing their anger and that they took to the streets,” said 19-year-old law student Laura Paez, who took part in the demonstrations. “But at the same time I was scared, because when you go out on the street to protest in this country, you don’t know if you’re going to return home.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAuthorities fired live rounds. Protesters responded by throwing rocks and vandalizing dozens of police stations. Three female protesters filed complaints saying they had been sexually assaulted in police custody.\\n\\nSome demonstrators targeted public transportation, to the dismay of many. The initial spasm of violence lasted two days and spread to other cities, including Medellín, Pereira and Ibagué.\\n\\nDefense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo issued an apology two days after Ordóñez’s death. In a statement to The Washington Post, the ministry said it has moved to adopt new measures aimed at strengthening police training on human rights, transparency and engagement with the public.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut government officials also maintain that the violence wasn’t a spontaneous response. Days after Ordóñez’s death, Duque said the ELN and FARC dissidents had infiltrated the protests. Then an ELN leader posted a video on social media confirming that its militants had attacked police precincts.\\n\\nHuman rights groups say claims of ELN involvement are being exaggerated.\\n\\n“What happened in Bogotá wasn’t organized by any type of guerrilla group,” said Jenny Alejandra Romero, Bogotá coordinator of Defender la Libertad, a network of human rights organizations against illegal use of force. “They may have participated, but they didn’t organize it.”\\n\\nThe ELN has continued to carry out attacks on police infrastructure nationwide, mostly in rural areas. The government blamed the group for the killings of two police officers in Colombia’s Bolívar Department in mid-September.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nColombia’s left has condemned Duque for visiting police stations in a bright yellow officer’s uniform while families were burying young victims killed in the protests.\\n\\nGovernment officials say his administration also reached out to victims’ families.\\n\\n“President Duque's pledge is to have a strengthened police force, providing protection and security to those who take part in peaceful marches, but also to protect the rest of the population from vandals and those who want to destroy the city,” Duque spokesman Diego Molano said.\\n\\nHuman rights groups argue the incident has set up a tipping point, one that could ignite a long-lasting movement.\\n\\n“People are going to start demonstrating in a more organized way, and the issue of police violence is going to be at the forefront of the demonstrations,” says Alejandro Lanz, of Temblores.\"}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/09/19/rbg-ruth-bader-ginsburg-holocaust-jewish/', 'Full Text': 'I had the good fortune to be a Jew born and raised in the U.S.A. My father left Odessa bound for the New World in 1909, at age 13; my mother was first in her large family to be born here, in 1903, just a few months after her parents and older siblings landed in New York. What is the difference between a bookkeeper in New York’s garment district and a Supreme Court Justice? Just one generation, my mother’s life and mine bear witness. Where else but America could that happen?\\n\\nMy heritage as a Jew and my occupation as a judge fit together symmetrically. The demand for justice runs through the entirety of Jewish history and Jewish tradition. I take pride in and draw strength from my heritage, as signs in my chambers attest: a large silver mezuzah on my door post, [a] gift from the Shulamith School for Girls in Brooklyn; on three walls, in artists’ renditions of Hebrew letters, the command from Deuteronomy: “Zedek, zedek, tirdof” — “Justice, justice shall you pursue.” Those words are ever-present reminders of what judges must do that they “may thrive.”\\n\\nBut today, here in the Capitol, the lawmaking heart of our nation, in close proximity to the Supreme Court, we remember in sorrow that Hitler’s Europe, his Holocaust kingdom, was not lawless. Indeed, it was a kingdom full of laws, laws deployed by highly educated people — teachers, lawyers, and judges — to facilitate oppression, slavery and mass murder. We convene to say “Never again,” not only to Western history’s most unjust regime, but also to a world in which good men and women, abroad and even in the U.S.A., witnessed or knew of the Holocaust kingdom’s crimes against humanity, and let them happen.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe world’s failure to stop the atrocities of the Third Reich was perhaps nowhere more apparent than in Hungary, where the Holocaust descended late in the war. But when it came, it advanced with brutal speed. Hungary was the first country in Europe to adopt an anti-Jewish law after World War I, a short-lived measure that restricted the admission of Jews to institutions of higher learning. In the main, however, that nation’s 800,000 Jews lived free from terror until 1944. Although 63,000 Hungarian Jews lost their lives before the German occupation — most of them during forced service, under dreadful conditions, in labor battalions — Hungary’s leaders staved off German demands to carry out the Final Solution until March 19, 1944, when Hitler’s troops occupied the country.\\n\\nThen, overnight, everything changed. Within three and a half months of the occupation, 437,000 Hungarian Jews were deported. Four trains a day, each transporting up to 3,000 people packed together like freight, left Hungary for Auschwitz, where most of the passengers were methodically murdered. This horrendous time is chronicled unforgettably by Hungarian Holocaust survivors and Nobel Prize winners Elie Wiesel, today’s lead speaker, and Imre Kertész, in their captivating works, “Night” and “Fateless.”\\n\\nWhat happened to Hungary’s Jews is a tragedy beyond reckoning. For, unlike earlier deportations, the deportations in Hungary began and relentlessly continued after the tide had turned against the Axis, and after the Nazis’ crimes against humanity had been exposed. Less than a week after the German occupation of Hungary, President Roosevelt delivered a speech reporting that “the wholesale systematic murder of the Jews of Europe goes on unabated every hour” and that Hungarian Jews were now among those “threatened with annihilation.” Yet, the world, for the most part, did not rise up to stop the killing.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI say for the most part because, as swiftly as the Hungarian Holocaust happened, heroes emerged. Raoul Wallenberg, a member of Sweden’s most prominent banking family, arrived in Budapest in July 1944, and worked with the War Refugee Board — established by President Roosevelt just six months earlier — to protect tens of thousands of Jews from deportation. Wallenberg distributed Swedish protective passports; he purchased or leased buildings, draped them with Swedish flags as diplomatically immune territory, and used them as safe havens for Jews. Through these devices, he was directly responsible for saving 20,000 people. Wallenberg carried food and medical supplies to Jews on forced marches from Budapest to Austria; he sometimes succeeded in removing Jews from the marches by insisting they were protected Swedish citizens. He has been credited with saving some 100,000 Jews in the Budapest ghetto by forestalling attacks on that population by Hungary’s anti-Semitic Arrow Cross party. In January 1945, Wallenberg met with Soviet officials to gain relief for the Budapest Jews. He did not return from that journey.\\n\\nWallenberg and the War Refugee Board are perhaps the best-known rescuers of Jews trapped in the Hungarian Holocaust. In fact, many others, Jews and Gentiles alike, also rose to the occasion. Some remain unknown for their individual deeds of heroism; others, including Carl Lutz of Switzerland, saved Jews on a larger scale. All the life savers were grand humans. But most of the world stood by in silence. Knowing what a few courageous souls accomplished in Hungary in short time, one can but ask: How many could have been saved throughout Europe had legions of others, both individuals and nations, the United States among them, intervened earlier?\\n\\nI was fortunate to be a child, a Jewish child, safely in America during the Holocaust. Our nation learned from Hitler’s racism and, in time, embarked on a mission to end law-sanctioned discrimination in our own country. In the aftermath of World War II, in the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, in the burgeoning Women’s Rights movement of the 1970s, “We the People” expanded to include all of humankind, to embrace all the people of this great nation. Our motto, E Pluribus Unum, of many one, signals our appreciation that we are the richer for the religious, ethnic, and racial diversity of our citizens.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI am proud to live in a country where Jews are not afraid to say who we are, the second country after Israel to have set aside a day each year, this day, to remember the Holocaust, to learn of and from that era of inhumanity, to renew our efforts to repair the world’s tears. I feel the more secure because this capital city includes a museum dedicated to educating the world, so that all may know, through proof beyond doubt, that the unimaginable in fact happened.\\n\\nIt is fitting, I hope you agree, as I conclude these remarks, to recite another line from Deuteronomy: U’vacharta b’chaim. It means: Choose life. As did the survivors who somehow managed to stay alive, to carry on, and to tell their stories; as did Jews and Christians, in ghettos and in camps, who gave their lives endeavoring to save the lives of others; as did Budapest itself, where the city’s Great Synagogue still opens its doors, the second largest synagogue in the world, the shul in which Theodore Herzl was bar mitzvahed, a structure so impressive visitors from my home state might recognize it as the model for Central Synagogue in New York City.\\n\\nWe gather here today, little more than a week after Passover, the holiday when Jews recount their journey from slavery to freedom. We retell the Passover, just as we commemorate the Holocaust, to educate our children, to remember those who died striving for a better world, and to rejoice in the resistance of the Jewish people to evil fortune, armed with the courage and faith that has enabled them to survive through centuries of exiles, plunderings, and persecutions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Passover story we retell is replete with miracles. But unlike our ancestors in their Exodus from Egypt, our way is unlikely to be advanced by miraculous occurrences. In striving to drain dry the waters of prejudice and oppression, we must rely on measures of our own creation — upon the wisdom of our laws and the decency of our institutions, upon our reasoning minds and our feeling hearts. And as a constant spark to carry on, upon our vivid memories of the evils we wish to banish from our world. In our long struggle for a more just world, our memories are among our most powerful resources.\\n\\nMay the memory of those who perished remain vibrant to all who dwell in this fair land, people of every color and creed. May that memory strengthen our resolve to aid those at home and abroad who suffer from injustice born of ignorance and intolerance, to combat crimes that stem from racism and prejudice, and to remain ever engaged in the quest for democracy and respect for the human dignity of all the world’s people.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/28/new-survey-yes-americans-will-give-up-liberties-fight-coronavirus/', 'Full Text': 'President Trump has endorsed their calls for reopening, accusing Democrats, the news media and state officials of exaggerating the coronavirus’s risks. Recently, Attorney General William P. Barr echoed shutdown protesters by comparing stay-at-home orders to slavery, calling them the “greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history.”\\n\\nThe loudest voices always draw attention. But do shutdown protests represent the beliefs of the American people? To answer this question, we surveyed more than 12,000 Americans, asking whether the government should have the power to enact policies that restrict rights and freedoms to protect public health during the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nHere’s how we did our research\\n\\nOur Web-based survey was distributed by Qualtrics nationwide from Aug. 7 to Sept. 7. Quotas based on race, gender, age and census statistical division, matched to 2018 Census estimates, were put in place to ensure a demographically and geographically representative sample. Respondents were presented with either/or policy choices that explicitly emphasized public health and civil rights trade-offs, giving us a window into public opinion about what sacrifices are appropriate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSpecifically, we asked whether the government should be able to:\\n\\n· Require people to wear masks in public — or not, out of respect for personal freedom\\n\\n· Close nonessential businesses — or not, out of respect for economic freedom\\n\\n· Require people to cooperate with contact tracers — or not, out of respect for the right to privacy\\n\\n· Require people to stay at home — or not, out of respect for freedom of movement\\n\\n· Restrict religious gatherings — or not, because of religious freedom\\n\\n· Restrict public demonstrations — or not, because of freedom of speech and assembly\\n\\n· Suspend asylum and refugee admissions — or not, protecting human rights\\n\\n· Use cellphone data to track the movement of people who test positive for the coronavirus — or not, given a right to privacy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRespondents overwhelmingly and consistently agreed the government should be able to place restrictions and requirements on businesses and people to protect public health.\\n\\nThe overwhelming majority of Americans support restrictions\\n\\nAs you can see in the figure below, 69.4 percent to 78.3 percent of our respondents support the government’s right to implement six of the eight proposed policies. Only 60 percent support policies designed to restrict asylum and refugee programs. The majority (58.3 percent) rejected only one proposed policy: using cellphone data to track infected people, a method primarily deployed in other countries.\\n\\nWhat kind of people support these public health policies?\\n\\nWe used our survey data to disentangle the individual characteristics associated with policy support. Although there are probably a multitude of factors, our preliminary analyses found three key factors. Support comes from people who perceive the virus is a significant threat, who believe it will continue to be so and who are Democrats rather than Republicans.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPeople who say the virus doesn’t pose much of a threat during their daily lives and those who strongly believe the United States has “seen the worst of the virus” are only lukewarm supporters of the policies. On average, these two groups support roughly 41.8 percent and 53.2 percent of the policies, respectively. But for those who think the virus is a big threat and for those who think the worst is yet to come, those figures are 80.3 percent and 77.2 percent, respectively.\\n\\nNot surprisingly, individuals’ party affiliations affect which policies they support. On average, Democrats support 74.2 percent of the listed policies; Republicans support 61.5 percent; Libertarians support 52.1 percent; independents, 68 percent; and those affiliated with other parties, 61.3 percent. However, as you can see in the figure below, whether respondents approve of President Trump’s job performance moderates the effect of party affiliation for Republicans, Democrats, independents and libertarians. Across party lines, those critical of the president are more likely to favor limits on rights and freedoms to protect public health. Accordingly, Republicans critical of Trump are more supportive of restrictive policies than Democrats who approve of his performance. In other words, Trump support trumps partisanship.\\n\\nWhat are the ramifications?\\n\\nAll this suggests Americans are more willing to trade off rights and freedoms to protect public health than the protests might suggest. The public, on aggregate, is highly concerned about the pandemic and willing to sacrifice to contain it. By 4 to 1, Americans believe mask mandates are legitimate. Officials grappling with when and how to reopen may face vocal constituencies that loudly criticize government overreach. But our survey suggests the quiet majority supports the government in imposing public health requirements during the pandemic, even if it curtails some of their liberties.\\n\\nRebecca Sanders is an associate professor of political science at the University of Cincinnati.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2020/09/15/southern-baptist-name-great-commission-baptist/', 'Full Text': \"“Our Lord Jesus was not a White Southerner but a brown-skinned Middle Eastern refugee,” said Greear, who this summer used the phrase “Black lives matter” in a presidential address and announced that he would retire a historic gavel named for an enslaver. “Every week we gather to worship a savior who died for the whole world, not one part of it.

He said 20 percent of churches in the convention are led by pastors of color, and 63 percent of churches that were “planted,” or launched, last year were led by people of color.\\n\\nWhile theology hasn’t changed, he said, what does need to change is the culture of the convention: “We as Baptists want to be defined by 2025, not by 1845.”\\n\\nA long time coming\\n\\nSouthern Baptists debated changing their name for decades, but church leaders concluded that legally doing so would be too expensive for their huge network of churches, seminaries, colleges and other institutions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA recommendation allowing Southern Baptist institutions to call themselves “Great Commission Baptists” was narrowly approved by the convention in 2012, but most leaders chose not to do so.\\n\\nMarshal Ausberry, president of the convention’s National African American Fellowship, said all 13 pastors on his board were in favor of adopting “Great Commission Baptists.”\\n\\n“You’ll have skeptics, with people who say, ‘You’re only doing it because you’re trying to whitewash history,' ” said Ausberry, pastor of Antioch Baptist Church in Fairfax Station, Va., and first vice president of the convention. “But it’s a good time to do it. There’s a sincerity.”\\n\\nMarshall Blalock, the White pastor of South Carolina’s First Baptist Charleston, which is believed to be one of the earliest Baptist churches in the South, said he decided to adopt the name “Great Commission Baptist” after he met with Black pastors in Mobile, Ala., in July in an effort to build bridges.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I would say, ‘I’m Southern Baptist,’ and they’d look at me like, ‘I think I could like you, but I’m not sure,’ ” Blalock said. He said he didn’t realize before that meeting just how many Black Christians outside Baptist circles associate the name with the support of slavery and racial segregation.\\n\\nBlalock and others are wary of being perceived as part of a broader politically liberal movement, or taking actions that could be seen as aligned with the Black Lives Matter movement or the Democratic Party. Still, Blalock said, he thinks using a different name is the best way for the convention to move forward from its past.\\n\\n“Anybody who knows why we’re trying to do this knows we’re not trying to be woke, and we’re not trying to cover up the past,” Blalock said. “We need to remove barriers.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBlalock was on the 2012 convention committee that proposed adding “Great Commission Baptist” as a DBA, short for “doing business as,” which allows organizations to legally do business using a particular name without having to create a new entity. The committee’s report focused on geography and did not discuss whether the “Southern Baptist” name draws a connection to the convention’s historic support for slavery and segregation.\\n\\nHow 'Southern Baptists’ started\\n\\nAt its inaugural meeting in Augusta, Ga., in 1845, the convention considered naming itself the “Southern and South Western Baptist Convention,” according to Nathan Finn, a Southern Baptist historian who is provost of North Greenville University in South Carolina. Southern Baptists disagreed with Northern believers over several issues, but the final straw was whether missionaries could be enslavers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Northern Baptists, now formally called the American Baptist Churches USA, started calling themselves the “American Baptist Convention” in 1950, which caused resentment and provoked competition among Southern Baptists, Finn said. That denomination is now viewed as more liberal in its theology and culture.\\n\\nFinn said he was ambivalent about using a different name for years until this summer, when he jumped on board. “I’m not embarrassed to be a Southerner,” he said. “It’s about what that word conjures up for people, especially people of color. They’re saying: ‘That name is a hang-up. When my people hear that name, they think slavery.’ God forbid we keep a name that evokes that.”\\n\\nIn 1995, the convention issued a formal apology for its complicity in slavery and racism. Gary Frost, a Black pastor who is director of missions for the Steel Valley Baptist Association in Ohio, stood on the stage of the convention and accepted the apology. Frost said he has no problem identifying as a Southern Baptist now, but he also thinks the convention is changing. More people of color have positions of leadership than 25 years ago.\\n\\n“We’re not holding on to symbols of the past. That’s painful for some people. That’s part of their heritage,” he said. “When you learn that it’s hurtful and hurt the spread of the gospel, you have to be willing to let go of them.”\\n\\nJohn Onwuchekwa, an Atlanta-based pastor, left the convention this summer, disgusted by the heavy support for Trump among Southern Baptists. He said changing the name forces the convention to talk about why it identified as “Southern” in the first place.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It was never about geography,” he said. “The convention was one bad marketing meeting away from being the ‘Confederate Baptist Convention.’ ”\\n\\nBut Jemar Tisby, author of “The Color of Compromise: The Truth About the American Church’s Complicity in Racism,” said using a different name could be seen as duplicitous or misleading. “I don’t know the denomination as a whole has done a good job of teaching its sordid history,” he said. “Changing the name now might make that even harder.”\\n\\nJerry Vines, a retired pastor and past president of the convention, said he is “an old-school guy” and wants to be explicit about his Baptist identity. “I do like truth in advertising,” said Vines, who led the First Baptist Church of Jacksonville, Fla. “I like upfront to let people who you are. Not, once you get someone in, you slip it to them.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome Baptists say they couldn’t care less about the name, including Robert Jeffress, pastor of the historic First Baptist Church in Dallas. Many churches have already dropped the name Baptist entirely, including megachurches like Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church in California and David Platt’s McLean Bible Church in Virginia.\"}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/09/12/washington-football-team-has-new-name-stink-remains/', 'Full Text': 'Year after year, it’s a low-talent roster that often talks big.\\n\\nBut this year takes the cake. This is the worst bunch I have seen in burgundy and gold since my youth, when the 1959-61 teams went 5-30-3 and were outscored by 514 points. That’s an unbelievable 13.5 points a game in a league built for parity.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBetween 1961 and last season, no Washington Football Team had a season when it was outscored by more than 10 points a game. But in 2019, Washington was outscored by 169 points — 10.6 a game — the worst showing in 58 years.\\n\\nSince then, the organization has gotten more messed up, subtracted talent, come under fire from all angles and, can you believe it, even had bad luck, hiring respected coach Ron Rivera, who is now fighting a “very treatable and curable” cancer, according to the team — a squamous cell carcinoma located in a lymph node.\\n\\nAs far as the long-term franchise future goes, remember that respected coaches come here, at high prices, to work for Snyder yet somehow still lose some of that shine, for example Joe Gibbs (30-34) and Mike Shanahan (24-40).\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTo understand the present and anticipate the future, it is useful to consider how long it has been since a WFT coach could escape — even in part — the FedEx Swamp. In the four years of Gibbs II, the team was outscored by only four points. In retrospect, that seems like divine intervention.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSince then, Jim Zorn was outscored by 101 points in two years and Shanahan by a devastating 250 points in a four-season reverse “rebuild” that took the talent level backward. Most recently, jolly, nebulous Jay Gruden was outscored by 317 points in five seasons plus five winless games last fall. Fun, right?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nFranchise destruction on this scale can last almost forever. The team then called the Redskins was an NFL sinkhole for 23 years, from 1946 through 1968. The modern team didn’t implode until Gibbs left after the 2007 season. Sorry, but this nightmare may last a long time.\\n\\nAs bad as the 3-13 WFT was last year, it has since subtracted its top three running backs (Adrian Peterson, Chris Thompson and Derrius Guice) as well as two of its top four wide receivers. Yes, four of the top seven in yards from scrimmage will be replaced by rookies and journeymen, none of whom has left more than a ripple in the NFL the past three years.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDefensive starters Josh Norman and Montae Nicholson are gone, too, though perhaps little missed. The one player Washington most wanted back — seven-time Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams — hated the franchise so much he refused to return.\\n\\nThe Team With No Name added the No. 2 pick in the draft, edge rusher Chase Young, who has seldom been able to practice this summer, never a dream scenario. He will help the one unit that didn’t need help: the D-line. Oh, those sly rascals running the WFT.\\n\\nBeyond that, this is an ideal roster to illustrate how you replace players who are inadequate with others who are just a bit worse. Oh, they’re NFL players. Just not very good ones. They may win three or four games, but is there any future in them?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe WFT’s only proven tight end is Logan Thomas, who has proved he’s no answer: At 29, he has eight starts in the past six seasons and caught 16 balls last year. Well, one was a score. Journeyman wide receiver Dontrelle Inman, 31, caught 12 passes last year. Both these gentlemen may be starting pass catchers.\\n\\nIronic as it may seem, the WFT no longer has its more efficient quarterback from last year. Case Keenum and his 91.3 quarterback rating are gone, while, quite logically, the starting job from Day 1 will go to first-round pick Dwayne Haskins, whose rating was 76.1.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCut Haskins 10,000 miles of slack. Surrounded by such “skill players” and O-line protectors, many a brave man would hide in the Orange Lot — although, with no fans, he would stick out.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRivera praises his unknown running backs, saying that in some ways they remind him of his versatile superstar Christian McCaffrey on the Carolina Panthers. Let’s hope for the best. So far, the similarity is all of them have two eyes, two ears and a nose.\\n\\nMuch is expected from compact J.D. McKissic, who has four starts, 88 carries and one rushing score in four years in the NFL. How ever did the WFT wrest him away from the competition?\\n\\nI confess to curiosity about rookies Antonio Gibson (fast) from Memphis and Antonio Gandy-Golden (big) from Liberty. Sooner or later, the WFT has to find a jewel in the third or fourth round of the draft, right? The offensive line will depend on the “continued development” of two such picks: Wes Martin and Geron Christian.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSo this WFT team is going back to its roots: those hideous teams of 1949 to 1963. Why focus on point differential, on the actual score of games? Because it tells you about basic talent levels, especially over multiyear periods, and about general franchise morale — including which teams (Washington) tend to quit when they get behind.\\n\\nThis miserable era is just like 1949-63, except in the past 12 years the WFT has been outscored even worse — by 759 points, better only than the Jacksonville Jaguars, Oakland Raiders and Cleveland Browns.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGood work, guys. All those years, I have enjoyed listening from six feet away as waves of players explained how hard they were trying, how talented they were, how close they were to being good or even very good.\\n\\n“They really believe this,” I would think. And because talent really is so evenly spread and so many NFL games are last-possession close, the WFT would win some games.\\n\\nBut it’s just a disguise. Since Darrell Green retired after the 2002 season, perhaps only four Hall of Famers have worn the “maroon and black”: Champ Bailey, Bruce Smith and Jason Taylor spent their best years elsewhere, and in-his-dotage Peterson was released last week.\\n\\nAdd all this up, and where do I stand?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI will be pulling, not very hard but with an amused smile, for this miserable team every time it plays this year. The existence of a person such as Snyder isn’t its fault. The diligent Rivera deserves a break so that, as he tries to cope with cancer, he doesn’t exhaust himself with coach-conscience worry. The Labors of Haskins will make Hercules look like a slacker. Two other promising products, wide receiver Terry McLaurin and Young, would make fun stars.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThey say it’s always darkest just before the dawn. Or before the sky goes completely black. Bet on the latter. But I will be peeking between my fingers, preferring the former. Maimed by the teams of my youth, I guess I’m just a sucker for the manageable misery of 5-11.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/01/trailer-biden-goes-where-his-party-lost/', 'Full Text': 'ALLIANCE, Ohio — Joe Biden had come to town, but it wasn’t exactly easy to see him. The Democratic nominee, traveling through eastern Ohio on a chartered train, had stopped here for a socially distanced speech and news conference, with invited guests gathered at the station. Across the tracks, hundreds of people rallied, unable to hear the candidate. Even if they\\'d wanted to, supporters of President Trump had brought a sound system, alternating loudly between songs like “God Bless the USA” and audio clips of Biden\\'s gaffes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“He’s doing an interview right now — let’s make sure he hears us!” one Republican organizer shouted through a bullhorn. “Former Democrats for Trump! Let\\'s hear you!”\\n\\nBiden supporters outnumbered the Trump supporters, but only barely. Nobody was surprised. Until the past few weeks, Ohio was seen as a lock for the Trump campaign, a swing state that had swung, thanks to conservative Democrats in this part of Ohio walking away from the party. Biden\\'s campaign, which bought a few ads around the party\\'s August convention, has expanded its buy, adding ads in the Mahoning Valley media market that Democrats lost badly four years ago.\\n\\nBut unlike some parts of the Midwest, which moved back toward Democrats in 2016, eastern and Appalachian Ohio stayed red in 2018. Household names who\\'d won it easily before, like Sen. Sherrod Brown, saw their vote share decline. The Democrats\\' post-debate optimism is running up against decades-long trends, and local Republican parties that have successfully defined themselves around the president — antiabortion, pro-police and against laissez-faire trade deals. Biden’s stops, which focused on health care and tax fairness, were designed to give voters another, more populist option.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBiden’s six-city tour was focused mostly on places where Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign had cratered. “I think some we can win back; others, it\\'s about cutting the margin,” Biden told reporters late Wednesday, when the tour was over. “A lot of White, working-class Democrats thought we forgot them and didn\\'t pay attention. I want them to know I mean sincerely that I\\'m going to be your president, I hear them, I listen to them. I get it. I get their sense of being left behind.”\\n\\nDemocrats have said that about rural areas and working-class White voters across the country. Ohio, until recently, just seemed too far out of reach. Barack Obama had won it by three points in 2012, not far off his national margin in the popular vote. Democrats, having watched nervously as thousands of their eastern Ohio voters pulled Republican primary ballots to support Trump, were hopeful that Trump\\'s unpopularity in suburbs would override any losses in rural areas. They were wrong. Clinton lost the state by nine points, far behind her average across the country.\\n\\nJust as the exodus of White working-class Democrats had turned West Virginia into a red state, just as it had ended Missouri\\'s decades-long status as a bellwether, fate seemed to knock Ohio out of the front-line swing states. In 2019, when the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA revealed its ad strategy for 2020, it notably left out Ohio. The explanation: “If Ohio is in play, we’ll have already won the easier states and have 270 electoral votes.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat\\'s still how Democrats view this state — flippable only if Biden is winning in a rout. Zack Space, a former Democratic congressman from the region who lost a statewide race for auditor in 2018, said he was surprised by how few former Democrats crossed back to support the party then, without Trump on the ballot. The difference-maker, he suggested, was Trump\\'s focus on “the idea that there was an invasion of Mexicans, coming in a caravan.” Trump might try that again, but the effects of the novel coronavirus might have loosened up his support.\\n\\n“We all know that Biden’s going to run up the score in urban and suburban areas, but the question is whether he can mitigate the damage in this region,” Space said. “If he loses 42-58, instead of 35-65, he could pull out a win statewide. And I think that\\'s possible. When I drive through, I see some Biden signs. Four years ago, the only Hillary Clinton signs I saw were ‘Hillary for Prison.’”\\n\\nAlliance, a city of 22,000 that had lost a quarter of its population since the 1960s, was the sort of place that had elected Trump. It\\'s split between Stark County, which had tended to break narrowly for the winner in statewide elections, and Mahoning County, which contains Youngstown, the biggest Democratic stronghold between Cleveland and Pittsburgh. Trump won Stark by 17 points and lost Mahoning by just three. Every precinct between Youngstown and Alliance backed the president.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn a series of interviews here, Democrats said they were encouraged to see less visible opposition to Biden than they\\'d seen for Clinton. But they didn\\'t see the kind of support Obama used to get, much less Bill Clinton.\\n\\n“I kind of thought I was the only Biden voter in Alliance,” said Tony Lamonica, a 64-year-old retired computer programmer who\\'d come down to the station to support the candidate.\\n\\nThe president\\'s supporters were far more visible, even if they didn\\'t bother to join the peaceful protest of Biden. Daisy Blankenship, 35, who managed a store with her husband, had draped a Trump flag across its windows and planted more Trump signs in the yard, across from her son\\'s toys.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It\\'s not the Democrats for the workers, like it uses to be. It\\'s more about control,” Blankenship said. “Keep everybody at home. Give them free cheese and a check in the mail.” Asked about Trump\\'s policies, she focused on his experience before entering the White House. “He\\'s not a politician. He\\'s a businessman. He\\'s unique.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOther former Democrats — some, but not all of the voters who said they supported the president — had specific gripes with the party. It had become centered on “socialism.” It had lurched toward “globalism.” It had become too critical of police and supportive of civil unrest, an issue that had not reached yet fever pitch in 2016. And it had not worked as hard as Trump to renegotiate international trade deals.\\n\\n\"Bill Clinton was good president,\" said Jody Burkey, 53, who said his scrap metal business had begun booming the day after Trump\\'s election. \"The economy was doing good at the time. But some of the things that he did — you know, the after-effects of NAFTA and whatnot — kind of destroyed our country.\"\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDemocrats had a theory that some, not all, of their lost voters could be brought back under the tent. Republicans had a reality: They kept adding voters and took special notice when those people said, proudly, that they had pulled Democratic ballots for years and never would again.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“When I moved here 15 years ago, the county was blue, top to bottom, just like Cleveland,” said Cindy Spink, the GOP chairwoman of Ashtabula County — north of Youngstown, blue in 2012, and the site of a 19-point Trump victory in 2016. “And now we have Democrats who walk into our headquarters and say they\\'re voting straight Republican, down the ticket. It just keeps happening.

Miles Coleman\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe map is shifting in one direction, for now.\\n\\nOn the trail\\n\\nIt got lost in the chaos of Tuesday night\\'s debate, but one of the most surprising exchanges between Trump and Biden centered on something Trump had said he wanted to do for years: appoint a Supreme Court justice inclined to overturn Roe v. Wade.\\n\\n“That\\'s on the ballot as well, in the court,” Biden said of the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide. “That\\'s also at stake right now.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump appeared to startle Biden by disputing that point. “You don\\'t know what\\'s on the ballot,” he said. “Why is it on the ballot?” Talking over the Democratic nominee, the president insisted there was “nothing happening” on Roe and that bringing his Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, into the conversation made no sense.\\n\\n\\n\\n“You don\\'t know her view on Roe v. Wade,” Trump said. “You don\\'t know her view.”\\n\\nOutside the debate hall, that\\'s not how conservatives view Barrett. Sen. Josh Hawley (Mo.), who had said he would support only a nominee dedicated to overturning Roe, has told reporters that Barrett meets the test. Barrett, who was a conservative academic for far longer than she\\'s been a judge, is also on the record against abortion, co-signing a letter 14 years ago in which conservatives said they would “oppose abortion on demand and defend the right to life from fertilization to natural death” and “pray to end abortion.”\\n\\nYet outside of deep red states, Republicans have been a little reluctant to put Barrett forward as the answer to 48 years of organizing — a judge who could overturn Roe. In her first debate this week with Democrat Theresa Greenfield, Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, like Trump, challenged the premise that Barrett would rule as Hawley expected her to rule.\\n\\n“I think the likelihood of Roe v. Wade being overturned is very minimal,” she said. “I don\\'t see that happening.”\\n\\nIf there\\'s a dispute here, it\\'s what “overturning Roe” means. In the initial stage of the fight against the ruling, antiabortion conservatives favored a Human Life Amendment that would constitutionally prohibit the practice, defining life as beginning at the moment of conception. Many conservatives still support that, and while there was no Republican Party platform this year, the 2016 platform (still in effect) backs a Human Life Amendment.\\n\\nBut there is no clear path to passing such an amendment, which would require approval from 34 states. There is a path to confirming conservative judges who will approve of restrictive abortion laws, which opponents call “TRAP Laws,” designed to make abortion effectively illegal. This past summer, the Supreme Court struck down a Louisiana law designed to wipe out most legal abortion in the state by requiring doctors who performed them to have admitting privileges at hospitals.\\n\\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. joined in that decision with the court\\'s four liberals — one of whom died last month. The assumption made by Hawley and others is that laws designed like this could survive scrutiny if Barrett were to join the court and vote with her four most reliably conservative colleagues. Some Democratic-run states have passed laws that would keep abortion legal if Roe were wiped out or a new court blew some holes in it. But in Republican states, or states where antiabortion Democrats still control key votes, it would be open season, and it\\'s unclear what would happen to people who crossed state lines to have a procedure now criminalized in their state.\\n\\nThat\\'s more complicated than the usual 30-second ad or debate answer, so in court fights, Democrats tend to shorthand their goal as “preserving Roe v. Wade.” Republicans and social conservatives, who\\'ve been winning more of these state battles than they\\'ve lost, tend to stay away from discussing Roe and push Democrats on less popular, narrower aspects of legal abortion — whether taxpayers should fund abortion, whether a viable fetus revealed to have some health or developmental problem should be legal to terminate, and so on. At the start of this cycle, in early 2019, some in the antiabortion movement were hopeful that they could hang looser abortion laws around the Democrats, accusing them of favoring “infanticide” if they did not require doctors to do everything possible to keep babies alive if delivered during botched abortions.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court fight reset that debate. Trump\\'s debate answer was markedly different from the one he gave about the court four years ago, in the final debate with Hillary Clinton. The moderator, coincidentally, was the same one who handled Tuesday\\'s debate: Fox News host Chris Wallace.\\n\\n“I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint — and I’ve named 20 of them — the justices that I’m going to appoint will be pro-life,” Trump said. He expanded on that in a later question, about the effects of overturning Roe: “If that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states.”\\n\\n“Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v. Wade?” Wallace asked.\\n\\n“Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that’s really what’s going to be — that will happen,” Trump said. “And that’ll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.”\\n\\nAd watch\\n\\nPresident Trump, “President Trump\\'s Supreme Court Pick: Amy Coney Barrett.” The last time there was a Supreme Court vacancy this close to an election, the newest technology for political communication was the telegraph. So, this is a first: a presidential reelection spot all about the president\\'s nominee. Here, Barrett is described as a “proud Christian and mother of seven,” and voters are warned that Democrats are “attacking Barrett\\'s faith and family.” But because elected Democrats have steered far away from discussing Barrett\\'s Catholicism — clumsy 2017 attempts to do so helped make her a star — the only voice in the ad is HBO host Bill Maher, an atheist who said after Barrett\\'s nomination that the nominee was “really, really Catholic.”\\n\\nSteve Daines, “Pre-Existing Conditions.” It\\'s a rite of passage in this year\\'s Senate races: Republican incumbents (and challengers) saying that they\\'d never support the elimination of Obamacare-style health-care protections, though they had voted to repeal the law. Daines says here that Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock, is “using my vote to fix the Obamacare mess to lie to you about preexisting conditions.” Daines says he supports them, in terms we\\'ve seen in other GOP ads.\\n\\nAmericans for Prosperity Action, “Thom Tillis: Freedom in Health Care.” The Koch-funded grass-roots group has been on the ground in North Carolina for weeks, with a door-to-door campaign and messaging on its main 2020 theme: health-care choice, with no mention of repealing the ACA. “Thom Tillis supports getting government out of the way in our health care,” one voter says. “Thom Tillis has voted to make our health care more accessible and more affordable.”\\n\\nLindsey O. Graham, “100 Years.” In his first competitive race since 2002, and his most expensive race ever by a long shot, Graham has portrayed Democratic Jaime Harrison as a down-the-line leftist, while also emphasizing the resources a senior senator can bring back to state. The focus here is the funding secured for dredging the Port of Charleston in 2019: “Lindsey Graham went to work. Reaching across the aisle, he secured federal funding to make Charleston the deepest on the east coast.”\\n\\nDan Sullivan, “Fighting By Our Side.” Elected in 2014, narrowly, Sullivan hasn\\'t established himself in Alaska as strongly as Graham has in South Carolina. The initial premise here is similar to the one in Graham\\'s ad: Sullivan helped with “securing military construction money for the F-35 at Allison, and missile defense at Fort Greeley and Clear.” The angle is that Al Gross, the independent running as the Democratic nominee, would “empower Bernie Sanders, the author of defund the military,” if Democrats won the Senate. There\\'s no bill dubbed “defund the military,” but Sanders has proposed military budget cuts, and they\\'d be more likely if Republicans lost power.\\n\\nDavid Perdue, “Experience.” Georgia Republicans were a little surprised by the resilience of Jon Ossoff, an unsuccessful 2017 candidate for Congress who was not the Democrats\\' first choice for this race. Perdue has been updating some of the arguments the party made then: that Ossoff had a thin résumé (a Hill staffer and investigative filmmaker) and would be led around by the “radical left.” Here, a narrator says that Ossoff hasn\\'t “created an American job,” while Perdue, who rose from semi-obscurity in 2014 by running as a successful businessman, has created “thousands.\"\\n\\nYou are reading The Trailer, the newsletter that brings the campaign trail to your inbox.\\n\\n\\n\\nPoll watch\\n\\nWould you like to see the ACA remain in place?

Wade\\n\\nNo: 55%\\n\\nYes: 37%\\n\\nNew York-based Quinnipiac has consistently found outstanding numbers for Democrats in Southern states — which has made partisans a little wary of trusting their horse race numbers. This poll, which found both the state\\'s Senate race and the presidential race within the margin of error, found 35 percent of White voters backing Biden and 36 percent backing Jaime Harrison, levels of White support unseen in the state in federal elections since the 1990s. The same electorate trusts Trump more than Biden to make Supreme Court appointments, with a caveat: The prospects of a new court overturning Roe v. Wade and invalidating the Affordable Care Act are not popular.\\n\\nThere\\'s a racial gap on those questions. Just 42 percent of White voters say they disagree with Roe, which is low in a reliably conservative state, and 24 percent of Black voters say the same. But while 55 percent of White voters want the ACA invalidated, just 5 percent of Black voters do, nearly half the proportion of Black voters who support Trump over Biden.\\n\\nIn the states\\n\\nRepublicans, looking for footholds on this year\\'s Senate map, are putting more money into Michigan, where donor favorite John James has trailed Democratic Sen. Gary Peters but kept the race within single digits.\\n\\nAs first reported by Roll Call, the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, will spend $9 million in Michigan; that comes a week after Americans for Prosperity Action, which had not included the race in its initial set of 2020 investments, began running ads that portray James, who runs a logistics company in Detroit, as a candidate who can “jump start” the state\\'s economy. The tone\\'s the same as James\\'s own ads: Peters, an unflashy senator whose 2014 win came over a weak opponent, hasn\\'t been visible enough or racked up major accomplishments.\\n\\n“The only thing Gary Peters has accomplished over his years in Washington is to keep Michigan’s Senate seat warm for his successor,” SLF\\'s Stephen Law told Roll Call.\\n\\nLaw\\'s network had already been involved in the race, with its One Nation affiliate running $5.4 million in ads largely about coronavirus and the economy — echoing James\\'s argument that Peters, the ranking member of the Senate\\'s Homeland Security, has some culpability for the pandemic\\'s effects because of hearings he didn\\'t attend. (As a 501(c)4 nonprofit, the group has to run some “educational” ads, which urge Peters to support a tax-cut bill that has no chance of Senate passage.) James out-fundraised Peters in every quarter of this year, too, though he ended the August primary with slightly less cash on hand.\\n\\nThe new SLF investment is smaller than the group\\'s reservations in Republican-held Arizona, Iowa, Kentucky and North Carolina. But it comes days after the Senate Majority PAC, its Democratic counterpart, announced $6.5 million in reservations to help Jaime Harrison in his challenge to Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) As the president continues to lag in polls, the Senate, where Republicans could lose two or three seats and retain control in 2021, has become more important to the party\\'s donors. (If Joe Biden were to win the election, a Vice President Kamala D. Harris would break ties on legislation and nominations in a 50-50 Senate.)\\n\\nJames substantially lagged Peters in polls this summer, after the wave of protests against police violence, but gained some ground during an ad blitz. Worth watching now: the effect of the Supreme Court battle on voter opinions. Like every Democrat running this year, Peters has linked the court fight to the fate of the Affordable Care Act, which will go before the court for the third time in November.\\n\\nThe issue\\'s been tricky for James, who\\'s said that he would prefer to “keep the parts of Obamacare that work,” a shift from his 2018 support for repealing it. After the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Peters joined the Senate Democratic caucus in calling for an appointment to be delayed until after the election, while James said cryptically that “we need to get back to those times where people from both political parties worked together.” That led to headlines like “John James stands out for not taking stance on vacant Supreme Court seat,” something Democrats, who went on the air early to blunt James, think they can exploit.\\n\\nCandidate tracker\\n\\nPresident Trump and Joe Biden both returned to the trail Wednesday, with Biden holding, literally, his most ambitious schedule of events since March: five appearances in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, with remarks at each one. The “Build Back Better Express Train Tour” stopped in Cleveland and Alliance, Ohio, then Pittsburgh, before routing to two places where Democrats had lost ground for years: Greensburg and Johnston, Pa.\\n\\nHe did a run of media interviews, too, repeatedly getting asked about the tone of the debate, whether he would take a position on “court-packing” (he wouldn\\'t), and the details of his fracking policy.\\n\\n“I can say unequivocally I will not ban fracking,” Biden told a Johnstown news station. “No, not fracking on federal land, [but] will not ban fracking. I will insist that water supply and methane leakage are taken care of.” But Biden got more questions about the court than fracking, a sign of trouble as he continues dodging the question.\\n\\nThe president raised money near Minneapolis, then went north to Duluth, Minn., for his shortest rally in a while — less than 50 minutes. As he\\'s done on other stops in the state, he attacked refugee resettlement and Rep. Ilhan Omar, the first Somali refugee elected to Congress. He also referred to an undercover sting video that baselessly accused Omar of being part of a voter fraud ring, though it was mistakenly premised on the state preventing “ballot harvesting.” (A court order has removed the state\\'s usual limit on people gathering more than three ballots to deliver them to election offices.)\\n\\n“What about Omar where she gets caught harvesting?” Trump asked. “What the hell is going on? I hope your U.S. attorney is involved. What is going on with Omar? I’ve been reading these reports for two years about how corrupted, crooked she is. Let’s get with it. Let’s get with it. I mean, frankly, harvesting is terrible, but it’s the least of the things that she has done. How the hell? Then she tells us how to run our country. Can you believe it?”\\n\\nTrump will hold a Friday night rally in Sanford, Fla., and two Saturday rallies in Wisconsin, in Janesville and Green Bay, the major cities in the southeastern and northeastern parts of the state (see a breakdown of Wisconsin\\'s political “states” here) — amid protests from Democratic leaders there, who warn that coronavirus cases have been increasing.\\n\\nKamala D. Harris will campaign in Nevada on Friday, potentially staying out west ahead of Wednesday\\'s debate with Mike Pence, in Salt Lake City.\\n\\nCountdown'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-rallies-divisive/2020/09/28/a5114d68-fea8-11ea-830c-a160b331ca62_story.html', 'Full Text': 'And he claimed — falsely — that the deadly coronavirus, which has so far killed more than 200,000 Americans, “affects virtually nobody” and that states should reopen their schools.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn eight rallies over nine days, the president has offered a closing argument to voters that is both dark and outlandish, marked by offensive rhetoric laden with grievance.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCampaign advisers and allies say Trump has been agitating to get back out on the campaign trail in defiance of the coronavirus pandemic, resuming the rallies that energize his base and became a symbol of his underdog victory in 2016. The president believes that he alone, unfiltered, and speaking directly to voters, helped lift his campaign four years ago and that it will be key to his reelection as well.\\n\\nTrump is running for a second term the only way he seems to know how: Off-script, with little to no discipline, spewing controversy and viscera from the stage. Yet if his words are divisive and shocking, they are also familiar — and may have lost some of their ability to persuade voters.\\n\\n“If he’s doing his typical base-rallying rhetoric, it doesn’t have an impact because it has already fully polarized everybody over these past four years,” said Amy Walter, national editor for the Cook Political Report.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn ABC town hall with Trump earlier this month trailed behind CBS’s “Big Brother” and NBC’s “America’s Got Talent” in the ratings. The president’s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention last month also lost in the ratings to Biden’s acceptance speech the week prior, as well as compared with his own 2016 convention speech.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA new Washington Post-ABC News poll released Sunday, meanwhile, showed the race largely unchanged since before the conventions, with Biden leading Trump by 10 points among likely voters, 54 percent to 44 percent, with the Democrat leading the incumbent by 30 points among women and with 58 percent disapproving of his handling of the coronavirus.\\n\\n“This is Trump being Trump,” said Frank Sesno, a professor at George Washington University’s School of Media & Public Affairs and a former Washington bureau chief at CNN. “This is Trump unfettered and unbound. There are no advisers around him who are warning him of the dangers of an exclusionary message.”\\n\\nStill, Sesno added, Trump’s relatively steady poll numbers reflect “remarkable stability for such an unstable time and presidency.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“He feeds red meat to his audience and his audience expects red meat,” Sesno said. “The vegetarians know this is the place for red meat and they go elsewhere.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt his recent rallies, Trump has repeatedly downplayed the coronavirus, claiming, as he did two Fridays ago in Bemidji, Minn., that “we’re rounding the turn on covid” and that his administration’s response has been “phenomenal.”\\n\\nLast Monday in Dayton, Ohio, Trump riffed that his team has done “such a good job except in terms of public relations” when it comes to the pandemic, and later that evening, several hours north in Swanton, Ohio, Trump felt emboldened enough to claim that the virus “affects virtually nobody,” and crowed, “Open your schools! Everybody open your schools!”\\n\\nBy Tuesday, in Moon Township, Pa., Trump even turned the deadly pandemic into a joke — that it sounds like “a beautiful villa.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Corona sounds like a place in Italy, a beautiful place — it’s corona,” he said. “No, it’s the China virus.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt the rally in Minnesota — which is more than 83 percent white, according to the U.S. Census Bureau — the president expounded on the greatness of the state, crediting its citizens’ high-quality genetic makeup.\\n\\n“You have good genes, you know that, right?” Trump said. “You have good genes. A lot of it’s about the genes, isn’t it? Don’t you believe that? The racehorse theory — do you think we’re so different? You have good genes in Minnesota.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd Trump painted a dystopian vision of a nation under a Biden presidency, warning in Bemidji that the state would be turned “into a refugee camp” and “overrun and destroyed if Biden and the racial left win.”\\n\\nThe next evening, in Fayetteville, N.C, Trump said with no evidence that Biden “wants to indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies” — a claim he repeated several times in the following days. In Ohio, he promised that Biden would “destroy suburbia,” adding that the former vice president would put Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who is Black, in charge of housing programs.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump’s whole gimmick, said Al Cárdenas, the former chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, is fear.\\n\\n“There’s an authoritarian move in the country, and a lot of the folks who support him seem to have bought in on this authoritarian stuff, and it’s driven nationally by fear and fear of cultural change,” Cárdenas said. “Fear is a very good tool leading to authoritarian approval, and the Trump campaign is playing this authoritarian card well.”\\n\\nThough the campaign initially curtailed Trump’s rally schedule — in part because of an embarrassing June rally in Tulsa, where a smaller-than-advertised crowd materialized — in recent weeks it has quietly resumed a more traditional schedule, albeit with mostly outdoor events.\\n\\nWalter said that Trump’s freewheeling and fiery onstage performances seem driven, in part, by his craving for the adulation and energy he gleans from massive rallies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“He seemed to just so desperately miss the crowd piece, that anytime he’s in front of a crowd, he just goes back into that crowd mode,” she said. “If this had been a normal year, where this was rally 7,000 instead of rally seven, I wonder if things would be a little different.”\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvisers say the campaign acquiesced to the president’s demand to get back out on the road, believing that rallies are a critical part of his success.\\n\\n“You can’t get good Trump — the most charismatic, magnetic personality perhaps in the history of electoral politics — without the bad Trump,” said one campaign adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share a candid assessment of the president. “The same qualities that make him this magnetic figure — the unpredictability, the comedy, the audacity — manifest themselves in good and bad ways, and if he didn’t do that, he probably wouldn’t be the same magnetic guy he is.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAides and allies say they have been exasperated by some of Trump’s recent rhetoric and believe he loses support when he is divisive and launches personal attacks. But they also say that much of what is labeled as problematic is simply overblown by the media and the Washington political class.\\n\\n“His base loves him, and again, I do not think the American electorate — be it a portion of his base or undecided parts of the electorate — are noodling over a particular line of his speech,” said Brian O. Walsh, president of America First, a pro-Trump super PAC. “It’s been four years of noise, and we need to take that into context. Every day is a new headline saying this is a travesty or this is the end of the republic, and Americans are street smart and they get it.”\\n\\nOn Thursday, at a rally in Jacksonville, Fla., the president recycled some of his controversial assaults from earlier in the week, attacking Omar and mocking NBC’s Ali Velshi, who was hit by a rubber bullet while covering protests in Minneapolis.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump mispronounced Omar’s first name before claiming he was going to win in her home state because “they’re not too fond of her in Minnesota.”\\n\\n“She has a total disrespect for our country and I think she has hatred for our country,” he said.\\n\\nPreviously, in Minnesota and Pennsylvania, Trump had also attacked Omar by talking about the U.S. citizen as a foreigner. “She’s telling us how to run our country,” Trump said Tuesday night in Moon Township. “How did you do where you came from? How is your country doing?”\\n\\nVelshi, too, was a repeat target of Trump’s scorn, as the president regaled his crowds with a description of “that idiot reporter” getting injured covering the protests and describing it as “the most beautiful thing” and a stellar example of “law and order.”\\n\\n“Now he got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas,” Trump said Thursday. “They say it hurts, and that’s only going 52 miles an hour. A bullet goes about 2,000 miles an hour.”\\n\\nTrump, who has spent months suggesting that Biden has cognitive problems, has now begun floating baseless claims that the former vice president is taking performance-enhancing drugs. “They gave him a big fat shot in the ass and he comes out and for two hours he’s better than ever before,” Trump said, apparently alluding to his concern that Biden may turn in a strong performance when the men face off Tuesday in the first presidential debate.\\n\\n“Now we’re going to ask for a drug test, we are,” he said. “I’d like to have a drug test for both of us. I’ll take it, he’ll take it.”\\n\\nIn addition to railing against — again, without evidence — “fake ballots” from the rally stage, Trump also prompted widespread alarm this past week when he refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose in November, and preemptively threw doubt on the result of any election in which he does not prevail.\\n\\n“We want to make sure the election is honest, and I’m not sure that it can be,” the president said.\\n\\nTJ Ducklo, a Biden campaign spokesman, said the campaign will continue pressing its own message about Trump’s bungled leadership.\\n\\n“As horrible and offensive as many of his rallies are, he’s playing only to his base, not getting any meaningful media coverage, and doing nothing to appeal to the swing voters he needs to win. The musings of the hateful and erratic resident of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue will not distract our campaign from talking about the issues that impact people’s lives — Trump’s failure to protect American lives during covid, his failure to get the economy back on track, and his failure to lead on racial justice.”\\n\\nTrump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh, meanwhile, defended the president’s behavior, describing him as a counterpuncher when attacked.\\n\\n\\n\\n“President Trump gives wide-ranging remarks at his campaign events, promoting his administration’s accomplishments and warning against the leftist agenda being carried by Joe Biden,” Murtaugh said, in an email statement. “Democrats and the media have spent every day of his presidency attacking him, undermining him, and trying to defeat him, and the President is one who likes to fight back.”\\n\\nSesno said the ultimate impact of Trump’s nontraditional closing argument still remains to be seen.\\n\\n“We say Trump has not paid a price for any of his extreme rhetoric, and in one way that’s correct,” Sesno said. “His base has held and he’s overtaken the party. But in another way he’s paid a terrible price — he’s been impeached, he has low approval ratings, he’s an underdog according to the polls.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/germany-suspends-dozens-of-police-officers-for-neo-nazi-chat-messages/2020/09/16/0f10d044-f80a-11ea-85f7-5941188a98cd_story.html', 'Full Text': '“We are talking about the nastiest and most disgusting neo-Nazi, racist and refugee-hostile hatred,” Reul said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe 126 images with content punishable by law were shared in five WhatsApp chat groups that were exclusively or predominantly used by police officers.

For the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began, all 2 million Gazans are in home quarantine to slow a growing outbreak. Our movements are always restricted within Gaza’s 140 square miles, bound by the Mediterranean on one side, fenced in by the Israeli army on another. But now, as the jets strike outside for the 20th straight night, we cannot even leave our houses.\\n\\nWe are stuck in a lockdown within a lockdown.\\n\\nFor months, we’d recorded only about 100 coronavirus cases in Gaza, all among residents returning from the outside and who were immediately quarantined. But on Aug. 24, the first cases of unknown origin were reported, in the tightly packed Maghazi refugee camp, and Gaza was placed under a complete lockdown that very same night. Since then, we’ve recorded more than 1,400 local cases.\\n\\nIt is beautiful to be a parent. But in Gaza it is also especially difficult. This has been true since Adam was born 10 years ago: It was two months before I even met him because Israel’s blockade of Gaza meant I couldn’t be with his mother, Ruba, when she gave birth in the West Bank, where her family lives.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Will I be able to shield him and give him a good life in besieged Gaza?” I wondered as I marveled at my tiny boy. In the decade since, the question has never gone away. The constant cycle of escalation between Israel and Hamas, the militant group that governs here, has meant frequent explosive nights and, twice, all-out war. Rockets. More recently, Hamas and other militant groups have launched incendiary balloons that cause fires in nearby Israeli communities and farms. Israel retaliates each night by blowing up Hamas facilities. It is the violent background of our lives.\\n\\nThe boys slept, and I turned on a light to read. We are lucky that we can afford our own solar power system that provides about 70 percent of our household needs. Many of my neighbors in Gaza City, and almost all of the 600,000 people living in Gaza’s eight refugee camps, are spending the lockdown mostly in the dark.\\n\\nThe Israeli army destroyed Gaza’s main power station in the 2006 war. In the best of times, we have only eight hours of electricity a day as blackouts rotate through the neighborhoods. But three weeks ago, as a reprisal against the balloon launches, Israel cut off fuel shipments to Gaza’s last power plant. As the outbreak began to spike in late August, Gaza had only four hours of electricity a day.\\n\\nA world shrinking once again\\n\\nBeing locked in the house while also locked in our small coastal enclave is very annoying. One of the ways to stay sane while living under siege is to move around where it’s possible, to gather with your fellow Gazans at cafes, in mosques or on the beach. In the camps, social life centers on families and friends, gathering on sidewalks and apartment stoops. Now, even that connection to a normal society is cut.\\n\\nLike everywhere, Gaza has been under coronavirus restrictions for months. Restaurants have been closed or limited to takeout. Mosques and churches were shut. But everyone who entered Gaza through the checkpoints was quarantined for three weeks, and the number of infections remained low.\\n\\nMy boys had returned to school in the second week in August, after an absence of five months. The term started early in hopes that the kids could catch up on what they had missed. They were excited to get back to school and see their classmates. They had heroic achievements to share: Karam had won his karate yellow belt and Adam had learned new soccer moves. School is one of the few places where Gazan life feels normal.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWithin weeks, classes stopped again due to a sudden outbreak of new cases. The airstrikes hit every night, the pandemic was closing in and our world was shrinking once again.\\n\\nThe kids miss school as much as their parents do. Now most of their play is on PlayStation. Their social life is when the cousins and friends can join them online for a couple of hours of “Fortnite.”\\n\\nMaybe it’s good they are still too young to understand the layers of conflict and pandemic pressing on them. We are able to keep them busy. When we are free to move around, we give them a life that is rich by Gaza standards, with extended family, friends, school and public places. You want to shield them. But the reality in Gaza makes that feel increasingly like a mission impossible.\\n\\nTechnology — a blessing and a curse\\n\\nAdam and Karam get lessons every day in how their lives are different from the young people they see on their screens. They ask me when we will travel to see their grandmother in the West Bank, something that can require months to plan. Permits are needed from Israel, and sometimes from Hamas and the Palestinian Authority — all three maintain checkpoints at the one crossing into Israel for individuals. Any of them can say no, and Israel often does.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNow, even that possibility is gone.\\n\\nTechnology is a blessing that opens my kids’ minds and expands their knowledge. But it can also be curse in besieged places like Gaza. So much of what we see, we cannot do. The places brought to us by the Internet are forever out of reach. I think of my friends who won scholarships to study abroad but could not get out of Gaza to attend.\\n\\nFor many Gazans, their farthest travel is the edge of the sea, where we cool ourselves in the Mediterranean breezes and look out to a world all but closed to us.\\n\\nBut this being Gaza, even a day on the beach is complicated by conflict. There is not enough electricity to run the waste treatment plants and we cannot swim because of the untreated sewage that is pumped into the sea.\\n\\nOne evening a few days before the lockdown, I took the boys to the beach. It is always a mix of pain and pleasure to sit with them, watching them play but knowing they will run to the water’s edge and back, asking every five minutes if they can swim. I have to say no.\\n\\nSoon after the pandemic flared up, Israel and Hamas negotiated another cease-fire, brokered by Qatar. The balloons and bombs have stopped for now; we have four more hours of electricity to light our quarantine.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe know from experience that this quiet will soon cycle back to violence. Of the two lockdowns, the one caused by the virus will be the first to be resolved. We can only pray that we can keep our children safe until it is.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/burkina-fasos-wildlife-reserves-have-become-a-battle-zone-overrun-by-militants-and-poachers/2020/09/12/dae444bc-f1c0-11ea-9279-45d6bdfe145f_story.html', 'Full Text': 'The forest takeover marks another violent chapter in Burkina Faso’s four-year fight against militants loyal to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State who are vying to control vast swaths of West Africa.

Before the military plane arrived, though, the rangers had won.\\n\\nThey inspected the hideout, which contained a cache of bombs, guns and ammunition. Its occupants had fled.\\n\\nBut what stood out to Kabore was something he rarely saw in the forest: the clothing of women and children.

That’s despite it occurring months ago. Trump has occasionally wrongly described Velshi’s employer and the object that struck his knee.\\n\\n“I remember this guy, he got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas and he went down. He didn’t — he was down. My knee, my knee,” Trump said, as the crowd laughed. “Nobody cared. These guys didn’t care. They moved him aside. And they just walk through him. It was like — it was the most beautiful thing.”\\n\\nTrump added: “Wasn’t it really a beautiful sight? It’s called law and order. Law and order.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump added Monday in Ohio: “Remember they hit the CNN reporter in the knee. He went down, Ali Velshi. He said this is a friendly protest. It’s wonderful to see such a — behind him, it was all fire for blood. It looked like Berlin during the war.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump previously praised GOP Rep. Greg Gianforte (Mont.) for an assault on a reporter to which the congressman pleaded guilty. But at the time, it was couched as a joke.\\n\\nTrump has also in recent days attacked his 2020 opponent, Biden, for how much he wears a mask — something health officials encourage — and has made unsubstantiated claims of drug use and plastic surgery on Biden’s part.\\n\\n“He’s like 100 yards from the nearest human being, he’s got a — he feels good about the mask,” said Trump, who has regularly played down the need for masks and has eschewed wearing them even when in close quarters, apart from a brief period in which he labeled them “patriotic.” “I wonder in the debate, it’ll be him and I on the stage. Is he going to walk in with a mask? I’ll be honest, he feels good about — he feels good about the mask, and that’s okay.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt’s not the first time Trump has ridiculed Biden for how much he wears a mask, but it comes as health officials have doubled down on how vital they are — and as much of Trump’s base continues to buck that advice. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield said last week the protection of a mask is more guaranteed than even the effectiveness of a vaccine. Trump, though, disputed what Redfield said and has repeatedly cast doubt on their efficacy and declined to more forcefully urge their use.\\n\\nTrump went on to claim Biden is covering up plastic surgery with his mask: “I mean honestly, what the hell did he spend all that money on the plastic surgery if he’s going to cover it up with a mask? Seriously.”\\n\\nTrump has also baselessly claimed in recent days that Biden has taken drugs. Trump cited Biden’s primary debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as his supposed evidence, suggesting Biden had done better than in previous debates — and apparently adjusting expectations for his own clashes with Biden beginning at next week’s general election debate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“And I said, ‘What the hell is he taking?’ And we’d like to ask him and I said that,” Trump said. “We want a drug test. We want a drug test. We’ll both take it. We’ll both take it.”\\n\\nTrump echoed his baseless claim about Biden and drugs this weekend on Fox News.\\n\\nTrump has hit on all of these themes before — accusing his 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton of being infirm, attacking refugees as potential sleeper cells or anti-American and labeling reporters the “enemy of the American people” while suggesting approval of violence against them.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2020/09/11/trump-biden-live-updates/', 'Full Text': 'As Biden visited Ground Zero and Trump spoke in Shanksville, Pa., Democratic vice-presidential nominee Sen.

Martin Luther King Jr.) of being communists. A billboard placed on the route of the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches in Alabama showed a picture of King with the caption “Martin Luther King at Communist Training School.” The picture actually shows King at the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, a center for social justice activists.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt the time, with the ongoing U.S. war in Vietnam framed as a fight against communism, these accusations were meant to depict the civil rights movement as un-American, part of a global conflict between the United States and the communist Soviet Union. Rather than depicting activists as belonging to an American tradition of expressing dissent and working to correct injustice, opponents depicted them as an internal threat to the nation.\\n\\nIn the 1960s and again today, Americans who describe themselves as patriots accuse other Americans of treason. Now as then, this rhetoric has the potential to increase tensions and lead to more violence.\\n\\nOnline and offline significance\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStewart Rhodes is not just another disgruntled person with no audience. The Oath Keepers’ Twitter account has more than 30,000 followers. Until Facebook took it down this month, the group’s main Facebook page had more than 500,000. The group is active offline, too. In 2014, armed members of the group traveled to Nevada to participate in Cliven Bundy’s armed standoff against the government and helped to prevent the government from enforcing a court order to confiscate some of Bundy’s cattle in lieu of more than $1 million of fees and penalties that the rancher refused to pay.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nChanging priorities: from anti-government to anti-left\\n\\nAs I argue in my book about the group, since it was formed in 2009, Oath Keepers has urged its members and supporters to arm themselves and get ready for war. Until 2016, the enemy in that war was the federal government: Tyranny was right around the corner, and preserving the American republic required constant vigilance. As Rhodes said in a blog post announcing the group’s launch in 2009, “The principle [sic] mission of Oath Keepers is to prevent the destruction of American liberty by preventing a full-blown totalitarian dictatorship from coming to power.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThings changed when Donald Trump became the Republican nominee for president. At first the group was wary of Trump’s comments about gun control, but that soon changed. The Oath Keepers website ran articles predicting that the Democratic Party would engage in wide-scale voter fraud, and the group organized its members (particularly “our retired police officers, our military intelligence veterans, and our Special Warfare veterans”) to monitor polling places.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBy January, the group anticipated that violent leftists would try to prevent Trump from taking office. Rhodes and others traveled to Washington for the inauguration, saying that they would informally supplement the government’s security operation. The group claimed credit for preventing an antifa attack against the Deploraball, an inauguration party associated with the alt-right.\\n\\nIn early 2017, this reorientation was complete. In April and May, Oath Keepers brawled against antifa alongside right-wing groups in Boston and Berkeley, Calif. Though it denounced the alt-right and has long condemned racism, the group insisted that it would fight “radical leftists” to protect white supremacists’ First Amendment rights. To my knowledge, the Oath Keepers has never offered to protect the rights of leftists.\\n\\nPreparation for violence\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis reorientation is deeper than just a pivot to worrying about opponents of the current administration. Until 2016, the group regularly condemned police militarization. The group is now revealing new priorities. It no longer worries much about police militarization, about Americans being killed by law enforcement, or about Americans prevented from voicing dissent. Instead, it is worried about communists.\\n\\nRhodes also said that if Trump doesn’t mobilize the National Guard to suppress the “Communist insurrection,” his group will do the job. The group has turned out heavily armed to protests before. In Ferguson, Mo., the group first announced that its armed members would help ensure that protesters could voice dissent without fear of police violence. But once there, they instead provided “security” to three local businesses and to employees of Infowars, the “alternative” media outlet run by the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. (Oath Keepers probably would deny this characterization of its actions.)'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/minnesota-political-geography/', 'Full Text': 'Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events\\n\\nAnalysis close Interpretation of the news based on evidence, including data, as well as anticipating how events might unfold based on past events\\n\\n(Lauren Tierney/The Washington Post) ([object Object])\\n\\nSixth in a series on swing states\\n\\nFor Republicans, Minnesota has long been the one that got away.

Trump had won just 45 percent of the vote in 2016 and got close to Clinton in part because 9 percent of voters backed a third-party candidate. (Just two other states saw a higher percentage of third-party votes, Alaska and New Mexico.)

Another, the suburbs and exurbs of those cities, changed little between 2012 and 2016 but swung left in 2018. Two regions flipped from Barack Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016 — the counties from the Iron Range over to Duluth and Lake Superior, and a corner of Southeast Minnesota.

The biggest and bluest city in the state, it had been getting more Democratic for years, but Keith Ellison — then the city’s congressman, now the state’s attorney general — put special emphasis on turning out the vote. The result, a 148,892-vote landslide in Minneapolis, was the biggest for any Democratic candidate ever, and it put Clinton over the top statewide. Minneapolis and St. Paul now make up the core of the Democratic vote, and their surrounding counties, Hennepin and Ramsey, pad the total. Clinton carried every town in Ramsey and flipped several Hennepin towns that Obama had lost; two years later, places like Eden Prairie were crucial to the successful Democratic effort to flip the House. When the Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) Party went all-in this year to support Rep.

From 2012 to 2016, the GOP margin in the region rose by just 5,415 votes, and a lot of that had to do with the vote for third-party candidates — that number grew by 47,880, as the raw Republican vote fell by 16,926. Minnesota was one of 11 states where independent conservative Evan McMullin made the ballot that year, and he got 2 percent of the vote here while the Libertarian candidate cleared 4 percent. Republicans view those voters as gettable for Trump. Democrats aren’t convinced. “These have been Republican areas for years, but they’ve trended Democratic in recent cycles,” DFL chair Ken Martin said. “You’ve got Fortune 500 executives, in wealthy neighborhoods, who are not comfortable with Trump.” Democrats, who are trying to flip the GOP-controlled state senate this cycle, are hoping to build on some of their exurban gains from the midterms. Democratic Gov. Tim Walz carried three of the region’s five counties; Sen. Amy Klobuchar, whose appeal to Republicans was central to her presidential campaign, carried them all. With Klobuchar’s endorsement, Biden demolished the competition here in the 2020 primary, which Democrats saw as a clue that he could win some Republicans who’ve grown uncomfortable with the party in the Trump era. 2016 vote total Donald Trump 326,644 Hillary Clinton 303,094 2016 vote totals Donald Trump: 326,644\\n\\nHillary Clinton: 303,094 Counties included: Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Scott, Washington\\n\\nIron Range Compared with the state overall, the voting population here … Has a lower share of people living in cities than average .\\n\\nof people living in cities than average .

(Lauren Tierney/The Washington Post) ([object Object]) For decades, the small mining towns of northeastern Minnesota were strongholds of unionized, Democratic votes — vastly outvoted by the Twin Cities but crucial for the party’s statewide win margin and usually represented by the party in Congress. That began to change in 2010, and the floor fell out in 2016, when Trump swept the Iron Range. Republicans picked up the region’s House seat in 2018, and polling has found Biden, who has embraced more rigorous environmental standards than he did when he ran for vice president, losing the Iron Range even when he leads statewide. There may be more votes for Republicans to pick up here, even in the counties east of the range that stayed blue in 2016. Duluth, which casts almost a quarter of the region’s total vote, broke for the Democratic ticket by 37 points in 2012, then by just 29 points in 2016. The falloff for Democrats in smaller cities was dramatic, and the Republican National Convention highlighted a number of Minnesotans who advanced the party’s case: The pro-green-energy, pro-abortion-rights, pro-gun-control version of the Democratic Party didn’t represent northeastern Minnesota. 2016 vote total Donald Trump 101,186 Hillary Clinton 96,679 2016 vote totals Donald Trump: 101,186\\n\\nHillary Clinton: 96,679 Counties included: Aitkin, Carlton, Cook, Crow Wing, Itasca, Koochiching, Lake, St. Louis\\n\\nSoutheast Compared with the state overall, the voting population here … Has a lower share of people living in cities than average .\\n\\nof people living in cities than average .

Unlike other rural areas, Democrats in 2018 were able to win much of it back; in Minnesota that was thanks, in part, to gubernatorial candidate Tim Walz winning the 1st Congressional District, which covers the region. Republican Rep. Jim Hagedorn flipped that district by one point, but Trump had won it by 15. What changed? Clinton lost eight counties that had backed Obama twice and won only around the city of Rochester, where the Mayo Clinic has fostered a population of college-educated White voters. The midterm’s Democrats won many of those people back, as voters in the suburbs of cities like Mankato and Winona broke against Republicans.

Elected officials who are willing to lean into demagoguery have sought to exploit the pandemic for their own purposes — and in many cases, they may be succeeding.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA new report released Friday by Freedom House, a nongovernmental, nonpartisan advocacy organization established in 1941, found that since the start of the pandemic, the state of democracy and human rights has worsened in at least 80 countries out of 192 nations surveyed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe report is based on an anonymous online survey of 398 experts and the work of Freedom House’s own analysts. It presents a troubling paradox: The pandemic has made the case for political participation more urgent, while at the same time disrupting democratic institutions that enable that participation.\\n\\nProtests are one example. Freedom House identified significant political protests in at least 90 countries since the outbreak began. In many cases, the virus has helped to trigger action over long-standing grievances — protesters in authoritarian Belarus, for example, were brought out by both a disputed election and a lackluster and opaque pandemic response.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut, concurrently, restrictions on protests have spread dramatically during this time of unrest: Freedom House counted 158 countries where some form of new legislation has restricted protest during the pandemic, including some established democracies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis week in Israel, where demonstrations against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have continued for months, the country’s parliament approved lockdown plans that would effectively end protests. “More than a campaign against the pandemic, this is a campaign against dissent,” the journalist Gershom Gorenberg wrote.\\n\\nThe problem is acute in developing nations or countries where democracy was already under threat. As a respondent to the Freedom House survey said of Turkey, the pandemic “was used as an excuse for the already oppressive government to do things that it has long planned to do, but had not been able to.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn countries such as Egypt, Zimbabwe and Cambodia, governments were reported to be using emergency powers to crack down on political opposition. “The judiciary has become a puppet of the executive branch,” a respondent said of Serbia, noting that trials were “conducted via video link, without the presence of defense attorneys.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nExperts from 66 countries said the virus had “led to a proliferation of disinformation coming from the government” in their nation. Assessing accurate information had become more difficult due to crackdowns on freedom of speech — in at least 91 of 192 countries studied, there were restrictions on news media.\\n\\nIn nine countries, national elections have been disrupted by the pandemic. Freedom House points to places like Sri Lanka, where an election planned for April was postponed, effectively allowing President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to rule without an opposition-held legislature for months.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen that election was finally held in August, Rajapaksa’s party “won the elections in a landslide, adding to fears that he and his brother, former president and current prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, would consolidate power and build an authoritarian regime,” Freedom House noted.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe U.S. presidential election is given its own section in the report. “Many experts have expressed doubt that local election authorities across the country are prepared for the November elections, citing increased demand for voting by mail, likely staffing shortfalls, and last-minute changes to electoral rules,” the report states.\\n\\nThe Trump administration created “a fog of misinformation” amid the pandemic, Freedom House asserts, while the country’s death toll rose to the highest total in the world, at over 200,000. Such concerns increased after a divisive performance by President Trump at a presidential debate on Tuesday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Our motherland of democracy has gone down a dangerous path,” Stephan Bierling, an international politics professor at the University of Regensburg in Germany, told my colleagues, referring to the United States.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis global political impact will probably outlive the virus. Of the 398 experts Freedom House surveyed, 64 percent said the impact of the coronavirus on their country would be mostly negative for up to five years, long after experts believe the virus will have faded as a major public health problem.\\n\\nThat may be underselling it. In a separate poll released Thursday, 69 percent of Americans said that the upcoming U.S. presidential election was the most important of their lifetime. It’s hard to imagine that many view that in a positive manner: There are fears of post-election violence from militias if Trump loses.\\n\\nNot all democracies are flailing. The report notes the positive appraisals experts had of Tunisia, which provided aid to refugees and minorities during the pandemic despite the country’s economic devastation, and Georgia, which implemented “strict but transparent” measures and has one of the world’s lowest death rates.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnlike in times of war, there appears to be little “rally around the flag” sentiment in countries seen to have handled the virus badly. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who commands a sizable parliamentary majority and is not up for election until 2024, is facing a rebellion from his own former backers.\\n\\nEven in authoritarian countries, democratic activism seems to be remarkably persistent. “Democracy is suffering around the world, but the public’s demand for it has not been extinguished,” Freedom House noted, referring to the protests in Belarus.\\n\\nFreedom House offers some solutions for democratic backsliding amid the pandemic — sensible measures like combating corruption and ensuring emergency powers have time limits.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe problem with that, as Today’s WorldView has noted before, is that pandemics have a habit of reinforcing society’s faults. Before the pandemic began this year, Freedom House warned that for the 14th year in a row, political freedoms and civil liberties across the world were backsliding.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe pandemic may be a tipping point rather than a turning point.

As the government scrambles to repair and restart its fuel-processing capacity, analysts are warning that ruptured pipelines, rusting tankers and rickety refineries are contributing to a mounting ecological disaster in this failing socialist state.\\n\\nOil workers say the gushing crude soiling the coast of Falcón state this month came from a cracked underwater pipeline linked to attempts to restart fuel production at the aging Cardón refinery. Not far from the oil slick, fishermen say, is a jetting geyser of natural gas from a second broken pipeline.\\n\\n“The gas leak looks like a boiling pot about to explode,” González said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe leaks are the latest in a spate of oil industry troubles that have alarmed environmentalists here. They include a recent oil spill that has jeopardized corals and rare marine life off sensitive Morrocoy National Park, and a rusting vessel in the Gulf of Paria that observers call a ticking ecological time bomb. Analysts see a growing risk of more and larger spills in a country that has already suffered years of damage from broken wells and abandoned oil fields.\\n\\n“Our fear is that as they try to fix and restart these refineries and oil centers, we’re only going to see more of this,” said Cristina Burelli, international liaison for SOSOrinoco, a nonprofit focused on environmental damage in Venezuela. “More underground oil pipelines are blowing up. The whole system is corroded and falling apart.”\\n\\nA rash of gold mining — much of it illegal — has contributed to a surge of pollutants in the Venezuelan interior, endangering the important ecosystem at Canaima National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site. And illicit logging has jeopardized rainforest. But in this OPEC nation that sits on the world’s largest proven oil reserves, the biggest driver of environmental damage is the crumbling energy sector.\\n\\nParticularly in recent years, a lack of spare parts, a brain drain of technicians and widespread corruption have crippled oil production and fuel refineries, making environmental accidents more common. Between 2010 and 2016, the state oil giant PDVSA was responsible for more than 46,000 spills of crude and other pollutants, according to the Caracas-based human rights group Provea.\\n\\nIn the Connecticut-size Lake Maracaibo, thousands of wells now stand broken and useless, with raw crude and natural gas bubbling visibly to the surface. In 2016, the last year data was available, state engineers estimated that tens of thousands of gallons of oil were seeping into the lake each month.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe U.S. embargo on Venezuelan oil has deepened the industry’s woes. The country lacks the capacity to process much of its sludgy product. When it sent crude to the United States, it got back refined gasoline. The end of that system has worsened severe fuel shortages. The need to store extra crude that Venezuela cannot sell under the embargo, as well as the government’s attempts to revamp and restart old refineries to increase domestic fuel production, appears to be driving the recent spills, analysts and oil workers say.\\n\\nThe country’s diplomatic isolation has exacerbated the problem. The United States and more than 50 other countries consider President Nicolás Maduro a usurper; they recognize National Assembly President Juan Guaidó as the country’s rightful leader.\\n\\nUnlike Mauritius, which recently called for international aid after a Japanese tanker spilled more than 1,000 tons of oil off its pristine coast, the Venezuelan government has few friends to turn to — and so has largely downplayed the spills.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It breaks my heart,” said Julia Alvarez, a marine biologist here. “This is an ecological crime.”\\n\\nAnalysts began monitoring the first of the recent spills in August.\\n\\nEduardo Klein, director of the Remote Sensors Laboratory in the department of environmental studies at Simón Bolívar University, used satellite images to document a massive oil slick washing up on the beaches of Morrocoy National Park, a sensitive ecosystem of corals, sponges and sea turtles on the Caribbean coast. The images, he said, suggested the spill originated at a refinery in Carabobo state.\\n\\n“It can be seen without a doubt that there is a very large stain in front of El Palito refinery,” he said. “There is no way this stain had any other origin.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKlein estimated the spill at 26,000 barrels of oil over 135 square miles, the largest in the area in at least 20 years.\\n\\nAccording to local news reports, El Palito refinery suffered a failure at the end of July, when workers tried to reactivate it in an effort to refine fuel. Ivan Feites, an oil union board member, said the facility’s compressor pumps, turbines and pipes remain severely damaged.\\n\\n“That’s what causes spills every time they try to restart the refinery,” Feites said. “The refinery doesn’t work and can’t produce fuel. It’s like a piece of cardboard that easily breaks.”\\n\\nThe Venezuelan government has not acknowledged the origin of the spill, but said in a statement last month that Morrocoy’s animal and plant life had not been damaged. The National Assembly has opened an investigation; opposition officials have suggested that the refinery’s waste pit might have overflowed because of heavy rains and a lack of maintenance.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Venezuelan government did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nOn the other side of the country, analysts and oil workers are growing increasingly concerned about the FSO Nabarima, a rusting vessel laden with 1.3 million barrels of crude that is taking on water in the Gulf of Paria. They fear the floating storage and offloading unit is at risk of sinking and creating a major environmental disaster in the Caribbean Sea.\\n\\nEudis Girot, head of the anti-government Unitary Federation of Petroleum Workers of Venezuela, posted photos on social media showing what he described as the ship’s already flooded engine room. In a video posted to social media, he begged Maduro to intervene.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Take a helicopter,” he said. “Go out there. Do your own inspection.”\\n\\nPDVSA confirmed the most recent oil spill, near its Cardón refinery. The oil giant said this month that the leak occurred in an underwater pipeline and cleanup was underway.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGonzález, who grew up fishing with his uncle on the coast of Falcón, said he and other fisherman worry the spill will ruin their livelihoods. Environmentalists, meanwhile, say it could affect populations of dolphins, crocodiles, seabirds and green turtles.\\n\\n“We have never seen a spill like this,” said González. “For years, no one has come to do maintenance on the refineries. Now it turns out that they are polluting everything with oil, and nobody seems to care.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/10/12/gisele-fetterman-pennsylvania-verbal-assault/', 'Full Text': '“She said, ‘There’s that n-word that Fetterman married.

When not speaking, I glance furtively at my profile window: Does my smile look like a smirk? Does my “church face” look attentive or hostile? Wait, who’s talking now? Nonverbal cues are flattened, muted or delayed, so my reactions are perpetually slightly out of sync with everyone else’s.\\n\\nBy the time the call ends, I’m in a flop sweat from trying to communicate while also self-monitoring every voluntary and involuntary movement of my face and body. An hour of this leaves me both amped up and depleted, like an empty-calorie snack.\\n\\nThe popular name for this condition is “Zoom fatigue,” but to people with sensory processing differences, attention-deficit disorder or autism, it’s Tuesday. Interviewing neurodiversity experts and advocates, I learn about adaptations that help neurodiverse individuals navigate daily interactions — rules for engagement, pre-reads, defined agendas, follow-ups for clarity — and how they can also keep virtual meeting participants on track and engaged. In having to consciously adapt to an uncomfortable new-to-me experience, I’ve learned a more effective and efficient way to work. Accessibility advocates call this the curb-cut effect: An accommodation designed for a minority becomes a ubiquitous feature everyone can benefit from.\\n\\nTo illustrate the post-pandemic workplace, I could interview HR and real estate experts about reconfigured office space, real estate footprints, telework. After decades of open-plan enthusiasts touting the benefits of wide-open workplaces — Synergy! Flat organization! The air crackling with spontaneous interfacing! — the novel coronavirus had us backpedaling seemingly overnight. Employers embraced telecommuting, installed barriers and started giving employees a little more personal space.\\n\\nIn having to consciously adapt to an uncomfortable new-to-me experience, I’ve learned a more effective and efficient way to work.\\n\\nI could joke about how complaints in my inbox about co-workers’ noise and smells and distractingly low-cut shirts have been replaced by complaints about open-mouth chewers on videoconferences and co-workers with noses protruding outside their masks.\\n\\nI could discuss how the crisis burned away needless workplace constructs and principles from bygone eras. Like the wide-eyed, pajama-clad professional in the Emily Flake New Yorker cartoon, many of us came to the startling epiphany that those meetings really could all have been emails.\\n\\nI could fret about the threats to employee privacy presented by temperature screenings and contact-tracing apps. I might speculate whether having coronavirus antibodies will become a factor in deciding who gets certain high-profile client assignments and travel opportunities. (It sounds dystopian, but there’s a reason we had to enact a law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. Like Dr. Seuss’s “Sneetches,” we can turn any personal feature into an excuse to discriminate.)\\n\\nBut what I’m really interested in are the less visible changes the pandemic has wrought. Being forced into uncomfortable, new-to-us situations has given many of us an opening to reconsider how we think about ourselves as workers, the value we place on different kinds of work and the kinds of working conditions we’re willing to accept going forward. It’s also created incentive to listen more closely to the voices that had been calling for change all along.\\n\\n[2019 Top Workplaces]\\n\\nOutrage burns hot, fueled by injustice — and in 2020, dry tinder is everywhere to be found. In the workplace context, the lowest-paid workers turned out to be some of the most essential ones, and the ones at greatest risk, when the shutdowns began. They were stocking the shelves and driving the trucks and delivering the supplies we needed to survive. They were running double shifts at hospitals and going into full-time quarantine at nursing homes with their vulnerable charges. Not surprisingly, a disproportionate number of those workers were also low on the privilege ladder in terms of race and citizenship status. Black, Native American, Latino and immigrant communities suffered disproportionate loss of life because medical resources were out of reach and staying at home without pay was simply not an option.\\n\\nAnd when workers like these were rewarded in inverse proportion to the importance of their work — when they were ordered back to their jobs without proper sanitation or PPE; when they were fired for refusing to expose themselves or for raising their voices in protest; when they were stiffed on promised tips and hazard pay — we were outraged.\\n\\nThe problem with outrage is that it usually burns hot, then quickly cools into ashy indifference. But occasionally, something keeps the coals of that outrage banked and smoldering: empathy.\\n\\nThe pandemic has forced empathy on us; it has pinched our noses shut and forced us to hold those coals in our mouths.\\n\\nPre-pandemic, although I endorsed the idea of mental health days, I seldom admitted to taking them. But over the spring, as the news cycle unfurled fresh hell by the minute like a fractal of horrors, I was forced to accept that every two or three functional days would be followed by a day of recovery. Allostatic overload, the term for what happens to a brain processing stress signals nonstop, was consuming my mental and physical resources faster than I could replenish them.\\n\\nAt my day job, colleagues and I joked about scheduling our respective breakdowns so we could cover for each other. Discussing our emotional state became the norm; the “function, function, collapse” cycle was something we all could empathize with.\\n\\n(Jenn Liv For The Washington Post)\\n\\n‘Time Confetti’\\n\\nAs a mom with a full-time day job and a fulfilling but challenging side gig, I’ve long been used to robbing Mary to pay Peter and Paul. I was already intimately familiar with the concept of what Brigid Schulte in her book “Overwhelmed: Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time” calls “time confetti”— where blocks of productive time are fragmented and disrupted by the overlapping demands of work, family and the effort required — usually from mothers — to manage it all.\\n\\nCoronavirus shredded that time confetti down to its atomic components and blasted it with a leaf blower. When schools and summer camps closed, like every other parent, I suddenly had an additional full-time gig. Every task and email and meeting had to be trimmed and shimmed and sanded to fit alongside overseeing classwork, fixing meals and refereeing conflicts. TV and iPads bought me more time than I care to admit, but granting screen time is like feeding a Mogwai after dark: While I banged out emails, my brain was constantly keeping track of how many minutes were left until the figurative midnight stroke when my docile critters would transform into feral, overstimulated Gremlins.\\n\\nStill, I was lucky; from day one of the pandemic, my managers, parents or not, encouraged us all to take care of family first. And shortly thereafter when I moved into my own place as a divorced co-parent, I began alternating my “time confetti” custodial weeks with weeks of what felt like superhuman productivity, when I only had my one-and-a-half paying jobs to focus on. But I’ve never quite been able to shake off the low-level anxiety familiar to most working parents: Will I be penalized, subtly if not overtly, for taking advantage of emergency benefits or asking others to work around my needs?\\n\\nMy fears are stoked by stories like the one from a worker who was fired because she couldn’t prevent her preschooler and infant from being heard in the background on client calls and the successful business owner who shuttered her small company because her husband — “on a break” from his own career — couldn’t manage looking after their 3-year-old. Working-mom empathy keeps my outrage for them alive. I can too easily imagine myself in their place.\\n\\nNow that … what’s next?\\n\\nIt feels ghoulish to think of an apocalyptic event like the coronavirus pandemic in terms of opportunity. But I can’t help believing that the pandemic has stripped away the official excuses for denying living wages, paid leave and flexible, inclusive workplaces. Within weeks, paid leave and supplemental income laws that had always been deemed too expensive and complicated to implement were hastily kludged together — patchwork parachutes and duct-tape tourniquets to slow our fall and keep us alive until the crisis waned. Accommodations that had been broadly denied as burdensome or damaging to productivity suddenly became standard operating procedure. Now that we’ve seen how vital these protections are, how do we go back to not having them at all?\\n\\nAnd on an individual level, the pandemic has stripped away our excuses for refusing to understand other people’s struggles.\\n\\nNow that we’ve experienced a fraction of the financial and existential vertigo many people live with daily, how can we deny them a stronger safety net?\\n\\nNow that we’ve recognized the essential nature of the work performed in many of our lowest-paid professions, will we support those workers accordingly with adequate wages and protections against abuse, exploitation and xenophobia?\\n\\nMore specifically, has the anti-racist outrage burning across our country generated enough light to also expose the societal and economic inequities that compel Black, Brown and immigrant workers to literally work themselves to death? Will that outrage generate enough heat to cook up some answers?\\n\\nWill the millions of workers who were set adrift by the virus but buoyed up by accessible unemployment benefits enter voting booths determined to build more lifeboats?\\n\\nWill accommodations such as telework and flexible schedules, often grudgingly granted to comply with disability law, become the curb cuts of the workplace?\\n\\nNow that more of us have an idea what it’s like trying to perform when our traumatized minds and cortisol-saturated bodies refuse to cooperate, can we eliminate stigma against seeking treatment and accommodating mental health needs?\\n\\nNow that many of us have faced the terrible choice between keeping our job and protecting our family — Do I dare go to the office and risk becoming a vector? Do I invite a potentially infectious caretaker into our home, or allow my children to enter someone else’s? Can I afford to school the kids at home? Can I afford not to? — can we agree to make safe, reliable, accessible care systems a priority?\\n\\nNow that many of us have had months to settle into our own most productive rhythms and work habits, can we cultivate patience toward those who gravitate to different schedules and ways of working?\\n\\nNow that many of us have experienced what it’s like having to work and educate future workers through unprecedented turmoil, often relying on neighbors and underfunded systems for support, can we spare a thought for people whose daily lives and educational opportunities have long hampered by chaos and lack of resources, technology, infrastructure, community?\\n\\nFor someone who’s used to coming up with workplace solutions, all I’ve got are questions. But I hope that whatever long-term answers we find in the wake of this national trauma, even if ignited by outrage, will be sustained by empathy.\\n\\nKarla L.

Gretchen Whitmer (D) — bringing new attention to such groups of well-armed men.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAccording to court papers, Null was part of a group that called itself the Wolverine Watchmen, and they engaged in regular firearms training and discussed a variety of potential attacks on law enforcement, the state capital complex, and the governor.\\n\\nLeaf — who knew Null to be the founder of a different group called the Michigan Liberty Militia — said he was generally supportive of self-styled militias, which he said often grow in numbers when people feel their rights are threatened. He sought to distinguish what such groups do from the allegations against Null and the others.\\n\\n“There’s your militia duties, and if they did what they’re accused of doing, those are not militia duties,” said the sheriff, adding he was shocked by the charges. “I did not see this coming. Had I caught wind they were even talking about this, I would have stopped it immediately.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLeaf said he occasionally ran into Null at Second Amendment rallies in the state, and was introduced to his brother, Michael, who was also charged Thursday. The sheriff said William Null “seemed to be a very concerned, straight-shooting guy.” During the Flint water crisis, Leaf said Null told him he drove to Flint to pass out water bottles alongside those involved in the Black Lives Matter movement. He said Null’s group also met with Black Lives Matter supporters at a Grand Rapids protest and “were chasing out the agitators so they could have a peaceful protest.”\\n\\nSince the arrests, Leaf has faced criticism not just for his past public support of Null and his compatriots but also for his suggestion, first made in an interview with a local Fox reporter, that the defendants might have been trying to make a citizen’s arrest of the governor.\\n\\n“The point is that, were they going to arrest her, which they legally can, they can legally make a felony arrest . . . It was just trying to make a point of why we cannot jump to conclusions,” he said, adding later, “If there was ever a regret, that would be the statement, because it does not communicate well.”\\n\\nMichigan’s history of groups like the Wolverine Watchmen has long vexed law enforcement officials.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the more than two decades that Andrew Arena worked as an FBI agent in Michigan before retiring from the Bureau in 2012, “the 64 million dollar question,” he said, “was always: Why Michigan?\\n\\n“We had representatives of every known right-wing, white supremacist, anti-government group out there. And why Michigan, we just could never tell,” said Arena, who now teaches at Western Michigan University’s Thomas M. Cooley Law School. “But obviously you got to deal with it.”\\n\\nMichigan was one of the early strongholds of what was called “the militia movement,” which arose in the 1990s, and has typically manifested as paramilitary groups — often with no more than 10 or 12 members — that oppose the U.S. government, and believe it is actively involved in a conspiracy to seize Americans’ guns and enslave the American people to a new world order.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe state was home to the Michigan Militia, one of the largest groups to form within the movement, and which has since splintered. And more infamously, Michigan was also the plotting ground for Oklahoma City bombers Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, whose anti-government and racist ideology drove their 1995 attack, which left 168 people dead.\\n\\nAcross Michigan, an awareness of extremist groups that call themselves militias — and a shared mistrust of Washington — has for decades been a pervasive theme for many White Michiganders, particularly in the rural swaths of the state outside of metropolitan Detroit, Ann Arbor and Lansing, residents say.\\n\\nThe arrests of this past week have thrown a fresh spotlight on that history and culture. The ideologies and behaviors outlined in court documents, in many ways, are “very similar” to those of the Oklahoma City bombers, Arena said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut experts say a lot has also changed in the extremist landscape since the ’90s, and there has been a proliferation of extremist views fueled by social media, deepening political division, and social grievances.\\n\\nToday’s network of right-wing extremist groups in the United States is vast, and easily confusing. Mark Pitcavage, a senior researcher at the Anti-Defamation League, prefers to group them into two main spheres: white supremacist and anti-government. There is also sometimes overlap, and drawing set definitions of individuals or groups can be misleading.\\n\\n“If you get hung up on the groups, you will greatly underestimate the number of militia-related people in Michigan or anywhere,” Pitcavage said. Social media has made formal membership in a particular group or cause less necessary, he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“You can imbibe an ideology, and network with other people, and even participate in real world events, thanks to the Internet,” he said, and the groups that do exist are often short-lived or constantly changing.\\n\\nThe group that the Null brothers allegedly belonged to, the Wolverine Watchmen, appears to have formed just last year. And the Michigan Militia, formerly one of the most formidable in the national landscape, splintered years ago over divisions on white supremacy. The largest outgrowth of that split currently calls itself the Southeast Michigan Volunteer Militia, Pitcavage said.\\n\\nA movement whose ideology is built on a fundamental mistrust of government broadly embraced President Trump during his run for office in 2015 and 2016, as he seemed to subscribe to many of the same conspiracy theories.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Trump’s transformation from outsider to insider, at the helm of the federal government, has created a conundrum for the groups, Pitcavage said.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/10/13/supreme-court-catholic-women/', 'Full Text': '“I seriously so admire her story” she texted her friend, a fellow Catholic woman, as she watched the Supreme Court nominee’s confirmation hearings this week.\\n\\nStill, Lynch was bothered by the way the judge’s story was being used by politicians.

And she was frustrated that senators continued to bring up Barrett’s large family.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“You just know that if it was a father of 7 up for nomination,” Lynch texted her friend, “they wouldn’t be doing that.”\\n\\nAs Catholic women watched the first two days of Barrett’s confirmation process in the Senate, some saw her as a new kind of “feminist icon,” a woman who raised seven children while pursuing a successful career and prioritizing her faith. Others saw an unrealistic model of what Catholic women are expected to be.\\n\\n“She’s like a new-wave Virgin Mary where you can have it all. You can be a virgin and be a mom. You can be super successful in your career and be a perfect, submissive wife,” said Natalia Imperatori-Lee, a professor of religious studies at Manhattan College in New York. “It’s pedestalizing the impossible.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFive of the last six confirmed Supreme Court justices were raised in the Catholic faith, but Barrett would be the first who is also a mother of school-age children — a point that was repeatedly emphasized by Republican senators during this week’s hearings.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“How do you and your husband manage two full-time professional careers and, at the same time, take care of your large family?” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) asked on Monday. Barrett’s home-state senator, Mike Braun (R-Ind.), called the nominee a “legal titan who drives a minivan.” And in Tuesday’s questioning, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) complimented her “wonderfully well-behaved” children and asked about her family’s decision to adopt two children from Haiti.\\n\\nListening to Cruz “interpret her family’s decision back to her,” Susan B. Reynolds, an assistant professor of Catholic Studies at Emory University, found herself identifying with Barrett, and feeling frustrated by Cruz’s questions. “It was very patronizing,” she said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs a fellow Catholic woman working in academia and a mother of three, Reynolds took exception with the senators asking Barrett, over and over, “how do you do it?”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Nobody actually wants to know how you do it,” she said. “It’s about saying ‘you don’t belong here’ and sometimes, in the case of Judge Barrett, it’s a way of communicating to the American public what kind of woman does belong here.”\\n\\nThe confirmation process, Reynolds said, is depicting an image of what it means to be “an archetypal Catholic woman in America.\"\\n\\nWhile Barrett’s large family has been lauded by politicians, Latina Catholics have long been negatively stereotyped for having many children, said Imperatori-Lee.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“It’s a social burden when it’s a Black or brown family,” Imperatori-Lee said. “If it’s a White family in the Midwest, it’s a beautiful symbol of Catholicism.”\\n\\nFor other, more conservative Catholic women, the focus on Barrett’s family resonated in a personal way. Weeks before her confirmation meeting, Catholic mothers shared photos of their children on Twitter, quoting Barrett: “What greater thing can you do than raise children?”\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I’ve never met her, but she feels like an old friend,” said Caitlin VanOrsdel, 37, of Laytonsville, Md. As a mother of eight, VanOrsdel said she feels like an outlier — even among Catholics today. Barrett’s story “makes me feel justified as a Catholic woman, because she’s someone who was true to her faith, and also has a very successful career. That does speak deeply to me.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShe appreciates the way Barrett gives credit to her husband, saying she relies heavily on him. “I think the feminist movement pits men and women against each other,” said VanOrsdel, who said she typically votes Republican. “I don’t believe that’s the way.”\\n\\nRachel Harkins Ullmann, executive director of the Given Institute, a D.C.-based organization that serves young adult Catholic women across the country, sees Barrett as a modern example of what Pope John Paul II called “a new feminism,” in which women would not have to feel pressured to avoid motherhood.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I felt listening to her that I was listening to my neighbor,” Ullmann said.\\n\\nErin Lynch, the mother in South Bend, was on vacation with her family on Tuesday but insisted on watching the confirmation hearings over breakfast. She was moved by the way Barrett defended herself and her family in the final minutes of her first round of questioning with Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.).\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Look, I’ve made distinct choices,” Barrett said. “I’ve decided to pursue a career and have a large family. I have a multiracial family. Our faith is important to us. All of those things are true. But they are my choices. And in my personal interactions with people, I have a life brimming with people who’ve made different choices and I’ve never tried to impose my choices on them. And the same is true professionally in how I apply the law.”\\n\\nTrump’s campaign hopes her nomination will shore up his support among Catholics, who make up a significant portion of the electorate in several swing states. However, Catholics are as divided politically as the rest of the country, and a wide swath of Catholic women see Barrett’s confirmation as a threat to issues they consider essential to their beliefs, such as health care and immigration.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“What matters to me is not her religion or the extent to which she practices her religion but what she will do on issues,” said Tia Pratt, a sociologist based in Philadelphia and a Black, feminist Catholic. “What’s she’s going to do for voting rights and immigration and health care?”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSister Carol Keehan, a key supporter of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act who was the president of the Catholic Health Association at the time, is particularly concerned about Barrett’s criticism of the logic behind the Supreme Court’s decision to preserve the ACA in her academic writings. Barrett also criticized an ACA provision over birth control. Keehan noted that abortion rates have been on the decline in the past several years since the ACA passed, and Catholic popes have talked about the human need to access adequate health care.\\n\\n“To think about being pregnant and losing your health care, being in the middle of cancer treatment and losing your health care and in the middle of a pandemic,” Keehan said. “It would be unspeakably cruel and devastating.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAlthough she supports Barrett, Lynch also worries about what Barrett’s nomination could mean for issues that align with what she calls her “consistent life ethic.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShe does not support abortion rights, but she also believes that “being pro-life means supporting women and supporting children,” through policies that prioritize child-care subsidies, paid maternity leave, and affordable health care. She works at a nonprofit that helps pregnant women, and she sees how essential these safety nets are to their ability to carry out healthy pregnancies.\\n\\nWhile Lynch said she is grateful that Trump nominated Barrett, she feels it doesn’t “outweigh all of the damage he’s done in the last four years,” particularly his handling of the coronavirus crisis and his treatment of immigrants.\\n\\n“There’s just nothing to me that tells me Donald Trump is pro-life,” she said. “I think it is purely, purely political to him.”\\n\\nShe thinks Trump is hoping his Supreme Court pick will persuade women like her to vote for him, she said.

Under President Trump, though, what has usually been a project for the nation’s bureaucrats took on a decidedly partisan tone.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Supreme Court in 2019 rejected his plans to add a citizenship question to the census form, which experts said would discourage the count of both legal and undocumented immigrants. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote the 5-to-4 decision, saying the administration did not follow proper procedure for introducing the question, and that its rationale was “contrived.”\\n\\nThis summer, the president said he intended to break with the past and present to Congress census data that did not include undocumented immigrants. Two weeks later, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said he was ending the count early — by the end of September — to meet a Dec. 31 deadline.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt is unclear how many Americans are left to be counted. The department said on its website that 99.9 percent of housing units have been accounted for, although others have questioned the figure and said some areas remain undercounted. In a statement Tuesday night, the Census Bureau said the 2020 count will end Thursday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSotomayor said that “even a fraction of a percent of the Nation’s 140 million households amounts to hundreds of thousands of people left uncounted. And significantly, the percentage of nonresponses is likely much higher among marginalized populations and in hard-to-count areas, such as rural and tribal lands.”\\n\\nA panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit had agreed with a district court judge that the Commerce Department could not end the count until Oct. 31. But it also said the department could still try to meet a Dec. 31 deadline for delivering the count to the White House and did not have to wait until April 30 to deliver it, as the district court judge said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat timing is important. The White House wants to send the population totals to Congress in January.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf Trump is not reelected in November, a delay much beyond Dec. 31 would mean that his Democratic opponent, former vice president Joe Biden, would make decisions about the count.\\n\\nPlaintiffs, including the National Urban League, several jurisdictions and other groups, contend that a shortened timeline would result in an undercount of harder-to-count populations, including immigrants, minorities and lower-income groups, depriving them of funding and representation.\\n\\nThose who wanted the count continued said the decision was harmful.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“This decision will result in irreversible damage to the 2020 Census,” said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. “That said, the bureau has indicated that it takes several days to shut down the enumeration process. As we explore options we’ll continue to push undercounted populations in states such as Louisiana and Mississippi to participate while the process remains active.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf there is a “silver lining,” she said, it is that the count continued for two weeks after Ross’s planned conclusion in September.\\n\\nJulie Menin, director of NYC Census 2020, said the census has “been stolen by the Trump administration, which has interfered at every step of the way, and now, the census has been cut short during a global pandemic in which New York City was the epicenter.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSotomayor noted that the Commerce Department itself had once said it needed until Oct. 31 to complete the count. But two weeks after “President Trump announced his intent to exclude undocumented immigrants from the population base for congressional apportionment,” Sotomayor wrote, Ross said the counting would end in September.\\n\\nU.S. District Judge Lucy Koh agreed with challengers that the count should continue. After the 9th Circuit agreed, the Trump administration went to the Supreme Court.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nActing solicitor general Jeffrey B. Wall said the court should not worry that the count is incomplete, saying, “The district court disregarded the Bureau’s successful efforts to ensure that the 2020 census will reach levels of accuracy and completeness comparable to other recent censuses while still meeting the deadline.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCensus experts and plaintiffs have said they are concerned that some households were counted inaccurately to reach the completion-rate goals, citing enumerators and supervisors across the country who said they were told to cut corners and skip steps in the rush to bring all states to a 99 percent completion rate.\\n\\n“As defendants’ own data shows, millions of Americans have now been counted only because of the district court’s injunction,” said the Urban League response to the government suit filed by lawyer Melissa Arbus Sherry. “And critical field work is ongoing, especially for those in hard-to-count populations. Any stay would allow defendants to stop the 2020 Census count, shut down field operations, fire hundreds of thousands of employees, and start processing data the very next day. There is no going back from that.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe census appeared to be on track at the outset of 2020.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut in March, just as survey forms were appearing in people’s mailboxes, the pandemic hit, shutting down the nation and crippling plans for public events around the census, and eventually delaying the start of door-to-door enumeration by three months.\\n\\nThe administration in April requested approval from Congress to move the statutory deadline to deliver census data to the president for House apportionment, from Dec. 31 to April 30. The House approved the change, but the Senate did not act.\\n\\nBy early July, Census Bureau officials were saying the window had closed to be able to deliver an accurate count to the president by year’s end.\\n\\nThen on July 21, Trump issued a memo saying undocumented immigrants would be excluded from census numbers, an action whose effect would be to reduce the number of seats in Congress for states with higher numbers of immigrants, which also would affect their strength in the electoral college for presidential elections.\\n\\nRemoving undocumented immigrants from the count would be unprecedented in U.S. history. But to implement such a change, Trump would need to receive the data while he was still in office.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-trump-seniors-florida/2020/10/13/0a121630-0d71-11eb-8a35-237ef1eb2ef7_story.html', 'Full Text': '“You’re expendable. You’re forgettable. You’re virtually nobody. That’s how he sees seniors,” Biden said in a speech at a community center for seniors in Pembroke Pines, during which he wore a mask the entire time.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe later added, “The only senior that Donald Trump cares about — the only senior — is the senior Donald Trump.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump is hardly conceding the group to the Democratic nominee. His campaign Tuesday debuted a television commercial seeking to make the case that the president is a stronger advocate for seniors’ interests.\\n\\nThe ad suggests that the “far-left health-care plan” embraced by Biden and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) could threaten private insurance. Biden has proposed enacting a public insurance program that would be optional.\\n\\nTrump also made a pitch to seniors at his own rally in Sanford, Fla., on Monday — his first return to the campaign trail after his recent hospitalization — and he filmed a recent video aimed directly at older Americans.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWith three weeks left before the election and early voting already started in many states, a fierce battle is underway for seniors, who turn out in high numbers and hold the potential to swing a close election. Biden and Trump — both septuagenarians — are competing for support from Americans of their own generation at a moment when a pandemic that disproportionately kills older people has upended daily life and voting across the country.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump, 74, was the oldest president at his swearing-in, and Biden, 77, would claim that title if he wins in November. Both are seeking to cast the other as out of touch with the needs of his fellow seniors, and they have questioned each other’s physical and mental preparedness for the job.\\n\\nBut as both candidates stress their own vigor and youthfulness, they have rarely played up the notion that they are senior citizens. Still, Trump has not hesitated to level increasingly personal attacks on Biden’s age.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLate Tuesday night, Trump posted a doctored image on Twitter suggesting Biden belongs in a retirement home. The photo shows seniors seated in wheelchairs; a picture of Biden’s face was pasted onto one of them. The caption underneath read: “Biden for President,” but with the “P” crossed out to spell “Resident.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe power of seniors is especially pronounced in Florida, the largest battleground state, where voters 65 and older made up 21 percent of the electorate in 2016, according to exit poll data. Trump carried Florida seniors by 17 percentage points en route to a slim victory in the state.\\n\\nPolls show Trump’s advantage has eroded sharply this time around, providing a potential opening for Biden to flip a must-win state for the incumbent, as many older Americans are unhappy with Trump’s response to the pandemic and have responded to Biden’s moderate, traditional brand of politics.\\n\\nA September Washington Post-ABC News survey in Florida found Trump with a small advantage over Biden among likely voters 65 and older, 52 percent to 44 percent. A New York Times-Siena College poll in the state found the race between the two even tighter, with 47 percent of Florida seniors for Biden and 45 percent for Trump.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSusan MacManus, an expert on Florida politics and a professor emerita at the University of South Florida, said anecdotal signs suggest the drop in support for Trump among older women has been especially steep. “They don’t like his tone, and I think the debate did a little bit of damage,” she said.\\n\\nOlder voters may not necessarily blame Trump for the pandemic, she added, but many are frustrated with the state of affairs. “They are worried about how all this plays with their kids and grandkids,” McManus said.\\n\\nRecent polls also show a tight race overall in Florida, with Biden scrambling to shore up support among Latino voters, who have been frustrated by the former vice president’s uneven outreach in the state, even as he makes inroads with seniors.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf Biden captures Florida, it would put Trump’s pursuit of an electoral college majority in serious jeopardy. Biden is wagering that Trump’s response to the pandemic, both rhetorically and in his administration’s actions, will help him seal these gains at the ballot box.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHis Tuesday speech reflected the stark contrast Biden is trying to draw, as he made a direct reference to Trump having contracting the coronavirus. Trump tested positive after months of playing down the threat and flouting or dismissing public health recommendations, including making fun of Biden for wearing a mask while rarely doing so himself.\\n\\n“I prayed for his recovery when he got covid,” Biden said of Trump, referring to the disease caused by the virus. “I had hoped at least he’d come out of it somewhat chastened. But what has he done? He’s just doubled down on the misinformation he did before in making it worse.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump has continued to regularly disregard the advice of public health officials calling for Americans to wear masks in public, and he has claimed that he received a “cure” for the virus, a description of his treatment that medical experts reject.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn an apparent reference to Trump’s push to keep the economy from shuttering, Biden added, “So many lives have been lost unnecessarily because this president cares more about the stock market than he does about, you know, the well-being of seniors.”\\n\\nBiden made his pitch personal at points, asking, “How many of you have been unable to hug your grandkids in the last seven months?”\\n\\nHe also pointed to comments that Trump has made saying the virus “affects virtually nobody,” although more than 215,000 people have died and many more have become seriously ill. Trump at the time was arguing that young people had largely been spared and that elderly people with medical conditions are the group it “really affects.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBiden added that Trump’s move to strike down the Affordable Care Act is an affront to seniors, who benefit from the law’s expansion of preventive coverage under Medicare.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump has been making his case in a different way. In contrast to Biden’s carefully prepared speech Tuesday, the president released an unscripted video address on social media last week aimed at seniors.\\n\\n“To my favorite people in the world — the seniors. I’m a senior; I know you don’t know that. Nobody knows that. Maybe you don’t have to tell ’em, but I’m a senior,” Trump said in the video, which he posted on Twitter.\\n\\nHe claimed “tremendous progress” fighting the coronavirus, even as some states hit new seven-day average highs of cases. He vowed to make the treatment he received, and other medications and therapies, available to seniors.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“You’re not vulnerable. But they like to say ‘the vulnerable.’ But you’re the least vulnerable. But for this one thing, you are vulnerable. And so am I,” said Trump, who told seniors they would get the same treatments he got free of charge, though it is not clear how or if he could do that.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump has pushed the Food and Drug Administration to quickly approve coronavirus antibody treatments such as the one he received. But that effort faces an uncertain future, and one of the companies manufacturing a drug Trump used said it would have a very limited supply over the next few months.\\n\\nAt his rally Monday, Trump made another appeal to seniors, arguing that letting in too many immigrants and giving them government benefits would threaten Social Security and Medicare.\\n\\n“We have to take care of our people first. And if they let that happen, you would be decimating Medicare and destroying your Social Security,” Trump said. “While I’m president, no one will touch your Medicare. No one will touch or hurt in any way, shape or form your Social Security.”\\n\\nIn a statement Tuesday, Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh responded to Biden’s comments by accusing him of “playing politics with people’s lives over the virus” and said that “Trump has accomplished more in 47 months than Biden has in 47 years.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/amy-coney-barrett-bush-gore/2020/10/10/594641b8-09e3-11eb-991c-be6ead8c4018_story.html', 'Full Text': 'At issue were thousands of absentee ballot request forms in Martin County — just north of Palm Beach County, home of the notorious “butterfly ballot” — that had missing voter registration information.\\n\\nAfter county officials allowed the GOP to take the forms back and fill in the missing information, a Democratic voter sued, saying ballots cast by those voters should be tossed out.

Kennedy became the first.\\n\\nThe strategy comes as President Trump and his allies have sought to portray Democrats as anti-Catholic, seizing on past criticism from some Democratic senators of the conservative Catholic teachings embraced by Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.\\n\\nBut the focus on Biden’s Catholicism represents a renewed emphasis in identity politics for Democrats, who have directed much of their attention to the role of Black voters but have not always given prominence to the cultural roots of the White former vice president.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat focus was apparent during the recent vice-presidential debate, when Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), hailed for her history-making role as the first woman of Black or Asian ancestry on a major party ticket, noted: “Joe, if elected, will be only the second practicing Catholic” to become president.\\n\\nBiden’s advisers see his faith and cultural touchstones — he famously carries a rosary in his pocket and in his youth had aspired to become a priest — as important ways to connect with what they refer to as the “White working-class Catholic vote” in the industrial Midwestern states. They also hope this will help him among Hispanic Catholics in the Sun Belt.\\n\\n“We’re looking to organize both the Catholics in the pews every Sunday but also the cultural Catholics who were brought up around the church or still align with its social-justice teachings,” said John McCarthy, the Biden campaign’s deputy national political director. “The vice president being who he is allows him to connect. . . . Our best tool for Catholic outreach is Joe Biden.”\\n\\nTrump, a man of little public faith who has assiduously courted evangelical voters, has tried to undercut the political reach of Biden’s beliefs, accusing him of wanting to “hurt the Bible, hurt God.” A top surrogate — former Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz — publicly questioned Biden’s standing in the church, calling him “a Catholic in name only.”\\n\\nHe and other Republicans have also defined criticisms of Supreme Court nominee Barrett by any Democrat — including Biden — as unacceptable attacks on her Catholic faith. Trump has cast himself as a prime defender of Catholicism, even as he denigrates his Catholic opponent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“On the religious situation with Amy, I thought we settled this 60 years ago with the election of John F. Kennedy,” Trump said when he nominated Barrett, exaggerating the Democratic response to her so far, which has mostly centered on whether she would vote against the Affordable Care Act. “But seriously, they’re going after her Catholicism. I will stand with her, fight with her, and we will make sure that these attacks stop.”\\n\\nBiden on Monday said Barrett’s religious background should be off-limits in any questioning during confirmation hearings. “No, I don’t think there should be any questions about her faith,” he told reporters before traveling to Toledo, an area with 124 parishes.\\n\\nBiden’s move to accent his Catholic background seeks to avoid defining his faith solely through the lens of abortion rights, which he supports, and will test whether Catholic voters share his perspective. For Biden, abortion rights have already proved to be a central and divisive topic, as it has with other high-ranking Catholic politicians; however, a 2019 Pew Research Center survey found that 56 percent of Catholics support the right to abortion in all or most cases.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDemocrats have long claimed that he was not supportive enough of abortion rights — he came out in support of federal funding for abortions only last year — and Republicans have criticized him for deviating from the church’s opposition to abortion. Some U.S. bishops have denied Biden Communion because of his stance, and Catholic schools have not allowed him to speak.\\n\\nWhen Biden was selected in 2016 to receive one of highest honors that Notre Dame can confer on an American Catholic, it triggered an uproar among some on the campus who were angry about his stance on abortion rights.\\n\\nA group of faculty members, the University Faculty for Life, called it “a scandalous violation of the University’s moral responsibility.” By a unanimous vote, the group called on the university to rescind the honor to Biden; the university resisted and conferred the award.\\n\\nBarrett was a member of the group, but a White House official and three other faculty members in the group at the time told The Washington Post that she had no role in drafting the resolution and was not present when the vote was taken.\\n\\nBiden, the country’s first Catholic vice president, has rarely mentioned Barrett by name and hasn’t brought up their shared Catholic faith. Biden’s campaign has spread the word among its surrogates to avoid any mention of Barrett’s religious views, sticking to discussions of how she might rule.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“We’re not the campaign that attacks people’s faith. We talk about our values,” said Josh Dickson, a former Republican who is Biden’s faith outreach director. “Around Amy Coney Barrett, it’s fair to look at her record. But our focus is on Donald Trump. Donald Trump is on the ballot, and how he has acted and failed to lead are important to people of faith.”\\n\\nCatholics make up about one-fifth of the population but are concentrated in key electoral pockets. The industrial Midwest is filled with older Catholics, many of whom grew up in the traditional blue-collar families that helped deliver states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin to Trump in 2016. Hispanic Catholics — a growing demographic, both in the church and in politics — are concentrated in important Sun Belt states such as Arizona and Florida.\\n\\nOnly 14 percent of Catholic voters said it was important to have a president who shared their religious beliefs, but 62 percent of Catholics said it was very important to have a president who lives a moral and ethical life, according to a February survey by the Pew Research Center.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCatholics who are registered to vote are almost evenly divided between the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, according to Pew Research Center polls. While Hispanic Catholics overwhelmingly lean toward Democrats, the past decade has seen a steady erosion of the number of White Catholics who support the party.\\n\\nIn 2008, when Biden was Barack Obama’s running mate, the Democratic ticket won Catholics, 54 percent to 45 percent, according to exit polls. But in the 2012 reelection campaign, Catholics were evenly split.\\n\\nThe transformation continued in 2016, when 52 percent of Catholics supported Trump, compared with 45 percent for Hillary Clinton, according to a Pew Research Center survey.\\n\\n“There has been a growing realization that the Catholic vote in 2016 was an influencer in the outcome of that election,” said Mark J. Rozell, who co-edited the book “Catholics and US Politics After the 2016 Elections: Understanding the ‘Swing Vote.’ ” “And one of the keys in this election is the ability of Joe Biden to undercut some of Trump’s support among White Catholics.”\\n\\nThe Trump campaign launched a Catholics for Trump group in April and has coordinators in key states such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. His campaign has pointed to Biden’s support for abortion rights as a reason for practicing Catholics to be wary of him. Trump’s campaign has run digital ads touting support from Catholics, and an outside group, CatholicVote, last month launched a nearly $10 million advertising campaign opposing Biden.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Over nearly 50 years in office, Joe Biden has enacted policies that drastically undermine Americans’ ability to live out their faith in their everyday lives,” said Samantha Zager, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign.\\n\\n“President Trump is the most pro-life president in history, a staunch defender of religious liberties, and has a strong track record of appointing conservative judges to the federal bench,” she said. “Biden won’t even announce his Supreme Court list because he knows it would alienate Americans of faith, and his last-ditch attempts to win over religious voters are disingenuous and transparently political.”\\n\\nTrump’s attraction to Catholics and other religious voters can seem quizzical on the surface. He rarely goes to church and has said he can’t ever remember asking God for forgiveness. He has downplayed the importance of Communion, flippantly saying during his 2016 campaign: “I drink the little wine, which is about the only wine I drink, and I eat the little cracker.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut he has also reveled in the embrace of evangelicals in what has been a largely transactional relationship. Many have brushed aside his behavior as they confer approval for his policies, especially the judicial appointments that have made the federal bench more conservative.\\n\\nTrump’s focus on abortion as defining how to appeal to Catholics chooses one aspect of church teaching that conforms to his current worldview — even as many of his other policies are in direct opposition to church positions. Among them: his support for capital punishment, which Biden opposes, and his treatment of immigrants. (Trump in the past had described himself as favoring abortion rights, changing his position a few years before running for president.)\\n\\n“Being Catholic, trying to align yourself with the Catholic Church when it comes to politics — it’s complicated,” said Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who went through 13 years of Catholic schooling. “You have a lot of Catholics who are pro-life saying we’re going to burn in hell because we’re pro-choice.”\\n\\n“But the Church has a clear position on immigration reform,” he added. “You don’t hear a lot of Democrats telling Republicans they’re going to hell for not being for immigration reform or not doing more social programs for the poor.”\\n\\nJust as Biden’s reputation as a moderate dealmaker has complicated Trump’s attempts to cast him as a radical socialist, the former vice president’s lifelong faith has made it hard to portray him as a secular adversary.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBiden allies have grown angry over Trump’s suggestions that Biden is “an enemy of God,” to the point that New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) recently revealed a story that he said reflected Biden’s deep reverence.\\n\\nOn a trip to Germany in 2013 that came at the prodding of Murphy, then the U.S. ambassador to the country, Biden said he had only one favor to ask: Could the ambassador find an English-speaking priest to say Mass for Biden and his family? Murphy located a priest, and about 10 people gathered in a hotel room for the service.\\n\\n“For the Catholics like me, the notion you’d be traveling on a regular Sunday and go to those lengths, it’s a measure of a guy’s true faith,” Murphy said. “It’s a quiet faith. It’s a genuine faith. He’s not wearing it on his sleeve. Which makes it, in my opinion, even more impressive.”\\n\\nMurphy said he had kept the moment private until recently, when he grew tired of what he views as unfair attacks on Biden by defenders of Barrett.\\n\\n“Just as her faith shouldn’t be dragged into it, his shouldn’t either,” he said. “You can’t have it both ways. That’s what these guys do. It’s hypocritical to treat one person and their faith one way and another person and their faith another.”\\n\\nCatholics for Biden, part of the campaign’s outreach, lists a number of church priorities on its website, including dignity for workers, access to health care and a “humane” immigration policy. The group has been hosting virtual events and phone banking, calling other Catholics to spread Biden’s story and emphasize their shared faith.\\n\\n“The more we make this personal and real, the more we can talk about who Joe is, how he lives his faith, the more folks get to know him,” said Felice Gorordo, national co-chair of Catholics for Biden.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/columbus-day-italy/2020/10/11/cc774eaa-0a44-11eb-8719-0df159d14794_story.html', 'Full Text': '“Columbus represents genocide,” protesters wrote in Richmond after throwing a Columbus statue into a lake. In Italy, that’s just not the case.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe disconnect might have to do with a lack of knowledge among Italians about the more objectionable aspects of Columbus’s life and legacy. But scholars say there’s also a national defensiveness that has gotten in the way of further understanding.\\n\\nItalians hear little that is critical of Columbus in school. A 2019 high school textbook, “History and Forgotten Stories,” says only: “Columbus exhibited unquestionable skills as a navigator, but wasn’t able to govern the new territories. Thus began the decline of his mythos and of his authority.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGiuseppe Marcocci, professor in Iberian history at the University of Oxford, said: “Italian school textbooks still present a clear divide between Columbus the discoverer and the subsequent arrival of Cortez the [Spanish] conqueror. In reality, the two processes are intimately intertwined.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEurope’s former colonial powers have increasingly begun to reckon with the brutality of that historical period. Indeed, when the United States’ Black Lives Matter protests spread to European cities, the chants were about both modern-day discrimination and colonial legacies. But Columbus — who sailed for Spain and served as governor of Hispaniola — has so far largely escaped a reassessment in Italy.\\n\\n“Some vague awareness of his colonialist brutality has only in the last few years made it into classrooms,” said Marina Nezi, a recently retired high school history teacher in Rome. “But [Italy has] a very long history, and school years are often not enough to tell the whole of it.”\\n\\nThe idealized version of Columbus is crystallized in Italy’s most famous encyclopedia, which defines him as a “great navigator, discoverer of America.” When older Italians think of Columbus, they may visualize Gabriel Byrne’s solemn, silver-haired portrayal in a mid-’80s Italian American TV production.\\n\\nThe historic Columbus is accused of introducing or allowing for systematic slavery in the Caribbean. Historians say he owned enslaved people himself while ruling Hispaniola and transported at least two groups of enslaved people to Spain.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“What is clear is that the colonial society under Columbus is violent from the get-go,” Marcocci said, “and people can conceive of abusing, caging, torturing and mutilating the local population.”\\n\\nTo be sure, the United States held an almost universally romantic view of Columbus until sometime after the celebration of his voyage’s 500th anniversary. Then people started looking into the unsavory parts of his past.\\n\\n“In 1992 America, [Columbus’s reputation] was still immaculate. Thirty years later, it’s a whole other era. The current Italian attitude is still stuck at that time,” said Giulio Busi, author of “Christopher Columbus, the Sailor of Secrets.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBusi suggested that Italians have resisted their own reassessment, because they’ve taken U.S. criticism of Columbus personally.\\n\\n“There’s a firewall of Italianness that has prevented the critique from breaking through and garnering a meaningful following,” Busi said. Toppling his statues “feels like an attack on our nationality.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis summer, a national newspaper publicized a campaign to collect signatures: #HandsOffColumbus. Facebook groups were formed.\\n\\n“More than 500 years after his death [Columbus] has to suffer new insults,” Francesco Giubilei and Marco Valle wrote in the newspaper, Il Giornale, in July. “Thinking that by destroying his statues and eradicating his memory one may solve [U.S. society’s racial tensions] is hypocritical and wrong.”\\n\\nAndrea Castanini, deputy editor of Genoa’s Il Secolo XIX daily, said his newspaper has published several pieces about the attacks on Columbus statues in the United States, with Italians voicing their dissent. “He’s a local hero, and residents were defending him, for what that’s worth. They are very proud of him,” Castanini said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMen like Columbus, wrote Gabriella Airaldi in one such appeal, “have contributed to building our identity. By destroying [them] you ultimately harm yourself.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nItalian right-wing politicians, too, have been calling out for the safeguard of the national hero’s monuments in the United States.\\n\\nResponding to the removal of a statue in Columbus, Ohio — a onetime gift from Genoa — Giorgia Meloni, leader of the Brothers of Italy party, called the sailor “a great Italian” and proposed: “Let’s get it back and display it in one of our beautiful squares . . . lest it lies abandoned in some warehouse.”\\n\\n“Against Columbus, like ISIS. Shame on you,” Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right League party, wrote on Facebook, comparing Black Lives Matter protesters to “Islamic terrorists.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nColumbus has played a role in identity formation on both sides of the Atlantic.\\n\\nIn the United States, the idea of Columbus Day was promoted by Italian immigrants trying to project a sense of belonging in the face of sometimes violent xenophobia.\\n\\n“Columbus becomes this figure that Italians latch on to as a way to get a foothold in this incredibly hostile environment that they find themselves in,” Joseph Sciorra, of Queens College’s Italian American Institute, told NPR.\\n\\nIn Italy, the mythology of Columbus was used to help hold a young nation together. It was politics, not science, that turned a man who lived in a time when Italy didn’t even exist, and would only ever write in Spanish, into a lasting symbol of national pride.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe stark white monument in front of Genoa’s railway station was dedicated in 1862, just one year after Italian unity was attained. It speaks the language of patriotic propaganda. The explorer leans on an anchor with an Indigenous woman sitting meekly at his right. The inscription reads, “To Christopher Columbus, the Fatherland.”\\n\\nThe barely formed Italian state required Romantic heroes, and Columbus fit that bill because of what his real accomplishments had been.\\n\\n“After him, the ocean was no longer labeled ‘dark and mysterious,’ ” says Franco Farinelli, geographer at the University of Bologna.\\n\\n“People already knew the world was spherical. But Columbus was the first to translate that into a map, finding the shortest route and actually risking [his life] to follow it. It’s a pillar of Western, performative thought. He invented the New World, but, of course, he did it for a conquest-oriented entrepreneurial operation.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDuring his seven years as governor of Hispaniola, the island now shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the colony was ruled with a ruthlessness that was unfortunately common for the time.\\n\\n“Establishing the specific individual responsibilities of Columbus is tough,” Marcocci said, but within 25 years of his arrival, most of the native Taíno population had died of enslavement, massacre or disease.\\n\\nMore broadly, Columbus is blamed for opening the floodgates to European colonization — an indictment that some academics say is shaky at best.'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/bernard-cohen-lawyer-who-won-victory-for-interracial-marriage-in-loving-v-virginia-dies-at-86/2020/10/13/82506128-0d4f-11eb-8074-0e943a91bf08_story.html', 'Full Text': 'Richard Loving and Mildred Loving, who was of African American and American Indian heritage, became the protagonists in a legal battle that ended with a ruling striking down anti-miscegenation laws — “the last de jure vestige of racism” in the United States, as Mr. Cohen later described them. Less than seven years out of law school, he was one of two lawyers to argue their case before the Supreme Court, shaping an argument that would reverberate for decades in that chamber and beyond.\\n\\nMr. Cohen, who later became a prominent liberal member of the Virginia House of Delegates, died Oct. 12 at an assisted-living facility in Fredericksburg, Va. He was 86. The cause was Parkinson’s disease, according to his family.\\n\\nMr. Cohen joking described himself as “an old man of 29” when he first met the Lovings, a couple from Caroline County, roughly midway between Fredericksburg and Richmond, where both had grown up. Richard, a bricklayer, was 24 when they married in 1958. Mildred, six years his junior, was pregnant with the first of their three children.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nProhibited by the Racial Integrity Act of 1924 from marrying in Virginia, the couple were wed in D.C. on June 2, 1958. Weeks later, after their return to Virginia, local authorities forcibly entered their home at 2 a.m., shining flashlights in their eyes.\\n\\n“They asked Richard who was that woman he was sleeping with, and I said, ‘I’m his wife,’ ” Mildred Loving later recalled, according to an account in Washingtonian magazine.\\n\\n“Not here you’re not,” the sheriff replied.\\n\\nThe Lovings were arrested, pleaded guilty to violating the Racial Integrity Act and avoided a one-year jail term by consenting to leave Virginia and not reenter the state for 25 years. They settled in the District but, far from their families and friends, were unhappy there. When one of their sons was hit by a car, Mildred Loving decided that they had to leave the city.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“He was sitting up in the street crying,” she said. “And I think that was the straw that broke the camel’s back. I had to get out of there.”\\n\\nThe couple wrote to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, asking if he might assist them. He referred them to the American Civil Liberties Union, which in turn connected them with Mr. Cohen, one of the organization’s volunteer lawyers. He practiced in Alexandria, Va., but met the couple in Washington, to avoid making them enter Virginia.\\n\\n“I knew it was going to be a landmark case,” Mr. Cohen told the Associated Press in 1992. “I knew it was going to the Supreme Court. And I definitely thought there was something serendipitous about the fact that the case would be called Loving vs. the Commonwealth of Virginia.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe said that the Lovings, who were described in news accounts as deeply private people, were shocked by his assessment of the importance of their case.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBecause they had pleaded guilty, Mr. Cohen had to overcome procedural challenges to return the case to court in Virginia, where a judge ruled that “Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. And but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.”\\n\\nWorking with a co-counsel, Philip J. Hirschkop, Mr. Cohen filed a federal class-action suit, which on April 10, 1967, reached the Supreme Court. Mr. Cohen received some “nasty phone calls at home” and “experienced some freezing-out by some of my colleagues who wanted to keep their distance,” he told The Washington Post, in the course of the case.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTheir argument hinged on two fundamental constitutional concepts, the guarantees of equal protection and due process.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut “no matter how we articulate this, no matter which theory of the Due Process Clause,” Mr. Cohen argued before the justices, “no one can articulate it better than Richard Loving when he said to me, ‘Mr. Cohen, tell the Court I love my wife and it is just unfair that I can’t live with her in Virginia.’ ”\\n\\nOn June 12, 1967, the Court unanimously ruled that the state could no longer prohibit mixed-race marriages, with Chief Justice Earl Warren condemning laws such as Virginia’s anti-miscegenation statute as “odious to a free people.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMr. Cohen said that when the lawyers called the Lovings to inform them of the decision, the couple asked, “Well, what do we do now?”\\n\\n“We said, you just go on living,” he told NPR in 2007. “Nobody’s going to bother you anymore over this.”\\n\\nThe son of Jewish immigrants, Bernard Sol Cohen was born in Brooklyn on Jan. 17, 1934.

He served in the House of Delegates from 1980 until 1996, representing a section of Alexandria.\\n\\nDescribed by The Post as “more unabashedly liberal than the typical Virginia Democrat,” Mr. Cohen was best known in the state Capitol for his successful efforts to impose restrictions on indoor smoking — over powerful pressure from the tobacco lobby — and for his work on measures strengthening the rights of terminally ill patients to decline certain life-prolonging treatments.\\n\\nSurvivors include his wife of 61 years, the former Rae Rose, of Spotsylvania, Va.; two children, Bennett Cohen of Centreville, Va., and Karen Cohen of Haymarket, Va.; and three grandchildren.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMr. Cohen represented Mildred Loving a second time when she filed a lawsuit stemming from her husband’s death in 1975 in an automobile accident involving a drunk driver, and he was present at her home when she died in 2008.\\n\\nThe Lovings and their ordeal were dramatized in films including the 2016 movie “Loving” by director Jeff Nichols, in which actor Nick Kroll portrayed Mr. Cohen. The case had been revived in the public consciousness a year earlier, when Loving v. Virginia was cited as precedent in the 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges legalizing same-sex marriage.\\n\\n“The decision in Loving brought enough to encompass the principle involved in the same-sex marriage case,” Mr. Cohen told the Richmond Times Dispatch. “Because the constitutional principle involved is the same, the right to marry is a constitutionally protected right of liberty.

It seemed to be her way of answering an outcry of concern over the safety of the residence staff. This first lady with what can at times seem like an antagonistic relationship with the press, who rarely gives interviews or deviates from her prepared remarks at public appearances, was following her own playbook.\\n\\n“It’s extraordinary in history, and it’s a direct contradiction to the way in which he is behaving,” says Myra Gutin, a professor at Rider University and author of “The President’s Partner: The First Lady in the Twentieth Century.” Gutin says she cannot think of any other first lady who’s released a separate statement from her own office so diametrically opposed to the president’s messaging — and with an election less than 30 days away.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“She very well may be responding to criticism of running a lax ship there at the White House based on her husband’s activities, and she wants to say, ‘No, no, no,’ ” says Katherine Jellison, a professor of history at Ohio University who has studied first ladies. “The criticism isn’t just from the press, but the general public. I mean, my social media feed is all about the Trumps and their inner circle acting like modern-day Typhoid Marys.”\\n\\nA coronavirus quarantine was an excuse for the first lady to lie low, as seems to be her preference, and shrug off appearances for a campaign that is faltering among women and could benefit from her relatively higher popularity than the president’s. And yet, here she was, calling attention to her contrast with her husband, even as they were literally stuck together under the same roof. (He has since left quarantine to work in the Oval Office and resume campaigning).\\n\\n“My guess is that she’s looking out for her own reputation and trying to distance herself from her husband’s apparently cavalier attitude toward safety precautions,” says Jellison.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBefore the pandemic, “distancing” in Washington simply meant rhetorically backing away from some politically toxic figure or behavior. During the covid-19 pandemic, the first lady has made efforts to signal that she takes public-health guidelines seriously even if her husband doesn’t.\\n\\nThis could be seen as distancing, in the traditional sense: the first lady creating some daylight between herself and the president for the sake of her own reputation. Just as easily, it could be an example of Melania Trump using her public persona to project that there is someone sensible in the Trump White House as her husband seeks a second term.\\n\\n“The health of Residence staff members and their families are a paramount concern to the First Family,” the statement from her office read. It talked about the mask mandate the first lady implemented for residence staff in April and how her office had hired a “well-being” consultant to help maintain the mental health of the folks who vacuum the halls and do the president’s laundry. The president is only mentioned in the statement once, in the final paragraph about how staff were now wearing full personal protective equipment around him (yellow gowns, surgical masks, face shields, as the New York Times reported).\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNotably, the statement from the first lady’s office says nothing about people interacting with the residence staff having to wear masks to protect them in return.\\n\\nIt wasn’t the first time since the president and first lady tested positive for the coronavirus that she has come across as the responsible one. The president took an unnecessary ride in an SUV to wave to supporters outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, to aghast reactions from doctors about the risk to the Secret Service agents trapped in the car with an active coronavirus patient. Meanwhile, it came out that the first lady had chosen not to visit the president in the hospital, “because that would expose the agents who would drive her there,” an unnamed White House official told NBC News.\\n\\nThroughout the pandemic, Melania Trump has repeatedly been better at messaging about covid-19 than the president. She was the first member of the Trump family to wear a mask in public, and she filmed a PSA about mask-wearing on the same day Trump said at a news briefing, “I just don’t want to wear one.” Her social media feeds have been a constant parade of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance, and she’s put it into practice, encouraging teleworking and mandating staffers wear masks in her offices in the East Wing, according to Stephanie Grisham, the first lady’s press secretary.\\n\\nOn her last solo appearance, a Sept. 17 trip to visit a New Hampshire hospital that has a cuddling program to soothe babies born with opioid addiction, she wore a mask and required that her press pool and everyone in proximity to her wear masks and have been tested for the coronavirus.\\n\\nThe first lady's efforts to tout her responsibility to White House staff also has allowed her to distance herself from a news story that could threaten her reputation by making her seem more like her husband.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe night before the president made her test results public along with his own, CNN’s Anderson Cooper played tapes of her private conversations with former close friend and senior adviser Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, filled with vulgar language and what many have seen as callous, dismissive remarks about migrant families being separated at the border. (“Give me a f---ing break,” she said in a mocking tone, regarding the media constantly asking her about her husband’s immigration policies.) She even savaged Christmas, a holiday her husband regularly highlighted on the campaign trail, saying that liberals were trying to kill it.\\n\\n“Who gives a f--- about Christmas?” Melania Trump asked on the tapes, expressing disdain for the traditional first lady duty of overseeing the White House Christmas decorations. (Although, to be fair, she mostly seemed to be upset about “working . . . my a-- off” to decorate the White House only to be criticized for her choices as if they were a major affront to the nation.)\\n\\nMore shocking were her comments that children detained away from their parents were happy because they had a bed and “a cabinet for my clothes” and that was better than what they’d had in the Central American countries they were fleeing. She also said that “moms and kids” who claim they are fleeing from gang violence were “teached how to do it.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWinston Wolkoff was on CNN to promote her tell-all, “Melania & Me,” released in September, about her friendship with the first lady and its demise after she says she was “thrown under the bus” in a scandal relating to Trump’s $107 million inauguration.\\n\\n“People need to know who she really is and that she is just like him,” Winston Wolkoff told The Washington Post about her motivations for releasing the recordings. “There is no yin and yang. They are one and the same.”\\n\\nGrisham, the first lady’s press secretary, issued a fiery rebuke, telling The Post that she had no way of knowing if the tapes were edited: The former White House volunteer’s “only intent,” said Grisham, “was to secretly tape the first lady in order to peddle herself and her salacious book.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Winston Wolkoff wasn’t done. On Monday — the day before the first lady’s statement about the residence staff — Winston Wolkoff played more tapes on the “Mea Culpa” podcast hosted by Trump’s former attorney, Michael Cohen, who went to jail for lying to investigators about paying hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels for an affair she’d had with Trump. On one of them, the first lady refers to Stormy as “the porn hooker.” Porn actresses took to Twitter and accused her of shaming sex workers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe tapes are a rare window into how this press-shy, meticulously scripted first lady really thinks and speaks. “She’s very fond of the f-word, which might be a first for first ladies,” says Jellison.\\n\\nThey also run against her image as the responsible Trump who is not like the others. To judge by Winston Wolkoff’s tapes, there might not be much distance at all between the first lady and the president.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor all of her tweets about CDC regulations, she has also been inexplicably inconsistent, sometimes showing up to public appearances at the president’s side without a mask and sometimes being the only person boarding Air Force One with one. At the first debate, she joined the rest of the Trump family in taking off her mask, even as staff of the Cleveland Clinic tried to hand them some.\\n\\nAfter the debate a maskless Melania Trump congratulated the president onstage; a little over 12 feet away, Jill Biden conspicuously wore hers. It’s one of the last images most people have of the first lady before her diagnosis. Another is her, maskless again, clapping for Amy Coney Barrett at a Rose Garden event celebrating Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court — an event that would soon be linked to a coronavirus outbreak among Republicans in attendance.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“If she genuinely believed that wearing a mask would save lives, she would have always had one,” says Winston Wolkoff. “The reality is she does believe what he thinks on 95 percent of things. They do believe they’re untouchable.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe White House has assiduously dodged questions about when President Trump last tested negative for the coronavirus, making it difficult for the public to deduce how and when he and first lady might have contracted the virus and whom they might have transmitted it to before their diagnoses. A White House spokesman last week told reporters that how the virus got into the White House was “sort of an unknowable question” (though at least one former CDC official begged to differ) and that the focus now was on preventing further transmission.\\n\\nBut reporters have since revealed that members of the residence staff had taken ill long before the first lady’s diagnosis prompted questions about their safety. Four residence staffers tested positive for the coronavirus about three weeks ago: three housekeepers and an assistant to the chief usher, Timothy Harleth. Not only did Harleth ask the staff to “use discretion” about the positive cases, he told the first family about the cases, the New York Times reported. The White House kept it under wraps and also did not disclose that the head of security, Crede Bailey, is “gravely ill” with covid-19 and was taken to the hospital in late September, as reported by Bloomberg News last week.\"}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/harris-supreme-court-barrett/2020/10/10/ed1e4e1c-0a47-11eb-a166-dc429b380d10_story.html', 'Full Text': 'She also pushed him on whether he had discussed the Mueller investigation with anyone at a law firm linked to President Trump — adding ominously, “Be sure about your answer, sir.” Kavanaugh appeared mystified and ultimately said no, leaving Republicans furious and Democrats unsure what Harris was getting at.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThose moments illustrate the power Harris’s prosecutorial skills have to energize Democrats and elevate her profile, but also the risk for controversy she faces in high-profile hearings like these.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStarting Monday, Harris will again be at the center of an explosive nomination battle — this time in an unprecedented role as a member of a presidential ticket participating in a divisive Supreme Court hearing just three weeks before Election Day.\\n\\nAs Joe Biden’s running mate, she faces an especially delicate task: appearing tough enough to satisfy liberals upset with Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination but restrained enough to support Biden’s outreach to disillusioned Republicans.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt the same time, she is auditioning as a possible future president. “If I were Kamala Harris, I would try to [give] off the most presidential demeanor possible,” said Mike Davis, a Republican Judiciary Committee counsel during the Kavanaugh hearings. “Her job is to be presidential.”\\n\\nHarris’s aides say she will leave the campaign trail this week to focus fully on the hearing. Despite her national profile, Harris will be among the Judiciary Committee’s most junior members at a potentially raucous proceeding where everyone will be masked, several senators facing reelection will need to score points and some members are expected to participate remotely because of coronavirus infections.\\n\\nIn many ways, the stakes are higher this time. Barrett’s confirmation would create a 6-to-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court, an outcome Democrats warn would threaten abortion rights, the Affordable Care Act, LGBTQ protections and more.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTwo years ago, Harris faced a different challenge as one of several Democrats on the Judiciary Committee contemplating a 2020 presidential run, including Sens. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Cory Booker (N.J.). Harris became a face of the Democrats’ resistance to Kavanaugh, especially after she asked whether he knew of any laws that dictate a man’s use of his body.\\n\\nKavanaugh appeared stumped. “I’m happy to answer a more specific question, but . . .” he trailed off. Harris prodded: “Male versus female?” After more back-and-forth, Kavanaugh conceded, “I’m not thinking of any right now, senator.”\\n\\nThe second inquiry was whether Kavanaugh had spoken about the then-pending Mueller investigation to any member of the Kasowitz Benson and Torres law firm, whose co-founder Marc Kasowitz had represented Trump.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKavanaugh, appearing uncertain what Harris was getting at, initially stumbled over his answer but ultimately said no. A Harris spokeswoman at the time said the senator had reason to believe Kavanaugh had ties to the firm, though she did not provide details.\\n\\nRepublicans said angrily that Harris had overstepped, fabricating a nonexistent “gotcha,” and Trump continues to blame Harris for what he calls the “suffering” Kavanaugh endured at the hearing.\\n\\n“Sen. Kamala Harris was the one who grilled then-Judge Kavanaugh on a wild conspiracy theory that he was colluding with a lawyer at a law firm regarding the Mueller probe,” said Davis, the former judiciary counsel. “It was completely baseless, and she knows it was completely baseless.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKavanaugh has not been Harris’s only target. In May 2019, Attorney General William P. Barr appeared before the Judiciary Committee, and Harris asked whether Trump — or anyone else at the White House — had ever suggested he open an investigation of someone.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBarr hesitated, saying, “I wouldn’t . . .” then asked her to repeat the question. As he searched for an answer, Harris said pointedly, “Seems you’d remember something like that.”\\n\\nUltimately, Barr said he could not answer the question, and Democrats cheered the exchange as revealing potential ethical concerns and what they considered Barr’s inappropriate closeness with the White House.\\n\\nBut Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), a close Biden ally, said Harris’s prosecutorial reputation overshadows a broader, less polarizing role that she plays in less noticed Judiciary Committee hearings.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“The world off the committee really only pays attention to the committee when there’s a high-profile fight,” Coons said, but “you have hearings on things as diverse as antitrust, intellectual property, immigration, gun violence and judicial nominees.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe added, “Sen. Harris is someone who always does her homework. She’s prepared. She’s thorough. And she’s often one or two steps ahead of the witness.”\\n\\nHarris also sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which holds many of its hearings behind closed doors, a setting that tends to minimize performative partisan posturing. Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the committee’s top Democrat, said Harris has won her colleagues’ respect in those closed sessions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“People don’t stand for grandstanding, and there’s also some good-natured back-and-forth — more than you’d see in a public setting,” Warner said. “But she came in tough and earned her stripes right away. Even very conservative Republicans realized she did her homework and knew her stuff.”\\n\\nWarner and Coons noted that Harris, whose election to the Senate in 2016 makes her one of its most junior members, is for that reason among the last to ask questions at any committee hearing.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“One of the challenges of being a junior member of the committee, as I remember from a decade ago, is often by the time it gets to you, three-quarters of what you wanted to ask has already been asked,” Coons said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAides say Harris often prepares a handful of potential inquiries, then crosses off questions and recalibrates as her colleagues cover that ground. Often, aides say, Harris ends up posing queries she has thought of or reframed during the hearing itself.\\n\\nBefore most consequential hearings, Harris’s staff prepares briefing binders, often prompting her to ask for more information. Once she has it, she and her staffers bat around potential lines of questioning.\\n\\nHarris’s former chief of staff, Nathan Barankin, remembers Harris before the Kavanaugh hearing, sitting in a room full of aides — “rocket-scientist lawyers who went to Harvard, Yale and practiced before the U.S. Supreme Court”— as they strategized about how best to interrogate the nominee.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHarris at one point halted the discussion. “Can anyone here name for me another Supreme Court case that dictates to a man what he may or may not do to his body?” Barankin remembers her asking. Nobody could think of one, and that led to Harris’s pointed question to Kavanaugh.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the Barrett nomination, Harris has been more willing than Biden to warn it could imperil reproductive rights if Barrett joins a majority to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision guaranteeing abortion rights.\\n\\nBut Harris and Biden have sounded louder alarms about the threat to the Affordable Care Act, whose constitutionality will come before the Supreme Court shortly after the election.\\n\\nThat could be a focus of Harris’s questioning at the upcoming hearing, aides say, adding that Senate Democratic leaders will largely determine their party’s strategy. “I don’t expect any input from the Biden campaign,” Coons said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThose familiar with early plans say, given Harris’s high profile, she will probably try to hammer home a big-picture message rather than focusing on details.\\n\\nShe has already rejected accusations from Republicans who charge that Democrats have shown an anti-Catholic bias against Barrett — an assertion made by Vice President Pence at the recent vice-presidential debate.\\n\\n“Joe Biden and I are both people of faith, and it’s insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith,” Harris responded. “In fact, Joe, if elected, will be only the second practicing Catholic as president of the United States.”'}, {'url': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/melania-book-lawsuit/2020/10/13/a06398f8-0d98-11eb-8a35-237ef1eb2ef7_story.html', 'Full Text': 'In a statement, Wolkoff said she fulfilled the agreement and that its confidentiality provisions ended when the White House terminated it. “The President and First Lady’s use of the US Department of Justice to silence me is a violation of my First Amendment Rights and a blatant abuse of the government to pursue their own personal interests and goals,” Winston Wolkoff said, adding, “I will not be deterred by these bullying tactics.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWinston Wolkoff, 50, had a \\xad15-year friendship with Melania Trump before she was ousted in 2018 as an unpaid senior adviser to the first lady in a scandal involving President Trump’s $107 million inauguration.

Some suggest celebrating only with others who are already living under the same roof.

But Canada’s numbers are moving in the wrong direction, reversing gains made in the late spring and early summer. Officials worry the worst is yet to come as winter approaches, bringing with it flu season and temperatures that force more people indoors.\\n\\nThe country reported an average of 2,052 new daily cases over the previous seven days on Thursday, up 30 percent from the week before, according to Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer. Daily case counts in some provinces have eclipsed the records set in the spring, when tougher restrictions were in place. Hospitalizations are up.\\n\\nInfectious-diseases specialists see several reasons for the surge: Large social gatherings; the reopening of bars and restaurants; the failure of officials to take advantage of a summer of comparatively few cases to prepare for a fall wave; and pandemic fatigue.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“My fear here is that we’re going to have a really dark fall and winter if we don’t act,” said University of Toronto professor Andrew Morris, an infectious-diseases specialist at the Mount Sinai Hospital and University Health Network.\\n\\nAs in Europe, provinces are shying away from reimposing the broad business closures and stay-at-home orders of the spring, opting instead for targeted local measures that officials hope will inflict less damage on their economies.\\n\\nQuebec has gone the furthest. Its three hardest-hit areas — Montreal, Quebec City and parts of the southeastern Chaudière-Appalaches region — entered a 28-day partial lockdown on Oct. 1. More regions followed. Bars, theaters, casinos and museums are closed. Restaurants are limited to takeout. Private gatherings among people from different households are mostly prohibited.\\n\\nChristian Dubé, the provincial health minister, said there’s more community transmission in more parts of the province than there was in the spring, when many outbreaks occurred in long-term care homes and cases were largely concentrated in Montreal.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Don’t take the risk,” he said. “Don’t test the system. . . . Stay home.”\\n\\nIn Ontario, testing centers are so overwhelmed that officials have tightened the criteria for who can get a test. A backlog of tens of thousands of samples has left officials flying blind on the source of infections and the scope of the problem. Toronto, Canada’s largest city, has scaled back contact tracing.\\n\\nOntario Premier Doug Ford, of the Progressive Conservative party, has responded with harsh words for rule breakers. The organizers of large social gatherings, he said, are “a few fries short of a Happy Meal.” The hundreds who attended a car rally in a parking lot in Hamilton last month should get their brains scanned, he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe had for several weeks resisted calls, including from Toronto’s top doctor, to do more. He said early last week that he needed to see more evidence before taking “someone’s livelihood away” and that the province was “flattening the curve.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut on Friday, Ford’s tone changed, and he warned that Ontario was at risk of the “worst-case scenarios” seen in northern Italy. He announced restrictions in hard-hit areas, including a ban on indoor dining at bars and restaurants, and the closing of indoor gyms, theaters and casinos for at least 28 days.\\n\\nInfectious-diseases specialists say the response has been hampered by muddled messaging. Dubé has admitted that communication in Quebec could have been better. Different officials in Ontario have offered varying definitions of “household” and contradictory advice on how or whether to gather for Thanksgiving — even within the same news conference.\\n\\nFord described his own holiday plans, then appeared to change them after it was pointed out that they contradicted his own government’s advice to celebrate only with those in one’s immediate household.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMorris, the University of Toronto professor, said the messaging mishaps risk damaging public trust in officials when it’s most needed.\\n\\n“There’s been a failure to recognize the inconsistent messaging . . . and an almost delusion that if you implore people to behave differently, then they will behave differently,” he said. “In almost every jurisdiction that hasn’t occurred, and we’ve failed to learn from other jurisdictions.”\\n\\nCanadians observe Thanksgiving each year on the second Monday of October. As in the United States, many celebrate with turkey, stuffing and pumpkin pie. College students return home.

An old friend sent it to Fiana Tulip. She was furious about her mom’s death; maybe she could channel her rage like Urquiza had. And Rosemary Rangel Gutierrez’s sisters told her about the obituary after their father died. She sounds like you, they said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNow, months after they first met online, their fury has intensified as an infected President Trump downplays the virus that devastated their families.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“This man is the most dangerous person on the planet,” Urquiza said this week after Trump told Americans on video not to be afraid of covid-19. “I’m counting down the minutes until his referendum comes on November 3rd and we can end this nightmare and protect ourselves and our families.”\\n\\nThe loose support group Urquiza formed has tightened into organized activism. They have pushed politicians, especially Republicans, to enact more serious public health measures. This week, across the country, they have led vigils, memorials and funeral processions to grieve the more than 213,000 lives lost in the United States. The national week of mourning is likely the largest collective recognition of the country’s coronavirus toll.\\n\\nPowerful grass-roots groups often have started this way, even before the days of organizing through social media. They began with personal anguish, with individuals grieving their dead alone, trying to transform their anger into action, policy or change. It’s the story of Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, of the Sandy Hook Promise and Never Again MSD, of Black Lives Matter and Mothers of the Movement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUrquiza named her group Marked by Covid. She founded it in the days after her father died, with some of his last words to her reverberating. He said he felt betrayed by Arizona’s governor and Trump, politicians he once supported. Urquiza, 39 and a recent graduate of a master’s program in public policy, decided then she would be the voice of a constituency that grows larger by the day: Americans who have lost loved ones to the pandemic and who are fed up with their elected officials.\\n\\n“I hope that my small actions can start a movement,” she said in July, less than two weeks after her dad died.\\n\\nIt’s too early to know how influential the group, or others like it, will become. Some of Urquiza’s fellow organizers joined her as a way to process loss, and it’s unclear how Marked by Covid will define itself when the pandemic ends. But part of Urquiza’s ambitious vision is to advocate for policies that address the racial and economic inequalities exacerbated by the virus.\\n\\nUrquiza and Marked by Covid have attracted national attention and more than 50,000 followers across their social media accounts. More than 1,000 people have donated $30,000 to the group, Urquiza said, and they’re using the money to place more honest obituaries online and in newspapers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Joe Biden campaign has taken notice. Urquiza spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August, appears in anti-Trump ads and sat in the front row at the first presidential debate, as Biden’s guest. She and her group have advocated for mask mandates and for a nationwide, data-driven response to the pandemic.\\n\\nThe network is made up of people still grieving as they organize get-out-the-vote campaigns, hold demonstrations and call out policy decisions in withering obituaries and editorials.\\n\\n“We’re there,” she said in August. “It’s a movement.”\\n\\nLess visible is how she and her new comrades got to this point, the moments of private agony that fuel them.\\n\\n‘A storm full of lightning and thunder’\\n\\nIt was mid-May, mid-pandemic and Arizona was reporting more new cases of the coronavirus every day. Urquiza was pleading with her father.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYes, she said, exasperated on the phone, Gov. Doug Ducey had just let his stay-at-home order expire, but, no, that didn’t mean it was suddenly safe to go out.\\n\\nBut Mark Anthony Urquiza, “Black Jack” to friends and family, had a ready reply: If it’s not safe, then why is the governor telling us it’s okay to go shopping, to go out to eat?\\n\\nHer father trusted his state’s Republican leader, and he trusted Trump, too; he had voted for them both.\\n\\nA gregarious man and karaoke enthusiast, he was eager to join his friends at a bar near his home in Phoenix. Around the same time, Ducey gave an interview to a local radio station.\\n\\n“I want to encourage people to get out and about, to take a loved one to dinner, to go retail shopping,” Ducey said. “If you don’t have an underlying health condition, it’s safe out there.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTwo weeks later, the coughing started. On June 16, Urquiza’s father went to the hospital and tested positive. Over the next 10 days, he reassured his daughter that he’d be fine, sending her photos of his hospital food and GIFs of a person jogging.\\n\\n“This will be me,” the onetime high school track star wrote. “I’m going to get out of this.”\\n\\nThen the messages stopped. In intensive care, he was put on a ventilator. Four days later, Mark Urquiza died. He was 65.\\n\\nThe Mexican American son of migrant farmworkers, Mark Urquiza was born and raised in Arizona and worked in the fields as a kid. He was a fierce patriot, his daughter said, who admired Trump for his business acumen and his fiscal policies. During the pandemic, when Urquiza’s manufacturing job was deemed essential, he was proud to go to work and support the stumbling economy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs Urquiza watched him struggle against the virus on video chat, from her house in San Francisco more than 600 miles away, she felt her rage building. She thought of Arizona’s expired stay-at-home order and the lack of a mask mandate. She remembered one of the last texts her dad sent her: “I feel sideswiped,” he wrote about his support of Trump and Ducey.\\n\\n“My dad thought he was doing the right thing and he was shortly thereafter in the hospital fighting for his life,” Urquiza said. “His government failed him and is failing us.”\\n\\nThe grief came at her in powerful waves. When they began to recede, her fury remained.\\n\\n“I feel like a storm full of lightning and thunder that is ready to come pouring down on the Arizona desert,” she said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLess than two months later, Urquiza was at the Democratic convention, delivering a scathing address.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“Thank you Kristin Urquiza for that incredible speech tonight,” commented one member of a Facebook group for bereaved loved ones. Another wrote: “She spoke for so many of us!”\\n\\n‘See what is being lost’\\n\\nFollowing along from St. Louis, Kender saw Urquiza amplify a message she had tried to spread in Missouri: People are dying, and our leaders aren’t doing enough.\\n\\nKender, whose mother died of the virus in June, traveled to the statehouse in August to meet the lawmakers gathering for a special session. They weren’t there to talk about the pandemic, or the nearly 1,500 Missourians it had by then killed, but Kender wanted to make sure they couldn’t ignore it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStanding inthe Jefferson City capitol, Kender unfurled a banner covered in the faces of state residents whose deaths she said were preventable. Among them: Gaye Griffin-Snyder, Kender’s mom, who was infected during an outbreak at her nursing home.\\n\\n“Covid families have had enough,” she said then, addressing the Republican-dominated legislature and Gov. Mike Parson, who has refused to adopt a statewide mask mandate. “I want you to see what is being lost,” Kender, 35, said. ”These are not just numbers, these are humans of all ages, of all levels of health. See these faces, recognize this could be your face and do something to protect us.”\\n\\nGriffin-Snyder grew up in a deeply conservative home but joined the civil rights movement in the 1960s. She later became a professional counselor.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMultiple sclerosis forced her into a nursing home when she was just 69. Two years later, after the coronavirus invaded, Kender found herself channeling her mother’s willingness to speak out.\\n\\n“This is not who I am,\" Kender said, “but this is who I am becoming.”\\n\\nShe plans to advocate for people who survived covid-19 but who may suffer its effects for the rest of their lives, and for the legions of health-care workers saddled with the trauma of serving on the pandemic’s front lines.\\n\\nSince Griffin-Snyder died June 6, new coronavirus cases in Missouri have soared from about 200 a day then to more than 1,300 in recent weeks. Kender has watched the numbers rise, waiting for Parson to require masks. Even after contracting the virus himself in September, Parson did not require masks.\\n\\n“I’m going to continue speaking,” she said. \"I’m going to continue doing everything I can to bring attention to the horrible choices being made.”\\n\\n‘Like she would have done’\\n\\nTulip’s mother died in Dallas on the Fourth of July, one of her family’s favorite holidays. That day, with fireworks crackling around her house in Brooklyn, Tulip began thinking of freedom.\\n\\nFreedom was the right that anti-mask activists claimed they were exercising when they refused to cover their faces. But it was this idea of freedom, Tulip thought, that accelerated the spread of the coronavirus, that propelled it into the rehab clinic where Isabelle Papadimitriou was a respiratory therapist, that led to it sickening and killing her.\\n\\n“I got angry so fast,” Tulip said. \"I couldn\\'t cry anymore. I started writing.”\\n\\nShe took to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, scouring her timelines for people posting memes about the ineffectiveness of masks or conspiracy theories about the country’s death toll.\\n\\n“Your decision killed my mother,” she wrote to one man, who had said that leaders pushing for social distancing measures “want this nation to be sheep” and he would “choose to die free.”\\n\\n“Enjoy your freedom,” Tulip replied.\\n\\nIt felt, she said, like a frenetic crusade.\\n\\n“I think I was trying to save my mom because I couldn’t accept that she was gone,” Tulip said. “I had to reconcile that I wasn’t saving my mom; I was saving others — like she would have done.”\\n\\nOnce a bank teller, Papadimitriou, 64, switched careers in her 30s because she wanted to help people breathe. She was healthy and working when she was infected, but in a matter of days, she was treating herself at home and struggling for air. She died a week after she recognized her symptoms.\\n\\nWhen a friend sent Tulip the obituary that Urquiza had written, she saw a way to focus her energy. She wanted to address Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who didn’t mandate face coverings until July 2 and whose administration she blamed for the growing number of virus deaths.\\n\\nThe two women started messaging on Facebook.\\n\\n“The way you’ve been sharing your dad’s story is beautiful,” Tulip wrote. “Only hope I can do the same for my mom.”\\n\\n“I can’t tell you how much it means to me to know that what I’m doing is helping you,” Urquiza replied. “Sending energy your way. We are not alone. And we will not allow them to be numbers.”\\n\\nThey agreed to work together, and Tulip soon published her own “honest obituary” that criticized the “carelessness of politicians who undervalue healthcare workers.”\\n\\nTulip, 40, and her husband were both laid off during the pandemic, and she spends her days caring for her young daughter, working with Marked by Covid and pushing for a memorial to virus victims in Brooklyn. She recently started working with Beat Abbott, a group raising money for the governor’s eventual challenger in 2022, and she has taken her activism to TikTok, where one video has been viewed more than 200,000 times.\\n\\n“I hate that my mom’s death is political,\" Tulip said. \"But it is.”\\n\\n‘A voice that I haven’t had before’\\n\\nJuan Carlos Rangel and his wife, Rosa, went to one of Brownsville’s free coronavirus testing sites in June. Their daughter Rosemary Rangel Gutierrez told them they might have to wait in line, so they showed up before dawn. They knew they needed a test; another daughter at home had tested positive.\\n\\nBut they were turned away. Too many people, not enough tests.\\n\\nLooking back at that moment, Gutierrez, who lives four hours north in San Antonio, now sees an ominous sign of what was to come for Brownsville and the surrounding Rio Grande Valley.\\n\\nThere were too many sick people, not enough resources, and running through it all, Gutierrez believed, was the state government’s neglect of a community that is overwhelmingly Hispanic.\\n\\n“There’s no way he can deny knowing the health demographics of the valley,” Gutierrez said of Abbott, who is a Republican. “It seems like neglect to not have enough testing, to not have enough hospital staff.”\\n\\nBy the time Gutierrez’s parents tested positive, her sister’s condition had deteriorated. She passed out at home, gasping for air. Rangel rushed her to the hospital. Three days later, he was hospitalized, too.\\n\\nThe facility was overwhelmed. Gutierrez’s family was in the middle of a burgeoning national virus hot spot. Gutierrez’s sister was released on July 1, but Rangel was still struggling. By Gutierrez’s 33rd birthday a week later, Rangel couldn’t get enough air to sing “Happy Birthday” with his daughter. Instead, she taught him sign language.\\n\\n“I love you,” he signed to her on video chat.\\n\\nTwo days later, his heart stopped as doctors tried to intubate him. On July 12, his kidneys began to fail. Gutierrez said goodbye to her father on WhatsApp. Two hours later, he died. Rangel was 60 years old.\\n\\nRangel loved to fish, metal detect, build and tinker. He taught Gutierrez to weld and inspired her to become a mechanical engineer. He was one of more than 2,500 Texans to die before Abbott issued a mask mandate.\\n\\n“I saw that as he was willing to sacrifice 2,500 people before taking action,” Gutierrez said.\\n\\nWhen sisters pointed out what Urquiza was doing, the two women connected. Urquiza introduced her to Tulip, and the three felt an immediate kinship.\\n\\n“It’s a little odd,” Gutierrez said. “You meet people because you lost someone, and you’re trying to make a difference in the world. At the same time, we’re all grieving and we have anxieties about it, but we’re pushing through, and we won’t be silenced.”\\n\\nGutierrez wrote Marked by Covid’s third honest obituary, criticizing the president and the Texas governor.\\n\\n“Trump and Abbott lose no sleep while people of color, unable to breathe, are suffocated by the virus each and every day,” Gutierrez wrote.\\n\\nThe virus has killed more than 16,000 people in Texas, the third highest total in the country. Hispanics account for 55 percent of those fatalities but make up 40 percent of the state’s population — a disparity that persists nationwide.\\n\\n“I care about the people of the valley. I care about the Hispanic community. And as long as we’re disproportionately affected, I need to be raising my voice,” Gutierrez said. “The honest obituary has given me a voice that I haven’t had before.”\\n\\nShe said she intends to be a watchdog, tracking the allocation of government pandemic relief resources to the Rio Grande Valley.\\n\\n“This is not a partisan issue,\" Gutierrez said. \"This is a human issue.”\\n\\n‘A seat at the table’\\n\\nUrquiza and her partner, Christine Keeves, are still shaping the future of Marked by Covid. They’re looking ahead, to a time when response becomes recovery, and they want to ensure that the people the pandemic has most affected play a role in shaping those policies.\\n\\n“I want us to have a seat at the table,” Urquiza said.\\n\\nShe wants her group to represent families of the fallen, front-line workers and those who survived the disease but may never fully recover. The country needs to take care of them, she said, and Marked by Covid will help ensure that happens, just as activists drove Congress to finance the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund.\\n\\nBut in the short term, Urquiza said she’ll continue working with people like Kender, Tulip and Gutierrez. She recently volunteered to be a surrogate for the Biden campaign and has partnered with a liberal health-care advocacy group in the lead-up to the election.\\n\\nThen, after Nov. 3, she’ll go home. She’ll spend the holidays in Arizona with her mother, doing all the stuff she’s put on hold: sort through her dad’s things, reminisce, laugh, cry and grieve.\\n\\nThere hasn’t been much time for any of that, and there haven’t been many places Urquiza can go to escape the pandemic and her packed schedule. But recently, she walked from the home she shares with Keeves through San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park until it opened onto the AIDS Memorial Grove. Cairns and inscriptions, ferns and dogwoods remember those lost in that last great public health disaster.\\n\\nShe lingered, watching other visitors come and go.'}, {'url': 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/mexico-border-tunnels-drugs/2020/10/09/0f4dafe8-0438-11eb-897d-3a6201d6643f_story.html', 'Full Text': 'Six Mexican national guardsmen wielding flashlights form the front line, tracking shovel-bearing drug traffickers through the seven-mile stretch of drainage and sewage lines on the Mexican side.

A law enforcement probe in 2018 into 11 interfaith marriages found no evidence of coercion.\\n\\nA prominent right-wing lawyer also shared the details of a Muslim employee of the company on Twitter, a move known as doxing, calling on his followers to “expose” Tanishq and make the company apologize.\\n\\nThe boycott call and the subsequent withdrawal of the ad is the latest instance of the bitter religious divide sweeping India under the Hindu nationalist government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He and his supporters envision India as a Hindu nation, not the secular republic enshrined in the Indian constitution.\\n\\nNearly 80 percent of the Indian population is Hindu, while Muslims make up 14 percent — which is still nearly 200 million people. After India gained independence from Britain and split into two countries with the birth of \\xadMuslim-majority Pakistan, India’s founders envisioned a secular republic in which all religions would have equal rights.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRelations between India’s Hindu majority and minority Muslims have come increasingly under strain since Modi assumed power in 2014. In August, Modi laid the foundation of a grand Hindu temple at a bitterly contested site where a 16th-century mosque was illegally razed by Hindu extremists. In February, Delhi was engulfed in the worst religious violence in decades, leaving dozens dead. Last year, Modi’s government passed a contentious law that makes religion a basis for citizenship — specifically excluding Muslim migrants — prompting fierce protests.\\n\\nIn a statement late Tuesday, Tanishq said it was withdrawing the ad in view of the “hurt sentiments” and “well-being” of employees and partners. The company said the idea behind its new collection — “Ekatvam,” or oneness — was to “celebrate the coming together of people from different walks of life” during “these challenging times.” The jewelry brand is a division of the Tata Group, one of the largest and oldest conglomerates in the country, with interests in energy, automobiles and consumer goods.\\n\\nThis isn’t the first time a brand in India has come under fire for promoting Hindu-Muslim harmony. Last year, an ad for a detergent showing a Hindu child protecting a Muslim child during the festival of colors elicited a boycott call, too.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHard-liners feel that ads such as these promote a secular viewpoint, which they see as a threat to the essential Hindu identity of India.\\n\\nInterfaith, and for that matter intercaste, marriages in India are frowned upon and often met with violence or stiff opposition.\\n\\nTwo of the country’s top advertising bodies condemned the threats against and targeting of Tanishq. In a statement, the Advertising Club said its review found that the ad is “not derogatory” toward any religion and does not hurt any national sentiment, while the Indian chapter of the International Advertising Association said the government should act against “intimidating behaviour.”\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKarthik Srinivasan, a communications strategy consultant, said a shift from online trolling to off\\xadline threats appeared to have tipped Tanishq to withdraw the ad.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n“I feel very sad that something that promotes unity is being withdrawn for the wrong reasons,” Srinivasan said.\\n\\n“We’ve always had intolerance,” he added, but it has been “emboldened” as those in power look away.\\n\\nShashi Tharoor, a member of the opposition Congress party, shared the ad on Twitter, saying, “If Hindu-Muslim ‘ekatvam’ irks them so much, why don’t they boycott the longest surviving symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity in the world — India?”\\n\\nCalling it “really sad,” one media executive asked why a brand as strong as Tanishq would “chicken out” in this manner.'}]\n"
